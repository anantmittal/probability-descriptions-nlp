While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into Vanderbilt and build a strong application.  School location: Nashville, TN  This school is also known as: Vanderbilt University, Vandy       Admissions Rate: 12%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at Vanderbilt is 12% . For every 100 applicants, only 12 are admitted.    This means the school is extremely selective . Meeting their GPA requirements and SAT/ACT requirements is very important to getting past their first round of filters and proving your academic preparation. If you don't meet their expectations, your chance of getting is nearly zero. After crossing this hurdle, you'll need to impress Vanderbilt application readers through their other application requirements, including extracurriculars, essays, and letters of recommendation. We'll cover more below.   Vanderbilt GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.8   The average GPA at Vanderbilt is 3.8 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 3.8, Vanderbilt
	  
	  requires you to be near the top of your class , and well above average. Your transcript should show mostly A's. Ideally, you will also have taken several AP or IB classes to show that you can handle academics at a college level.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.8, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to Vanderbilt. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. Vanderbilt SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1530 (Old: 2240)   The average SAT score composite at Vanderbilt is a 1530 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 2240 .  This score makes Vanderbilt Extremely Competitive for SAT test scores.    Vanderbilt SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1480, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1590. In other words, a 1480 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1590 will move you up to above average .  Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 780 750 800  Reading 39 37 40  Writing 38 36 39  Composite 1530 1480 1590     Vanderbilt SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 2120, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2360. In other words, a 2120 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2360 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 760 720 800  Reading 750 710 790  Writing 730 690 770  Composite 2240 2120 2360    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  Vanderbilt has the Score Choice policy of "Highest Section."  This is also known as "superscoring." This means that you can choose which SAT tests you want to send to the school. Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider your highest section scores across all SAT test dates you submit .  Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.   How does superscoring change your test strategy? (Click to Learn)   For example, say you submit the following 3 test scores:      Section  R+W  Math  Composite      Test 1  700  300  1000    Test 2  300  700  1000    Test 3  300  300  600    Superscore  700  700  1400      Even though the highest total you scored on any one test date was 1000, Vanderbilt will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore. You can raise your composite score from 1000 to 1400 in this example.  This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and Vanderbilt forms your Superscore, you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore. Your application readers will only see that one score.    Therefore, if your SAT superscore is currently below a 1590, we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it . You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.  Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the SAT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.    Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?

If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Vanderbilt ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, Vanderbilt likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 34   The average ACT score at Vanderbilt is 34. This score makes Vanderbilt Extremely Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 32, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 35.  Even though Vanderbilt likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 32 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 34 and above that a 32 will look academically weak.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 35 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Vanderbilt, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 35.    Studying for the ACT instead?

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  Vanderbilt requires you to take the SAT/ACT Writing section . They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that Vanderbilt requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   SAT II scores are not required but will be evaluated. Applicants in engineering are encouraged to take one of the SAT IIs in math. Furthermore, SAT II scores can be used for class placement, so if you have them you should send them.  Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is extremely selective, getting a high SAT/ACT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in . If you don't pass their SAT/ACT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration.  To have the best shot of getting in, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2360 SAT or a 35 ACT . You should also have a 3.8 GPA or higher. If your GPA is lower than this, you need to compensate with a higher SAT/ACT score.  For a school as selective as Vanderbilt, you'll also need to impress them with the rest of your application. We'll cover those details next.  But if you apply with a score below a 2360 SAT or a 35 ACT, you unfortunately start out with the odds against you and have a tiny chance of getting in. There are just too many students with high SAT/ACT scores and strong applications, and you need to compete against them.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into LSU and build a strong application.  School location: Baton Rouge, LA  This school is also known as: Louisiana State University       Admissions Rate: 76%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at LSU is 76% . For every 100 applicants, 76 are admitted.    This means the school is lightly selective . The school will have their expected requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores. If you meet their requirements, you're almost certain to get an offer of admission. But if you don't meet LSU's requirements, you'll be one of the unlucky few people who gets rejected.   LSU GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.43   The average GPA at LSU is 3.43 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 3.43, LSU
	  
	  requires you to be around average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, and very few C's. If you have a lower GPA, you can compensate with harder courses like AP or IB classes. This will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.43, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to LSU. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. LSU SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1210 (Old: 1147)   The average SAT score composite at LSU is a 1210 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1147 . (According to our records, this school requires only Reading and Math, so this score is out of 1600.)  This score makes LSU Competitive for SAT test scores.    LSU SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1100, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1320. In other words, a 1100 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1320 will move you up to above average .  Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 590 540 660  Reading 30 28 33  Composite 1210 1100 1320     LSU SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 1020, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1260. In other words, a 1020 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 1260 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 578 510 640  Reading 569 510 620  Composite 1147 1020 1260    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  LSU has the Score Choice policy of "Highest Sitting."  This means that you can choose which SAT tests you want to send to the school. Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider the SAT score from your single highest test date (the sum of math, reading, and writing).  This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and LSU only considers your highest score on a single test date, you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit your strongest score. Your application readers will only see that one score.  Therefore, if your SAT score is currently below a 1020, we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it . You don't have much to lose, and you can potentially raise your score and significantly boost your chances of getting in.    Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?    Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and SAT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 LSU ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, LSU likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 26   The average ACT score at LSU is 26. This score makes LSU Moderately Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 23, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 28.  Even though LSU likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 23 or below, you'll have a harder time getting in, unless you have something else impressive in your application.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 23 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to LSU, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 23.    Studying for the ACT instead?

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  LSU considers the SAT/ACT Writing section optional and may not include it as part of their admissions consideration. You don't need to worry too much about Writing for this school, but other schools you're applying to may require it.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that LSU requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   There are minimum admission requirements: you must have a 3.0 unweighted academic GPA based on 19 core units.  Additionally, students must meet either the ACT or SAT requirement: A 22 composite score on the ACT, with an 18 English subscore and a 19 math subscore, or  A 1030 Critical Reading and math composite SAT score, with at least a 450 critical reading score and a 460 math score.  Read more about admission requirements here.  There are higher requirements for scholarships, as listed here.   Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is lightly selective, you have a great shot at getting in, as long as you don't fall well below average . Aim for a 1020 SAT or a 23 ACT or higher, and you'll almost certainly get an offer of admission. As long as you meet the rest of the application requirements below, you'll be a shoo-in.  But if you score below our recommended target score, you may be one of the very few unlucky people to get rejected.

As a counselor at a highly selective college I frequently field questions about standardized testing.  I noticed in recent months, though, that many students I work with don’t apply testing statistics to their college search process appropriately.  Numbers aren’t helpful if you don’t understand their reference.  Here I break down testing statistics: questions to ask to be sure you understand the numbers and how to use the numbers once you understand them.     What’s your average SAT/ACT?  The answer to the above question is not helpful to prospective students.  Why?  First off, averages are susceptible to outliers.  Take the example below:  I have 5 students and their ACT scores are as follows: 30, 30, 30, 30, and 36.  Then the ACT average is 31.2.  If I go around reporting 31.2 as the ACT average a student with a 30 ACT has very little concept of how their testing fits into the picture.  They can’t see that the single 36 is pulling the average upwards.  Furthermore, there is a human tendency to process averages as a benchmark or cutoff.  I watch it happen all the time.  If I told a room of prospective students the average ACT was 31.2 the student with the score of 30 may think they are not a competitive candidate for admission.  Because of the reasons above and others, most colleges report testing as a range. Some of my students find this frustrating, as if a testing range conceals a benchmark, but I promise you they are far more illustrative.    What’s your testing range?  If I just tell you Vanderbilt’s testing range for ACT is 30 to 34 (or 1360 to 1530 for SAT), then you need to ask follow-up questions.  First, question to ask: does that range represent applied, admitted, or enrolled students?  Testing ranges for admitted students will almost always be higher than testing ranges for enrolled students simply because the highest testers have a greater number of post-secondary options.  FYI:  The ranges above are for our enrolled Class of 2014 ; the ranges for the admitted class were 31-34 and 1440-1540.  Another question to ask is: do you superscore tests?  At Vanderbilt we superscore the SAT and we do not superscore the ACT.  Therefore, the testing ranges we report reflect the highest Critical Reading + Math (regardless of test date) for the SAT and the highest ACT Composite in a single sitting.    What does the mid-50% mean?  The vast majority of the time you see testing ranges reported, they are reporting the 25 th percentile through the 75 th percentile, or the mid-50%.  Vanderbilt example: our Class of 2014 ACT mid-50% is 30-34.  Of our 1600 freshmen, 800 of those students have scores that fall at or between a 30 and 34; 400 students scored either a 35 or 36 on the exam and 400 scored 29 or below.  Reporting with ranges is helpful because outliers have less influence.  Additionally, prospective students have a broader understanding of the entire pool with the mid-50%.    I have a 29 on the ACT, am I a competitive applicant?  The answer to that question is the dreaded ‘I don’t know’.  Ranges are instructive because they help prospective students recognize we consider a wide swath of test scores.  There is no cut-off/benchmark/requirement.  There is also no formula or weight assigned to standardized testing at Vanderbilt.  We read applications in a holistic manner , looking at every piece of the puzzle.  Therefore, I won’t know if a student with a 29 ACT is a competitive applicant until I read the other chapters to their story.  Conversely, a student possessing a 35 or 36 on the ACT may look competitive from a testing perspective, but still not receive admission due to other factors.  No, seriously, am I a competitive applicant?  We read holistically, but I’m human and I understand that the testing profile is a convenient numerical way to gauge your competitiveness as an applicant.  Here’s what I tell my students: if you’re within the mid-50% you have a good foundation to your application (but remember there are many other pieces to the puzzle).  If you have a test score above our mid-50%, you have a great foundation.  Don’t slack on the rest of the application or you may not be happy with the result; also, if you have those great scores PLUS a great application we may chase you with merit money.  Finally, if you have a test score below our mid-50%, not all hope is lost!  A quarter of our current freshman class scored below that number and they’re on campus now.  However, with that lower test score, you’ve got to shine on the rest of the application.

I understand you want to hear the voice of the applicant, but what if the student failed to really choose an “interesting” topic or something that allowed them to stand out from the rest of the pool?  As long as the grammar and spelling is correct will the counselor deny an applicant based on a weaker essay?  Thank you for your response.    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  David:  There is no weight to the essay.  We have no weights at all in the process. For this reason a student can write a less-than-enthralling essay and still receive admission.  Sam, who I described in a previous post , did not have an essay topic that popped out at me, but he had amazing letters of recommendation.  The x-factor can be different for every student.    Elisa   December 10th, 2010  I have heard that some letters of acceptances will be mailed for ED1 candidates as early as today.  Can you tell me if that is occurring, or are you on track to mail every letter on December 15th, as previously posted? Thank you.    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  Elisa:  All of the letters are going out at the same time.  Right now it looks as if they will mail on either the evening of the 14th or the morning of the 15th.  They’re definitely not going out today!    David   December 10th, 2010  I had heard from several Vanderbilt students that they (in the past) received email acceptances.  Was that the case and is there any chance that we will hear online or phone, this year?    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  David: We do not release decisions via email unless the applicant is currently living outside of the United States.  Students cannot learn of their decisions via phone until December 21st.    Amber   December 10th, 2010  All this waiting is definitely making me nauseous. If it weren’t so obviously psychological I would strongly embrace the Pepto Bismol.    Sarah   December 10th, 2010  Of all of your students you have had for ED1, about how many have you accepted?    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  Sarah: We will publish these numbers at the close of Early Decision in February.    hugh   December 10th, 2010  do i still have a chance if my TOEFL is 95, which is below the minimum requirement?    Kylie   December 12th, 2010  Hugh: We will give every application a holistic review, but generally we are looking for TOEFL scores at 100 or above.    Hannah   December 11th, 2010  Thanks so much! This blog is helping me keep calm until ED1 decisions are mailed! This was also a helpful insight into what test scores really mean, how I fit into the numbers and how y’all view numbers!    Gibson   December 12th, 2010  So when should we expect our letters with our decision? On the 15th? Or later?    Christa   December 13th, 2010  Do Regular Decision applicants who turn in their apps. early find out any sooner than last-minute Regular Decisions?  Thanks!    Kylie   December 13th, 2010  Christa: No.  All RD students will receive notification according to our calendar : April 1st unless you are a scholarship recipient.    Sarah   December 19th, 2010  Hi! I hope all is well!  If I am applying for a scholarship, will the credentials I submit for the scholarship be viewed at the same time as my application for admission is reviewed? I am applying ED2, fyi.    Travis   December 29th, 2010  I heard some colleges only look at the English and math sections of the ACT.  Is this true for Vanderbilt?  My highest composite ACT score is a 30.  When I got the 30 I scored a 25 on the English section and a 35 on the math section.  However, on another test where my composite ACT score was a 29, I got a 32 on English and 34 on math.  Clearly, the english score is 7 points higher with the 29 composite score, yet 29 is a worse composite score than a 30.  Should I send my composite score of a 30 or a 29?  Please let me know! Thank you!    Kylie   December 30th, 2010  Travis:  We will consider your single highest composite score.    Robbie   January 28th, 2011  Hello! I commend all of you guys who have earned a 30 or higher on the ACT. I really wish that could be me hopefully in February. My question is, honestly, what are the number or students who have been accepted with a composite of 25? I have a low composite but I have a really good subscore of 29 in English and mid 20s in the other subtests. I also have good recommendations, rank,GPA, and essay. Do you think that I still have a chance at being accepted into Vanderbilt.    Kylie   January 28th, 2011  Robbie:  As much as I know this isn’t necessarily the answer you want- it depends.  Of our enrolled applicants who submitted ACT scores, 25% had scores lower than a 30.  Many different factors go into the application, it truly is more than just numbers.  Thus, knowing your testing doesn’t help me identify if you “have a chance”.  Know that admission is difficult for all of our applicants and I wish you the best of luck!    Christy   August 8th, 2011  In our town my daughter has the opportunity to attend a selective magnet high school or attend a typical high school that offers the “IB” diploma.  Which would be more attractive to Vanderbilt (all other things being equal). She really has her heart on being a student at Vandy! I was going to call and ask, but I stumbled across this blog and thought I might give this a shot. Thanks!    Tricia   October 25th, 2011  Do you now superscore the ACT?    Ryan Burleson   October 26th, 2011  Thanks for your question, Tricia. We don’t superscore the ACT, we just consider a student’s highest composite score. Our position is that the ACT is not as well-suited to be superscored because of the nature of the test. There is simply not as much wiggle room for the ACT since it is only based on a 36 point scale.    julie   December 20th, 2011  Just wondering how merit money or the discount rate is at your school for strong students.  My parents have no savings for college due to loss of a job a few years in the past and the three siblings that will need college after me.  But on a financial aid form their income currently is way too high for aid.  I have a strong resume of school activities, a GPA of over 4 and ACT of 31.  I am top in my school but don’t have an ACT of 36 to put me over into the extreme numbers category. What does the picture look like for a student like me.  I am beginning to think the best colleges are only for the poor and the truly wealthy,upper middle class need not apply? Julie    Carolyn Pippen   December 20th, 2011  Hi Julie,  Our need-based financial aid process if very extensive and takes into account much more than just the parents’ income (things like, I have four siblings in school, or all of our money is in assets, etc).  This is why we actually require two forms – the FAFSA and the CSS Profile – to make sure we have considered all aspects of your financial situation.  Once you have filled out these forms, we garauntee to meet 100% of your demonstrated need, loan-free.  In addition, we do have merit-based scholarships as well.  I highly encourage you to apply for both of these forms of aid, regardless of what you think your package might turn out to be. For more information feel free to visit the financial aid website ( http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/financial-aid-facts.php ) or contact our Financial Aid office at 615-322-3591.    Tootie   January 2nd, 2012  hi i graduate in 2019 and ive been researching on collages and before i decided to do this my only choices were harverd or yale to get my law degree but now you guys are in my options list! You guys rock and thanks for being their for us and hopefully i get the right SAT or ACT score to be accepted!    What Advice Would You Give to this (hypothetical) Child? - Higher education - Page 2 - City-Data Forum   February 17th, 2013  […]   From Vanderbilt, read the section under I have a 29 on the ACT, am I a competitive applicant?

Mihika   December 14th, 2014  Hello, my Sat score is quite low and my score was 1640. Should i still apply to Vanderbilt University or not? What are my chances?    Jay Watson   December 15th, 2014  Hi Mihika, thanks for your question. The best resource to start with is the profile of our current students (here: http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/profile/ ). With the profile, you can see how your scores compare to our middle 50%. As we say in the post, we can’t know your chances without reviewing the rest of your application (not to mention the rest of the applicant pool). The middle 50% gives you a good starting place to evaluate your application – beyond that, it would be a good idea to speak with your admissions counselor to discuss other aspects of your application. You can find your counselor’s contact information at http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/your-counselor/ Thanks!    Grace   October 2nd, 2015  Does the fact that I have not joined one club in high school lower my chances of being accepted?    Jay Watson   October 2nd, 2015  Thanks for your question. Just as we don’t have cut-off scores for testing, we don’t have minimums for club or organization involvement. Instead, we evaluate activities outside the classroom in terms of depth of involvement, roles and responsibilities, and leadership. We want to know what you spend your time on and what you’re passionate about. That doesn’t have to be a high school club – it could be volunteer work, a business or non-profit you started or work for, some kind of artistic or athletic endeavor, or many other things. Again, thanks for your question!    Jason Knapp   January 12th, 2016  How does a high rising trend look to the committee? Example: Someone who started off with a 3.1 freshman year, 3.4 sophomore year and a 3.9 this year. Also I am a volunteer EMT, so would that help at all? Thanks!    Jay Watson   January 12th, 2016  Hi Jason, thank you for your question. A positive trend in your GPA through high school is definitely favorable. Remember that our academic evaluation takes into consideration the rigor of your curriculum – we’re not just looking for strong grades, but we also want to see that you are making those strong grades in classes that are challenging. Your experience as an EMT is also something that will be considered. If that is something you are truly passionate about, make sure that comes through in your application. Again, thanks for your question and your interest in Vanderbilt!    Connor Castleberry   February 22nd, 2016  How much is the ACT writing portion considered? I got a 35 ACT composite score but a 14 for my writing. Thank you for your response.    Jay Watson   February 29th, 2016  Thanks for your question. First, remember that standardized testing is only a part of our holistic application process. And while the writing portion of the ACT is required, the composite score is the more important factor in our process.    Vivian Hsu   April 19th, 2016  As an international student from Asia, I studied high school since my freshman year. English is not my native language. May I have an idea if you will consider it being a factor for lower SAT 2040?    Jay Watson   April 21st, 2016  Thanks for your question. Applicants whose native language is not English have specific admissions requirements. You should check our requirements for international students page at http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/apply/international.php     Harrison   May 3rd, 2016  How much does the score of your essay on an ACT affect the admissions process? For example, I got a 35 composite ACT score but I messed up the essay and only got an 18 on the essay. Also, I have a 750 on SAT English section. If i were to send both SAT and ACT scores, do I need to worry about the essay score or do you think the low essay score might be disregarded considering my admissions essays and high SAT English score? Thanks!    Jay Watson   May 11th, 2016  Thanks for your question, Harrison. Beginning with admission for the Class of 2021, the writing section of the ACT and the Essay section of the SAT are not required. You can also talk more thoroughly about your individual testing with your Vanderbilt admissions counselor. Thanks.    Cristina   September 6th, 2016  I have a question regarding gpa. Do you guys count the weighted gpa or unweighted gpa? Also, I volunteer at the Audobon Center, which works with environmental matters and what I want to major in is environmental science and I took AP Environmental Science and passed with a 4, would this favor me when it comes to admissions?    Jay Watson   September 20th, 2016  Hi Cristina, thanks for your questions. Regarding GPA, we evaluate based on what your high school reports on your official transcript. And, yes, we do consider your “fit” for the academic school to which you are applying, and your academic record and outside involvement are certainly considered. Again, thanks for your interest.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into Vanderbilt and build a strong application.  School location: Nashville, TN  This school is also known as: Vanderbilt University, Vandy       Admissions Rate: 12%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at Vanderbilt is 12% . For every 100 applicants, only 12 are admitted.    This means the school is extremely selective . Meeting their GPA requirements and SAT/ACT requirements is very important to getting past their first round of filters and proving your academic preparation. If you don't meet their expectations, your chance of getting is nearly zero. After crossing this hurdle, you'll need to impress Vanderbilt application readers through their other application requirements, including extracurriculars, essays, and letters of recommendation. We'll cover more below.   Vanderbilt GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.8   The average GPA at Vanderbilt is 3.8 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 3.8, Vanderbilt
	  
	  requires you to be near the top of your class , and well above average. Your transcript should show mostly A's. Ideally, you will also have taken several AP or IB classes to show that you can handle academics at a college level.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.8, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to Vanderbilt. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. Vanderbilt SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1530 (Old: 2240)   The average SAT score composite at Vanderbilt is a 1530 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 2240 .  This score makes Vanderbilt Extremely Competitive for SAT test scores.    Vanderbilt SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1480, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1590. In other words, a 1480 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1590 will move you up to above average .  Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 780 750 800  Reading 39 37 40  Writing 38 36 39  Composite 1530 1480 1590     Vanderbilt SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 2120, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2360. In other words, a 2120 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2360 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 760 720 800  Reading 750 710 790  Writing 730 690 770  Composite 2240 2120 2360    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  Vanderbilt has the Score Choice policy of "Highest Section."  This is also known as "superscoring." This means that you can choose which SAT tests you want to send to the school. Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider your highest section scores across all SAT test dates you submit .  Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.   How does superscoring change your test strategy? (Click to Learn)   For example, say you submit the following 3 test scores:      Section  R+W  Math  Composite      Test 1  700  300  1000    Test 2  300  700  1000    Test 3  300  300  600    Superscore  700  700  1400      Even though the highest total you scored on any one test date was 1000, Vanderbilt will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore. You can raise your composite score from 1000 to 1400 in this example.  This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and Vanderbilt forms your Superscore, you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore. Your application readers will only see that one score.    Therefore, if your SAT superscore is currently below a 1590, we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it . You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.  Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the SAT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.    Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?    Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and SAT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Vanderbilt ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, Vanderbilt likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 34   The average ACT score at Vanderbilt is 34. This score makes Vanderbilt Extremely Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 32, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 35.  Even though Vanderbilt likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 32 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 34 and above that a 32 will look academically weak.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 35 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Vanderbilt, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 35.    Studying for the ACT instead?

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  Vanderbilt requires you to take the SAT/ACT Writing section . They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that Vanderbilt requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   SAT II scores are not required but will be evaluated. Applicants in engineering are encouraged to take one of the SAT IIs in math. Furthermore, SAT II scores can be used for class placement, so if you have them you should send them.  Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is extremely selective, getting a high SAT/ACT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in . If you don't pass their SAT/ACT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration.  To have the best shot of getting in, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2360 SAT or a 35 ACT . You should also have a 3.8 GPA or higher. If your GPA is lower than this, you need to compensate with a higher SAT/ACT score.  For a school as selective as Vanderbilt, you'll also need to impress them with the rest of your application. We'll cover those details next.  But if you apply with a score below a 2360 SAT or a 35 ACT, you unfortunately start out with the odds against you and have a tiny chance of getting in. There are just too many students with high SAT/ACT scores and strong applications, and you need to compete against them.

More info on the process here.   There are three major merit scholarships with deadlines of December 1st and December 15th. To apply, you have to submit your regular Vanderbilt application, after which you will be able to access your online Vanderbilt admission account and apply for scholarships. Note how far before the regular admission deadline of January 5th the scholarship deadlines are, and plan accordingly! The application for these scholarships will also be considered for other, smaller merit scholarships. Learn more about the process here.

CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014    edited August 2014   in Vanderbilt University      My daughter is planning to apply Early Decision at Vanderbilt this fall. Any idea what her chances are?  Stats are:  GPA: Unweighted 3.89 Weighted 4.05 (All challenging courses throughout HS, including AP, honors and multiple advanced and dual-enrollment courses. Five additional dual-enroll courses will be completed this year, including calculus.) ACT: 10th grade - 30 11th grade - 31 (She will be taking it again before deadline) NHS: 11th grade - Treasurer 12th grade - President Choir - 4 years Volleyball - 4 years (co-captain 2 years) Pre-Cal award - 11th grade Spanish award - 10th grade Spanish II award - 11th grade (her dad's parents are Cuban so she had an advantage in that) Tutors Pre-Cal & Algebra  Thanks for any input on this.     0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook       « 1 2 »      Go  Replies to: What are my D's chances of getting into Vanderbilt?       #1     lacsalltheway    Registered User  Posts: 19  New Member      August 2014       Hello.  I am a current student at Vandy.  Standardized testing-wise, I would say she is on the lower side.  However, her GPA is very promising.  Her extracurriculars are not very impressive.  However, I think she definitely has a shot IF she does early decision.  She will have a better chance if she can raise the ACT score to a 33 or 34.  But I encourage her to apply early decision.  There is a place for everyone at Vanderbilt, and I have not heard one student say that they are not happy at this school.  Early decision would greatly benefit her with her chances of getting in.  For early decision, I would say she has a 50/50 shot of getting in, honestly.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014       Thank you for the input! We are hoping that the ACT score will come up some. Regarding extracurriculars, she goes to a very small private school that honestly doesn't offer a whole lot in that realm. However, she is consistently involved in organizing the blood drive (Blood Assurance) and volunteers for the ESL program. I didn't mention those earlier since they are volunteer activities set up through NHS. Honestly, I wasn't sure if they should be counted separately since they are done as part of her NHS commitment. Thanks again for your response!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     lacsalltheway    Registered User  Posts: 19  New Member      August 2014       No problem. Do not be discouraged with the test scores.  I know many students here who were in the same position as your daughter and got into this school.  She definitely is a competitive applicant because her GPA is very good.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014       I should also have mentioned that her senior project is implementing a sadly lacking recycling/go green program at her school and starting a club to continue the work and advocate for the cause after she's gone. Hoping that will be well underway by the time she applies so she can include it on her app.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     KaMaMom    Registered User  Posts: 888  Member      August 2014       Hi there ... my daughter was admitted ED1 this past year.  And the gist I get from all of the admits that I know about is that their GPAs were near perfect, ACT/SAT were very high and though they were very busy with ecs, there was one ec that really stood out ... if musically talented, then lots of involvement and all-state band or all-state choir, if forensics, they were national qualifiers or there was a twist on a "typical extra curricular", etc..  And not a twist for a twists sake ;) but their passion really showed through.  But from personal experience, if Vandy is her first choice, ED is definitely the way to go.  I believe the acceptance rate is somewhere around 20% for ED and drops drastically for RD.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     bud123    Registered User  Posts: 673  Member      August 2014       The admission process at the most selective U's is not an exact science.  Parents and students want to know #'s and boxes to check but ADCOMs talk about building a class, diversity, and the holistic process.  How does OZ behind the curtain determine which qualified students get to go to Kansas??? The best you can do is look at the admission data to get an idea of what each U looks at.  Vandy's SAT/ACT scores are now higher than 5/8 ivies , Duke and Stanford.  It's fair to say someone is looking closely at these scores.  The Vandy admissions blog year after year report 100% of incoming students received significant awards or held significant leadership positions.  Not 99%, 100%.  Someone is looking at these EC's.  47% are varsity athletes, 37% held major positions or received awards in the fine arts.  So it helps to excel at something outside the classroom.  Schools also like students that use their smarts to improve their school or the community. Your D has a strong application.  Get that ACT to 33, take the SAT too and send the higher score, write a great essay, and talk to teachers who can write her an outstanding LoR.  2   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014       Good info! Thank you:) Yes, she is working hard to bring her score up a couple points. And the LoR's will be no issue. My main concern is extracurriculars...also leadership. I'm not sure if NHS pres and VB co-captain is enough. Thanks for your encouragement!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #8     kaukauna    Registered User  Posts: 1,085  Senior Member      August 2014       NHS President and VB captain are both good.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     doubleeternity    Registered User  Posts: 72  Junior Member      August 2014       Please let me be brutally honest. I am sorry but I do not think your daughter is a strong ED applicant, as yet. Her GPA is very good, but most successful Vanderbilt applicants have similar or better GPAs. Her test scores obviously are a bit too low for a strong candidate. Vanderbilt is ranked 7th in the nation by SAT/ACT scores. Its average scores (including ED) are 1490 and 33 respectively, which place Vanderbilt above Stanford, Duke and UPenn, and only Harvard, Yale, Princeton among the ivies are better than Vanderbilt. Further, your daughter's ecs do not seem very impressive.  So, if your daughter is seriously interested in Vanderbilt, I believe she NEEDS to 1. improve her SAT/ACT scores (which will also give her a better chance at other good schools) 2. keep on her good work at school so that she could maintain/better her GPA 3. write a really impressive essay to demonstrate why she is special (Remember, it takes time to write a good essay) 4. be realistic (only 20% of very qualified ED applicants will be admitted) and make good backup plans  Your daughter has been doing excellently, and you should be proud of your daughter regardless of the outcome of her Vanderbilt application. I hope she will get admitted to Vanderbilt if that is what she wants.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014       Thank you for the input:) Guess we'll see soon enough..  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      December 2014       Big decision day is getting close...one more question for anyone that wants to weigh in. High school guidance counselor told her that Vanderbilt called "asking a whole lot of questions about her". Is this pretty routine or a good sign? Counselor didn't elaborate on the conversation, nor did Kris ask her to. She DID say counselor seemed excited for her...but then Joan is ALWAYS happy and bubbly lol..so IDK how seriously to take this:/ Any thoughts?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #12     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      December 2014       Or is it, heaven forbid, a bad sign? As in, they're picking her apart or questioning something on her app? But I can't think of anything on her app that could possibly be in question. Also, I can't imagine her counselor would have been so cheerful if she felt the conversation with the Vandy person was a negative. I'm probably just overthinking it:/  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #13     DoremomCT    Registered User  Posts: 34  Junior Member      December 2014       I would hope for the best. They're probably not making phone calls about the definite "yes" kid but they're *certainly* not making calls for a clear "no." She's probably on the bubble and they're trying to gather additional information to help their decision making.

ECs look good as well.  Unfortunately, we can only give you a very general sense of where your app is from a CC post, but I'd say you have solid chances. Everything is where it should be, but you're not an absolute lock. At this point, all you can do is make sure the subjective portions of your app (essays, recs) are high quality and see what happens.  Chances of admissions are greater in the ED round (although it's hard to predict how EDII works vs EDI/RD), so it would be a good idea to run the net price calculator and also decide which school is your first choice. If Vanderbilt's on top, and seems financially doable, pulling the trigger on ED would be a good idea. It's likely that with a large number of applications you would be accepted at a top 20 school in the RD round, but you just can't be sure where that will be. You definitely wouldn't be out of the running for RD either, but a lot of good candidates end up waitlisted.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     ver1818    Registered User  Posts: 3  New Member      November 2017       Thank you for the advice!

I took the campus tour and admissions information session a couple years ago.  I learned that roughly half the class comes from early decision but only 15% of all applications are ED.  So it appears that applying early will really boost your chances.  If you apply early, you will also be organized enough to apply for the merit scholarships, which require some additional work but can be well worth the time invested.

Your current volunteer work looks a little haphazard (I'm sure you enjoy it all, but a little here and a little there says less than if you were to spend more time in one place).

VU is no less holistic than any other top U.  They are just doing a better job of enrolling more of these students. Check out their CDS for the numbers needed.  They also report 100% of accepted students have received major awards or held significant leadership positions.  100%, not 99%.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     londondad    Registered User  Posts: 2,124  Senior Member      April 2017       ^ It just seems that compared to a number of factors that their average SAT scores just seem higher than peer schools so I bet that their holistic admissions process is more weighted to SAT scores than similar schools. I was surprised to see that their EBRW 75% level is "only" 770.  I'm sure that they will try and get that number up if they use their waitlist.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     amNotarobot    Registered User  Posts: 168  Junior Member      April 2017       Early Decision, especially ED1.

While Vandy is of course holistic like all top 25 schools are, the numbers don't lie.  The 25-75 ACT range for Vandy's 2020 enrolled class was 32-35.  That's the same as Princeton.  Stanford's was 31-35.  School's like Vandy in the 11-25 band obviously weight test scores more heavily than the 1-10 schools do.  There's no single magic bullet.  But if you really want to get into Vandy, applying ED with a 35 ACT is a great start.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #13     bernie12    Registered User  Posts: 4,890  Senior Member      April 2017    edited April 2017        @northwesty :  And then there was Cornell, Emory, Georgetown, Berkeley, Dartmouth, and Brown.  Interesting catch for the top 10 though.  Even those with really high scores have been in the same score range for years or a decade.  They have maybe been slightly fluctuating up and down but haven't been trying desperately to add 10-20 points each year.  And the schools I refer to are HYPMCoCh(Ch is new to the score emphasis.  It changed to the same admissions scheme as VU, WUSTL)  and of course Caltech (this is just natural at STEM schools).  Then there is another cohort that are basically identical score wise that, for SAT, have taken a while to or refuse to hit 1400 for the bottom 25%.  These are Duke, Penn, Stanford, and JHU (though JHU has shot up and appears to be using the scheme that increases the scores quickly) as as far as I know.  But even among those in the high score brackets.  The score in that range will do little to predict an admit or wait-list because many applying in their score range are applying as a top choice for sure meaning more folks in those ranges will be denied than at other schools where the yield is solid but still much lower.  They pretty much just focus on other things when even around the score range.   In addition, Vanderbilt is one of the places that used to give a  speech on the admissions website about how SAT levels the playing field. I have also read language in strategic planning documents suggesting that their admissions is now a "meritocracy" which suggests intentionality(made up word) and a potential agenda.  So they could have begun placing that much emphasis on the scores due to a mixture of wanting to drive up the rank and also because of these ideals.   There is also this which I find strange: https://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/vandybloggers/2017/02/class-of-2021-early-decision-summary-statistics/  Why list a percent of students that has a "major" leadership position?  It almost seems as if the admissions office has caught on to students perception the stats emphasis so they write in distractors like that to suggest that they care just as much, which they may, but that is a very strong claim and one may want to know how that is defined.  It just reads a bit fake, like when a certain president's press person comes out and says "biggest inauguration ever!".  I mean, why say anything about it?   Either way, Vanderbilt is not the only non-STEM Ivy using this admissions scheme.  I just do not understand why use it.  Increasing the scores will do very little for performance beyond a certain threshold.  Perhaps schools like Chicago can almost justify it because they still known for a much more stressful academic environment than peer schools and were known for it before they chose to pump of SATs.  But for schools generally not known for super stressful academics (and this is giving them benefit of the doubt, I think other metrics can be used to measure students ability to handle this because these schools are not usually stressful because the courses give multiple choice tests that are  quite coachable.  They are known for heavier workloads and maybe exams that are intentionally unpredictable or unusually challenging), I do not really see the point.  I guess you'll start seeing higher grades in disciplines that are considered easier? Or ones where multiple teachers still do have multiple choice (easy MC at that) as the major form of assessment?  Which, I think should not be the case at any elite school.  I just think the emphasis should be tailored to predict success in much more challenging situations (but we all know it has nothing to do with maintaining or enhancing academic standards.  It has nothing to do with undergraduates themselves at all.  Who wants to bet that each cohort that has 50SAT points or .5ACT points higher than the last has almost exactly the same EC profile at these schools?).  Apparently, while GPAs and class rank are inflated, they have been shown to have more predictive capabilities by many studies.  These elite highered maneuvers in admissions just get old to me.  They already have high achieving student bodies.  Instead of trying to make the SAT average a 1550/1600 instead of a 1540, get back to ensuring that these folks get a challenging, modern education that the schools are supposed to deliver on.  Using the admissions office to represent the prestige and quality of the school is just getting old and nearly all are guilty.  rant over:  Until they stop focusing on this, if you applying to one of those schools, aim for a 35-36 if you desperately want to get in.  It will not remotely guarantee you but chances will be more correlated than at other schools.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #14     bernie12    Registered User  Posts: 4,890  Senior Member      April 2017    edited April 2017       BTW, the first list are basically schools that have yet to have an incoming class with a 1400 25% on the old SAT as far as I know.  Really, there are maybe only 2-3 in the 15-25 bracket that have met and surpass that bar.  And the thing is you can't just claim all the others are failing.  Dartmouth, Brown, and Cornell definitely have a choice, and it appears they are choosing not to.  Even many of the elite LACs choose not to and they very well could I bet.  So among places with the super high application volume (and even those who don't like Rice which is getting close), it appears to be a choice.  Most schools remain normal and saw periods of normal growth in admissions and some chose schemes that got much quicker change to the score brackets as soon as the application volume increased.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #15     bernie12    Registered User  Posts: 4,890  Senior Member      April 2017    edited April 2017       Just some evidence that there is a particular strategy that can be employed (and has been) if you want a quicker rise in stats and national standing (basically these patterns of sudden popularity and high app. volume for certain schools is not magical or prospective students "waking up" all of the sudden).   Chicago's changes were highlighted here.  Seems the schools outside of the top 10 with unusual high score brackets employed similar strategies for different reasons and sadly, I think in terms of the rank, USNews has caught on.  There seems to be a ceiling for schools without the academic reputation of some of those top 10 schools.  Hence, why WUSTL can fluctuate despite it also having HYPM like score range. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/education/edlife/07HOOVER-t.html .  Again, schools employing this strategy should now refocus efforts on offering differing academics than competitor schools because this method has its limits in terms of attracting certain types of students and has marginal effects on the rankings for some places.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook        « 1 2 3 4 »      Go    Sign In or Register to comment.

I, however, only have a 2070/2400 or a 1350/1600. What I would like to know is do I even have a chance at getting into Vanderbilt with my score? Should I just expect rejection because of my score or is there another weak point on my application that will also affect my admission decision?  Does anyone think I have a chance at getting in? Here are my stats.   School: I am a senior and I attend a very small Catholic college preparatory high school in a rural area that has like 46 students total. My own senior class has only 11 students. My school offers very little AP's and no honors classes. I've been offered only AP US History (junior year) and AP Calculus AB (senior year) both of which I have taken or am taking. In order to challenge myself I took AP US Government and Politics through an online independent course my Junior year. In my senior year I am taking both AP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics through an online independent course (I'm interested in business. I am also taking three classes through a dual-enrollment program (between my high school and a local community college). They are Principles of Biology, Biology Lab, and Basic Public Speaking. In addition, I am taking College Web Design and Development independently online through a community college. In high school I have also taken College Algebra and Writing I.  Course Load: Junior Year: AP US History and AP US Gov (apart from the other regular classes I take) Senior Year: AP Calculus AB, AP Micro, AP Macro, College Web Design and Development, College Bio, College Speech (apart from the other regular classes I take)  GPA: around a 3.94 (UW) and 4.0 (W) This is only freshman through junior year. Freshman Year: 3.77 (I got a couple B+'s. :\) Sophomore Year: 4.0 Junior Year: 4.21 Senior Year: With all A's at the end could be like a 4.3 I think.  Recommendations: Getting one from a history teacher who I think really likes me and Literature teacher who said she'd love to write me one. I'm also sending in one from the manager of a local brokerage firm I interned at.  Essay: About a very close family friend who recently passed away. I didn't make it a sympathy story, but rather how he was like a wise and funny grandfatherly figure in my life. I also explained some hardships he overcame and how he overcame those hardships and how I should be able to overcome hardships too. (Btw the 500 limit is really hard to stay in)  Class Rank: 1/11 (Like I said my school is tiny)  Scores: SAT: 2070 (670 CR, 680 M, 720 W) SAT Subject Tests: 760 US History (because of background from AP US history) and a really really bad Bio score (no AP Bio was offered to me and it really made SAT Bio tough for me) I don't plan to send.

The Middle 50% with SATs of 1400-1580 means a quarter of the class comes in with something below a 1400. A 1350 isn't far off and you have a great profile.

I just would like to ask a few more things. What type of applicants are usually accepted in the lower 25%? I mean no disrespect to anyone, but aren't a portion of these acceptances given to athletes who may be so committed to a sport and therefore unable to have such high scores or grades or even people who have not had the opportunities or resources as others? (I do not mean to stereotype athletes, minorities, or anyone for that matter. I know there are plenty who have better scores, grades, etc. than me.) Also, many people have brought up the argument that if your Asian you must have a "high score" or it is almost expected. I would really like what you have to say about all these questions because you are a current Vandy student right? Once again thanks in advance!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     Pancaked    Registered User  Posts: 3,355  Senior Member      February 2013       A portion of them are athletes, yes, but recruited athletes do not make up 25% of the student body. I can't really tell you much about the profiles of the lower 25% other than they are probably better than the typical accepted student, other than SAT score.  There are some schools where Asian students are overrepresented and as such are at a slight disadvantage in admissions. This is not the case at Vanderbilt.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     Love2Travel95    Registered User  Posts: 28  New Member      February 2013       Also a Vandy applicant. 1350/1600, 2130/2400 (low Critical Reading) Math Level 2: 780 (although with 6 B's in Honors Math, and 1 C in AP Calculus - the MAIN reason for my 3.7 UW) I come from a very competitive high school in Cali. 3.7 UW, 4.0 W with an upward trend.

All other varsity athletes get into Vandy the same way as everyone else--with high GPAs, lots of APs, high SAT/ACT scores and good recommendations. There are two differences between these athletes and the traditional candidate:  1) They sign a NLI which binds them to the school and 2) They participate in their sport 25-30 hours a week while getting high GPAs, high SAT/SCT scores, taking 5 APS, etc.  Therefore, the bottom 25% of applicants do not have a substantial number of athletes in the mix. The bottom 25% are simply great students that perhaps do not test well, or bring another stellar attribute (music, theater, public speaking, community service, etc.) to the community as a whole that is not reflected in test scores.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     HaveYouMetTed    Registered User  Posts: 39  Junior Member      February 2013       Thanks for your feedback @Pancaked and @vandyswim .

I hold an internship right now, am an officer of my Finance academy at my school, attend Young Life, play varsity basketball, mentor... yada yada yada  Question 1: Basically, HOW DO I GET INTO VANDERBILT? I plan on taking the ACT again, but if my aim is to get admitted into Vanderbilt, what score should I shoot for? My SAT score was 1980, but that was long ago. Any other advice for getting into Vanderbilt would be greatly appreciated. Of course, being from Texas, I will also be applying to UT.

Due to the convenience of the common app Vandy and other top schools are receiving 25k applications for the 1 -2k spots available for freshmen.

Looking back, I really believe that applying ED gives you a better shot.  If you apply RD you are more likely to get lost in the shuffle considering the volume of applications they receive at that time.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     2VU0609    Registered User  Posts: 3,189  Senior Member      June 2010       timeflew, I can assure you that the essays are read.

However, I still think that if funnysac really, really wants to go to Vandy applying ED would be an advantage.  There were LOTS of kids with dream resumes waitlisted at Vandy this year, and I have to believe that it was at least in part because lots of other kids with dream resume's had sent in their applications earlier.  When they already have a huge YES stack, are counselors really going to spend as much time with later applications?  Perhaps yes, but why not apply ED and lessen the odds of getting lost in the crowd later?  I think this is true for all of the tow 20 schools since common app came on the scene.  2VU0609, do you have any advice for funnysac and other prospects on how to stand out in a crowd of high stat applicants?  Any inside info that can help them?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     2VU0609    Registered User  Posts: 3,189  Senior Member      June 2010       When my kids applied the applicant pool was much smaller.  Both the child who worked in admissions and the good friend of that child who worked there as a student worker and for a year following graduation (not the admissions counselor) used to joke that they weren't confident that they would be admitted several years later.  ED is a distinct advantage.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     timeflew    Registered User  Posts: 608  Member      June 2010       I can't decide if I like or hate the common app.  It certainly has changed the admissions landscape, hasn't it?  Here's to happy outcomes for everyone - no matter where you end up!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #12     jc40    Registered User  Posts: 1,622  Senior Member      June 2010       Funnysac...I would agree to a certain extent with what has been said. If Vanderbilt is your first choice, and financial aid is not an issue, apply ED. If, on the other hand, $ is a concern (perhaps you're budgeting for grad school as well) or if there are schools you like slightly more, apply RD. My D loved Vandy and always thought she'd wind up attending; however, at the time she applied, there were a few schools she also really liked. Her argument was if she applied ED, she might always wonder "what if".  Suffice to say, she did RD. Like TimeFlew's D, she was waitlisted with VERY, VERY impressive stats/ecs/essays. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest. (She was also waitlisted at most all of the ivys.) So, in hindsight would she have done things differently? Probably not. She did get accepted at some great schools, and after dome recovery time, she's now very excited about the school she'll be attending. For what it's worth, here are a few things you might consider when making your decision:  A) Certain schools/colleges within Vandy are easier to get into than others. You might think about this when applying. B) You're from a heavily represented state, so competition will be more intense. C) RD rate dropped this year to 13+% from 20 something percent last year.

Visualize yourself making life long friends at match colleges..attend classes there as well as at reach colleges.  Realize that there are scores of colleges with professors as fine as the professors at Vanderbilt and there can be advantages to attendeing colleges that are less selective than Vanderbilt.  Doing a fab job at a match college can result in fine grad school choices.  We were very lucky because our state colleges in VA are outcomes that are easy to live with so our sons were prepared to stay in state, but don't neglect your match college in your affections.

He did have a 2250 on the SAT and 750 or better on all his SAT II's. I did not read his application so I can only assmume his essays were good.

As a counselor at a highly selective college I frequently field questions about standardized testing.  I noticed in recent months, though, that many students I work with don’t apply testing statistics to their college search process appropriately.  Numbers aren’t helpful if you don’t understand their reference.  Here I break down testing statistics: questions to ask to be sure you understand the numbers and how to use the numbers once you understand them.     What’s your average SAT/ACT?  The answer to the above question is not helpful to prospective students.  Why?  First off, averages are susceptible to outliers.  Take the example below:  I have 5 students and their ACT scores are as follows: 30, 30, 30, 30, and 36.  Then the ACT average is 31.2.  If I go around reporting 31.2 as the ACT average a student with a 30 ACT has very little concept of how their testing fits into the picture.  They can’t see that the single 36 is pulling the average upwards.  Furthermore, there is a human tendency to process averages as a benchmark or cutoff.  I watch it happen all the time.  If I told a room of prospective students the average ACT was 31.2 the student with the score of 30 may think they are not a competitive candidate for admission.  Because of the reasons above and others, most colleges report testing as a range. Some of my students find this frustrating, as if a testing range conceals a benchmark, but I promise you they are far more illustrative.    What’s your testing range?  If I just tell you Vanderbilt’s testing range for ACT is 30 to 34 (or 1360 to 1530 for SAT), then you need to ask follow-up questions.  First, question to ask: does that range represent applied, admitted, or enrolled students?  Testing ranges for admitted students will almost always be higher than testing ranges for enrolled students simply because the highest testers have a greater number of post-secondary options.  FYI:  The ranges above are for our enrolled Class of 2014 ; the ranges for the admitted class were 31-34 and 1440-1540.  Another question to ask is: do you superscore tests?  At Vanderbilt we superscore the SAT and we do not superscore the ACT.  Therefore, the testing ranges we report reflect the highest Critical Reading + Math (regardless of test date) for the SAT and the highest ACT Composite in a single sitting.    What does the mid-50% mean?  The vast majority of the time you see testing ranges reported, they are reporting the 25 th percentile through the 75 th percentile, or the mid-50%.  Vanderbilt example: our Class of 2014 ACT mid-50% is 30-34.  Of our 1600 freshmen, 800 of those students have scores that fall at or between a 30 and 34; 400 students scored either a 35 or 36 on the exam and 400 scored 29 or below.  Reporting with ranges is helpful because outliers have less influence.  Additionally, prospective students have a broader understanding of the entire pool with the mid-50%.    I have a 29 on the ACT, am I a competitive applicant?  The answer to that question is the dreaded ‘I don’t know’.  Ranges are instructive because they help prospective students recognize we consider a wide swath of test scores.  There is no cut-off/benchmark/requirement.  There is also no formula or weight assigned to standardized testing at Vanderbilt.  We read applications in a holistic manner , looking at every piece of the puzzle.  Therefore, I won’t know if a student with a 29 ACT is a competitive applicant until I read the other chapters to their story.  Conversely, a student possessing a 35 or 36 on the ACT may look competitive from a testing perspective, but still not receive admission due to other factors.  No, seriously, am I a competitive applicant?  We read holistically, but I’m human and I understand that the testing profile is a convenient numerical way to gauge your competitiveness as an applicant.  Here’s what I tell my students: if you’re within the mid-50% you have a good foundation to your application (but remember there are many other pieces to the puzzle).  If you have a test score above our mid-50%, you have a great foundation.  Don’t slack on the rest of the application or you may not be happy with the result; also, if you have those great scores PLUS a great application we may chase you with merit money.  Finally, if you have a test score below our mid-50%, not all hope is lost!  A quarter of our current freshman class scored below that number and they’re on campus now.  However, with that lower test score, you’ve got to shine on the rest of the application.

I am counting down the days until decisions are mailed, and your posts definitely make it easier by getting more insight into the process! Keep posting :)    David   December 10th, 2010  How much weight does the essay have in the application process?  I understand you want to hear the voice of the applicant, but what if the student failed to really choose an “interesting” topic or something that allowed them to stand out from the rest of the pool?  As long as the grammar and spelling is correct will the counselor deny an applicant based on a weaker essay?  Thank you for your response.    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  David:  There is no weight to the essay.  We have no weights at all in the process. For this reason a student can write a less-than-enthralling essay and still receive admission.  Sam, who I described in a previous post , did not have an essay topic that popped out at me, but he had amazing letters of recommendation.  The x-factor can be different for every student.    Elisa   December 10th, 2010  I have heard that some letters of acceptances will be mailed for ED1 candidates as early as today.  Can you tell me if that is occurring, or are you on track to mail every letter on December 15th, as previously posted? Thank you.    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  Elisa:  All of the letters are going out at the same time.  Right now it looks as if they will mail on either the evening of the 14th or the morning of the 15th.  They’re definitely not going out today!    David   December 10th, 2010  I had heard from several Vanderbilt students that they (in the past) received email acceptances.  Was that the case and is there any chance that we will hear online or phone, this year?    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  David: We do not release decisions via email unless the applicant is currently living outside of the United States.  Students cannot learn of their decisions via phone until December 21st.    Amber   December 10th, 2010  All this waiting is definitely making me nauseous. If it weren’t so obviously psychological I would strongly embrace the Pepto Bismol.    Sarah   December 10th, 2010  Of all of your students you have had for ED1, about how many have you accepted?    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  Sarah: We will publish these numbers at the close of Early Decision in February.    hugh   December 10th, 2010  do i still have a chance if my TOEFL is 95, which is below the minimum requirement?    Kylie   December 12th, 2010  Hugh: We will give every application a holistic review, but generally we are looking for TOEFL scores at 100 or above.    Hannah   December 11th, 2010  Thanks so much! This blog is helping me keep calm until ED1 decisions are mailed! This was also a helpful insight into what test scores really mean, how I fit into the numbers and how y’all view numbers!    Gibson   December 12th, 2010  So when should we expect our letters with our decision? On the 15th? Or later?    Christa   December 13th, 2010  Do Regular Decision applicants who turn in their apps. early find out any sooner than last-minute Regular Decisions?  Thanks!    Kylie   December 13th, 2010  Christa: No.  All RD students will receive notification according to our calendar : April 1st unless you are a scholarship recipient.    Sarah   December 19th, 2010  Hi! I hope all is well!  If I am applying for a scholarship, will the credentials I submit for the scholarship be viewed at the same time as my application for admission is reviewed? I am applying ED2, fyi.    Travis   December 29th, 2010  I heard some colleges only look at the English and math sections of the ACT.  Is this true for Vanderbilt?  My highest composite ACT score is a 30.  When I got the 30 I scored a 25 on the English section and a 35 on the math section.  However, on another test where my composite ACT score was a 29, I got a 32 on English and 34 on math.  Clearly, the english score is 7 points higher with the 29 composite score, yet 29 is a worse composite score than a 30.  Should I send my composite score of a 30 or a 29?  Please let me know! Thank you!    Kylie   December 30th, 2010  Travis:  We will consider your single highest composite score.    Robbie   January 28th, 2011  Hello! I commend all of you guys who have earned a 30 or higher on the ACT. I really wish that could be me hopefully in February. My question is, honestly, what are the number or students who have been accepted with a composite of 25? I have a low composite but I have a really good subscore of 29 in English and mid 20s in the other subtests. I also have good recommendations, rank,GPA, and essay. Do you think that I still have a chance at being accepted into Vanderbilt.    Kylie   January 28th, 2011  Robbie:  As much as I know this isn’t necessarily the answer you want- it depends.  Of our enrolled applicants who submitted ACT scores, 25% had scores lower than a 30.  Many different factors go into the application, it truly is more than just numbers.  Thus, knowing your testing doesn’t help me identify if you “have a chance”.  Know that admission is difficult for all of our applicants and I wish you the best of luck!    Christy   August 8th, 2011  In our town my daughter has the opportunity to attend a selective magnet high school or attend a typical high school that offers the “IB” diploma.  Which would be more attractive to Vanderbilt (all other things being equal). She really has her heart on being a student at Vandy! I was going to call and ask, but I stumbled across this blog and thought I might give this a shot. Thanks!    Tricia   October 25th, 2011  Do you now superscore the ACT?    Ryan Burleson   October 26th, 2011  Thanks for your question, Tricia. We don’t superscore the ACT, we just consider a student’s highest composite score. Our position is that the ACT is not as well-suited to be superscored because of the nature of the test. There is simply not as much wiggle room for the ACT since it is only based on a 36 point scale.    julie   December 20th, 2011  Just wondering how merit money or the discount rate is at your school for strong students.  My parents have no savings for college due to loss of a job a few years in the past and the three siblings that will need college after me.  But on a financial aid form their income currently is way too high for aid.  I have a strong resume of school activities, a GPA of over 4 and ACT of 31.  I am top in my school but don’t have an ACT of 36 to put me over into the extreme numbers category. What does the picture look like for a student like me.  I am beginning to think the best colleges are only for the poor and the truly wealthy,upper middle class need not apply? Julie    Carolyn Pippen   December 20th, 2011  Hi Julie,  Our need-based financial aid process if very extensive and takes into account much more than just the parents’ income (things like, I have four siblings in school, or all of our money is in assets, etc).  This is why we actually require two forms – the FAFSA and the CSS Profile – to make sure we have considered all aspects of your financial situation.  Once you have filled out these forms, we garauntee to meet 100% of your demonstrated need, loan-free.  In addition, we do have merit-based scholarships as well.  I highly encourage you to apply for both of these forms of aid, regardless of what you think your package might turn out to be. For more information feel free to visit the financial aid website ( http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/financial-aid-facts.php ) or contact our Financial Aid office at 615-322-3591.    Tootie   January 2nd, 2012  hi i graduate in 2019 and ive been researching on collages and before i decided to do this my only choices were harverd or yale to get my law degree but now you guys are in my options list! You guys rock and thanks for being their for us and hopefully i get the right SAT or ACT score to be accepted!

Mihika   December 14th, 2014  Hello, my Sat score is quite low and my score was 1640. Should i still apply to Vanderbilt University or not? What are my chances?    Jay Watson   December 15th, 2014  Hi Mihika, thanks for your question. The best resource to start with is the profile of our current students (here: http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/profile/ ). With the profile, you can see how your scores compare to our middle 50%. As we say in the post, we can’t know your chances without reviewing the rest of your application (not to mention the rest of the applicant pool). The middle 50% gives you a good starting place to evaluate your application – beyond that, it would be a good idea to speak with your admissions counselor to discuss other aspects of your application. You can find your counselor’s contact information at http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/your-counselor/ Thanks!    Grace   October 2nd, 2015  Does the fact that I have not joined one club in high school lower my chances of being accepted?    Jay Watson   October 2nd, 2015  Thanks for your question. Just as we don’t have cut-off scores for testing, we don’t have minimums for club or organization involvement. Instead, we evaluate activities outside the classroom in terms of depth of involvement, roles and responsibilities, and leadership. We want to know what you spend your time on and what you’re passionate about. That doesn’t have to be a high school club – it could be volunteer work, a business or non-profit you started or work for, some kind of artistic or athletic endeavor, or many other things. Again, thanks for your question!    Jason Knapp   January 12th, 2016  How does a high rising trend look to the committee? Example: Someone who started off with a 3.1 freshman year, 3.4 sophomore year and a 3.9 this year. Also I am a volunteer EMT, so would that help at all? Thanks!    Jay Watson   January 12th, 2016  Hi Jason, thank you for your question. A positive trend in your GPA through high school is definitely favorable. Remember that our academic evaluation takes into consideration the rigor of your curriculum – we’re not just looking for strong grades, but we also want to see that you are making those strong grades in classes that are challenging. Your experience as an EMT is also something that will be considered. If that is something you are truly passionate about, make sure that comes through in your application. Again, thanks for your question and your interest in Vanderbilt!    Connor Castleberry   February 22nd, 2016  How much is the ACT writing portion considered? I got a 35 ACT composite score but a 14 for my writing. Thank you for your response.    Jay Watson   February 29th, 2016  Thanks for your question. First, remember that standardized testing is only a part of our holistic application process. And while the writing portion of the ACT is required, the composite score is the more important factor in our process.

May I have an idea if you will consider it being a factor for lower SAT 2040?    Jay Watson   April 21st, 2016  Thanks for your question. Applicants whose native language is not English have specific admissions requirements. You should check our requirements for international students page at http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/apply/international.php     Harrison   May 3rd, 2016  How much does the score of your essay on an ACT affect the admissions process? For example, I got a 35 composite ACT score but I messed up the essay and only got an 18 on the essay. Also, I have a 750 on SAT English section. If i were to send both SAT and ACT scores, do I need to worry about the essay score or do you think the low essay score might be disregarded considering my admissions essays and high SAT English score? Thanks!    Jay Watson   May 11th, 2016  Thanks for your question, Harrison. Beginning with admission for the Class of 2021, the writing section of the ACT and the Essay section of the SAT are not required. You can also talk more thoroughly about your individual testing with your Vanderbilt admissions counselor. Thanks.    Cristina   September 6th, 2016  I have a question regarding gpa. Do you guys count the weighted gpa or unweighted gpa? Also, I volunteer at the Audobon Center, which works with environmental matters and what I want to major in is environmental science and I took AP Environmental Science and passed with a 4, would this favor me when it comes to admissions?    Jay Watson   September 20th, 2016  Hi Cristina, thanks for your questions. Regarding GPA, we evaluate based on what your high school reports on your official transcript. And, yes, we do consider your “fit” for the academic school to which you are applying, and your academic record and outside involvement are certainly considered. Again, thanks for your interest.

To see the real-time graph and calculate your chances of getting in, use this free tool from Cappex .   ​Discussion of Vanderbilt's Admissions Standards Vanderbilt is one of the most selective universities in the United States. To get in, applicants are going to need grades and standardized test scores that are well above average. In the graph above, the blue and green dots represent accepted students. As you can see, most successful Vanderbilt applicants had averages in the "A" range, SAT scores (RW+M) of about 1300 or higher, and ACT composite scores of 28 or higher. A large number of applicants had 4.0 GPAs. Clearly the higher your grades and test scores, the better your chance of an acceptance letter. Keep in mind that there are a significant number of red and yellow dots (rejected and waitlisted students) mixed in with the green and blue. Many students with grades and test scores that were on target for Vanderbilt did not get in. Note also that a few students were accepted with test scores and grades below the norm. This is because Vanderbilt, like many of the country's most selective colleges, has holistic admissions . The folks in the admissions office are interested in much more than raw numbers. Rigorous high school courses , strong extracurricular involvement , glowing letters of recommendation , and a winning application essay are all important parts of the Vanderbilt's admissions equation. Admissions Data (2016) Percent of Applicants Admitted: 11 percent Test Scores: 25th / 75th Percentile SAT Critical Reading: 700 / 790 SAT Math: 720 / 800 ACT Composite: 32 / 35 ACT English: 32 / 35 ACT Math: 30 / 35               Rejection and Waitlist Data for Vanderbilt University                 Rejection and waitlist data for Vanderbilt University.
Data courtesy of Cappex.   When we strip away the blue and green acceptance data from the scattergraph, we get a much better view of Vanderbilt's selectivity. Many students with 4.0 GPAs and high standardized test scores get rejected. No matter how strong an applicant you are, you should consider Vanderbilt a reach school . Why Does Vanderbilt Reject Strong Students? The painful reality with Vanderbilt University is that the school must reject many students who are perfectly well qualified to attend. The university attracts strong students, and with over 32,000 applicants for fewer than 2,000 positions in the incoming class, the math isn't in an applicant's favor. The school's selectivity is why applicants need to focus on more than grades and test scores. The admissions folks at Vanderbilt are looking for impressive students who are likely to contribute to the campus community in meaningful ways. An applicant's leadership experience, community service, and extracurricular accomplishments need to suggest that he or she brings value to the community.

Founded in 1873, it was named in honor of shipping and rail magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt , who provided the school its initial $1 million endowment despite having never been to the South . Vanderbilt hoped that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the Civil War . [6]  Vanderbilt enrolls approximately 12,600 students from all 50 U.S. states and over 100 foreign countries in four undergraduate and six graduate and professional schools . The university is in the process of converting its residence halls into an academic residential college system. [7] [8] Several research centers and institutes are affiliated with the university, including the Vanderbilt Institute for Public Policy Studies, Freedom Forum  First Amendment Center , and Dyer Observatory . Vanderbilt University Medical Center , formerly part of the university became a separate institution in 2016. With the exception of the off-campus observatory and the Institute, all of the university's facilities are situated on its 330-acre (1.3 km 2 ) campus in the heart of Nashville, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from downtown. Despite its urban surroundings, the campus itself is a national arboretum and features over 300 different species of trees and shrubs.  The Fugitives and Southern Agrarians were based at the university in the first half of the 20th century and helped revive Southern literature among others. [9] [10] The Jean and Alexander Heard Library , the campus library system, contains over 6.2 million items across nine libraries and stands as one of the nation's top research libraries. [11]  Vanderbilt Television News Archive holds the most extensive collection of television news coverage in the world, with over 40,000 hours of content. [12] BioVU, Vanderbilt's DNA databank, is one of the largest of its kind in the world, running over 200 ongoing projects and holding over 225,000 samples. [13] Additionally, Vanderbilt's Institute for Space and Defense Electronics , the largest of its type in the world, provides integral support to several companies, agencies, and governmental units, including Boeing , NASA , and the United States Department of Defense . [14]  Vanderbilt has many distinguished alumni, including 21 current and former members of the United States Congress , 12 governors, seven billionaires, three Nobel Prize laureates, two Vice Presidents of the United States , and a U.S. Supreme Court Justice . Other notable alumni include Rhodes Scholars , Pulitzer Prize winners, Emmy Award winners, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, heads of state and other leaders in foreign government, academics, musicians, professional athletes, and Olympians . [15] [16] [17] [18] Vanderbilt has more than 139,000 alumni, with 40 alumni clubs established worldwide. [19]  Vanderbilt is a founding member of the Southeastern Conference and has been the conference's only private school for a half-century.

[21] Following lobbying by Nashville bishop Holland Nimmons McTyeire , the author of an essay about black slavery whose father was "a cotton planter and a slaveholder" in South Carolina , [22] church leaders voted to found "The Central University of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South" in Nashville in 1872. [21] [23] However, lack of funds and the ravaged state of the Reconstruction Era South delayed the opening of the college. [21]  The following year, McTyeire stayed at the New York City residence of Cornelius Vanderbilt , whose second wife was Frank Armstrong Crawford Vanderbilt (1839–1885), a cousin of McTyeire's wife, Amelia Townsend McTyeire (1827–1891); both women were from Mobile, Alabama . [24] [25] [26] The McTyeires had met at St. Francis Street Methodist Church in Mobile. [24] Cornelius Vanderbilt, who was the wealthiest man in the United States at the time, was considering philanthropy as he was at an advanced age. He had been planning to establish a university on Staten Island , New York , in honor of his mother. [21] However, McTyeire convinced him to donate $500,000 to endow Central University in order to "contribute to strengthening the ties which should exist between all sections of our common country." [21] [27]     Memorial Hall    The endowment was eventually increased to $1 million (roughly $19,973,867 in 2015 dollars [28] ) and would be only one of two philanthropic causes financially supported by Vanderbilt. Though he never expressed any desire that the university be named after himself, [21] McTyeire and his fellow trustees rechristened the school in his honor. Vanderbilt died in 1877 without seeing the school named after him. [21] [29] They acquired land formerly owned by Texas Senator John Boyd (who chose to patronize the establishment of Trinity University , a Presbyterian university in San Antonio, Texas instead), later inherited by his granddaughter and her husband, Confederate Congressman  Henry S. Foote , who had built Old Central, a house still standing on campus. [30]  One of the founding trustees, Hezekiah William Foote , was a Confederate veteran and the owner of four plantations in Mississippi , including Mount Holly . [31] The Treasurer of the Board of Trust from 1872 to 1875, Alexander Little Page Green , whose portrait hangs in Kirkland Hall, [32] was a Methodist preacher and a former slave owner. [33] [34] His son-in-law, Robert A. Young , was a Methodist minister who served as the Financial Secretary on the Board of Trust from 1874 to 1882, retiring from the board in 1902. [35]  The first building, Main Building, later known as Kirkland Hall, was designed by William Crawford Smith , a Confederate veteran who also designed The Parthenon ; its construction began in 1874. [35] [36] In the fall of 1875, about 200 students enrolled at Vanderbilt, and in October the university was dedicated. [21] Bishop McTyeire was named Chairman of the Board of Trust for life by Vanderbilt as a stipulation of his endowment. [21] McTyeire named Landon Garland (1810–1895), his mentor from Randolph-Macon College in Virginia and then- Chancellor of the University of Mississippi , as chancellor. Garland shaped the school's structure and hired the school's faculty, many of whom were renowned scholars in their respective fields. [27] However, most of this faculty left after disputes with Bishop McTyeire, including over pay rates. [21] When the first fraternity chapter, Phi Delta Theta , was established on campus in 1876, it was shut down by the faculty, only to be reestablished as a secret society in 1877. [37] Meanwhile, Old Gym , designed by Dutch-born architect Peter J. Williamson , was built in 1879–1880. [36] By 1883, the Board of Trust passed a resolution allowing fraternities on campus, and more chapters were established in 1884. [37]  Split with the Methodist Church [ edit ]     Bishop Holland McTyeire    During the first 40 years, the Board of Trust, and therefore the university, was under the control of the General Conference (the governing body) of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South . [21] Tension grew between the university administration and the Conference over the future of the school, particularly over the methods by which members of the Vanderbilt Board of Trust would be chosen, and the extent that non-Methodists could teach at the school. [21]  Conflicts escalated after James H. Kirkland was appointed chancellor in 1893. [21] Then the Southern Methodist Church congregations raised just $50,000 in a campaign to raise $300,000. [21]  After the Tennessee Centennial Exposition of 1897, a statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt, designed by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Moretti , [38] was moved from the grounds of the Parthenon to the Vanderbilt campus. [39]  In 1905, Kirkland Hall burnt down, only to be rebuilt shortly after. [36] Meanwhile, the Board of Trust voted to limit Methodist representation on the board to just five bishops. [21] Former faculty member and bishop Elijah Hoss led a group attempting to assert Methodist control. [21] In 1910, the board refused to seat three Methodist bishops. [21] The Methodist Church took the issue to court and won at the local level. On March 21, 1914, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that the Commodore, and not the Methodist Church, was the university's founder and that the board could therefore seat whomever it wished. [21] The General Conference in 1914 voted 151 to 140 to sever its ties with Vanderbilt; it also voted to establish a new university, Southern Methodist University , and to greatly expand Emory University . [21] [40]  Colonel Edmund William Cole , the treasurer of the board of trust, was a Confederate veteran and a railroad executive. [41] [42] He is the namesake of the annual Cole Lecture; his marble bust and his wife's portrait can be seen in Kirkland Hall. [42] [43] His son, Whitefoord Russell Cole , who was the chairman of the board of trust from 1915 to 1934, defended chancellor Kirkland's decision to split with the Methodist Church. [44] [45] His portrait hangs in Kirkland Hall, and he is the namesake of Cole Hall, completed in 1949. [45]      Main Campus, looking toward West End Avenue    1920s through World War II [ edit ]  In the 1920s and 1930s, Vanderbilt University hosted two partly overlapping groups of scholars who had a large impact on American thought and letters: the Fugitives and the Agrarians . [21] Meanwhile, Frank C. Rand , who served as the President and later Chairman of the International Shoe Company , donated US$150,000 to the university in 1925; [46] Rand Hall was subsequently named for him.  In 1933, the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated $50,000 (roughly $925,166 in 2015 dollars [28] ) for the construction of Confederate Memorial Hall , designed by architect Henry C. Hibbs . [47] It was completed in 1935. [47]  In the 1930s, Ernest William Goodpasture and his colleagues in the School of Medicine invented methods for cultivating viruses and rickettsiae in fertilized chicken eggs. [48] This work made possible the production of vaccines against chicken pox , smallpox , yellow fever , typhus , Rocky mountain spotted fever and other diseases caused by agents that only propagate in living cells. [48]  Alfred Blalock , Professor of Surgery, and his assistant Vivian Thomas identified a decrease in blood volume and fluid loss outside the vascular bed as a key factor in traumatic shock and pioneered the use of replacement fluids for its treatment. [49] This treatment saved countless lives in World War II , [49] during which Vanderbilt was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. [50]  Shortly after the war, from 1945 to 1947, researchers at Vanderbilt University conducted an experiment funded by the Rockefeller Foundation where they gave 800 pregnant women radioactive iron [51] [52] [53] without their consent. [52] [53] In a lawsuit the women received US$9.1 million from Vanderbilt University and US$900,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1998. [52]  1950s and 1960s [ edit ]     Old Mechanical, now part of The Owen Graduate School of Management    In 1953, the School of Religion admitted the first African-American student to the university. [54] In 1960, the School of Religion expelled a student who was one of the leaders of the emerging civil rights movement, James Lawson . [55]  James Geddes Stahlman , a Vanderbilt trustee who owned the Nashville Banner , published misleading stories which suggested Lawson had incited others to "violate the law" and led to his expulsion. [55] Dean J. Robert Nelson resigned in protest. [56] Nevertheless, Chancellor Harvie Branscomb enforced the decision, and remained unapologetic as late as 1980. [55] The school was placed on probation for a year by the American Association of Theological Schools , and the power of trustees was curtailed. [55] The university took Stahlman's $5 million donation in 1972-1973, [57] and named a professorship in his honor. [58] In 2005, Lawson was re-hired as a Distinguished University Professor for the 2006–2007 academic year, and named a Distinguished Alumnus for his achievements. [59]  The Vanderbilt Board of Trust in May 1962 voted to accept African Americans in all schools, and the first black undergraduates entered the school in the fall of 1964. [54] The university drew national attention in 1966 when it recruited Perry Wallace , the first African American to play varsity basketball in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). [60] Wallace, from Nashville, played varsity basketball for Vanderbilt from 1967 to 1970, and faced considerable opposition from segregationists when playing at other SEC venues. [61] In 2004, a student-led drive to retire Wallace's jersey finally succeeded. [61] [a]  1970s to present [ edit ]     Vanderbilt University police car.    In 1979, Vanderbilt acquired Peabody College , then called the "George Peabody College for Teachers", residing on 53 acres adjacent to the university. [65] In the early 1980s, Vanderbilt University was a financial backer of the Corrections Corporation of America prior to its IPO. [66] [67]  In 2001, the university determined to remodel the undergraduate experience by creating an academic residential college system. Since then Vanderbilt has been constructing new buildings and renovating existing structures to support the college system. [68] [69]  In 2002, the university decided to rename Confederate Memorial Hall, a residence hall on the Peabody campus to Memorial Hall. [70] Nationwide attention resulted, in part due to a lawsuit by the Tennessee chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. [71] The Davidson County Chancery Court dismissed the lawsuit in 2003, but the Tennessee Court of Appeals ruled in May 2005 that the university must pay damages based on the present value of the United Daughters of the Confederacy's contribution if the inscription bearing the name "Confederate Memorial Hall" was removed from the building or altered. [72] The Court of Appeals' decision has been critiqued by legal scholars. [73] In late July 2005, the university announced that although it had officially renamed the building, and all university publications and offices will refer to it solely as Memorial Hall , the university would neither appeal the matter further, nor remove the inscription and pay damages. [74] In August 2016, the university agreed to remove the word "Confederate" from the building after "anonymous donors" donated $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy. [75]  In 2009, Vanderbilt instituted a no-loan policy. The policy states that any student granted admission and a need-based aid package will have an award that includes no student loans. [76] Following this, in 2015, Vanderbilt implemented Opportunity Vanderbilt, which committed the University to need-blind admissions, meeting 100% of demonstrated financial need of admitted students, and including only grants in awards. [77]  In 2011, the Oakland Institute exposed a university investment in EMVest Asset Management , a private equity firm "accused of ' land grabbing ,' or taking over agricultural land used by local communities through exploitative practices for large-scale commercial export farming in five sub-Saharan African countries. [78] The revelation led to student protests in 2012. [78] [79] By 2013, Vanderbilt administrators had divested from EMVest. [78]  In 2015, Vanderbilt opened a new innovation center, the Wond'ry, as part of its Academic Strategic Plan. [80] The three-story, 13,000-square foot building is meant to serve as an interdisciplinary hub of knowledge for the Vanderbilt community, serving as the location of hackathons, partnerships with the Nashville Entrepreneurship Center, and several social venture programs. [81]  Organization and administration [ edit ]    College/school   Year founded     Arts and Science   1873     Law   1874     Medicine   1874     Divinity   1875     Education and Human Development   1875, incorporated into Vanderbilt 1979     Graduate School   1879     Engineering   1886     Nursing   1908     Music   1964, incorporated into Vanderbilt 1986     Management   1969     Vanderbilt University, as a private corporation, is wholly governed by an independent, self-perpetuating Board of Trust. The board comprises 45 regular members (plus any number of trustees emeriti) and the chancellor, the university's chief executive officer . [82] Each trustee serves a five-year term (except for four recently graduated alumni, who serve two two-year terms). Bruce R. Evans is the board's chairman . [83]  Nicholas S. Zeppos currently serves as chancellor of Vanderbilt University. He was appointed interim chancellor after the departure of Gordon Gee , who left to reassume the presidency of Ohio State University on August 1, 2007, [84] and was named chancellor in his own right on March 1, 2008. [85]  Administration history [ edit ]  Since the opening of the university in 1875, only eight individuals have served as chancellors. [86] Landon Garland was the university's first chancellor, serving from 1875 to 1893. [86] Garland organized the university and hired its first faculty. Garland Hall, an academic building on campus, is named in his honor. [86]  The next chancellor was James Kirkland —serving from 1893 to 1937, he had the longest tenure of any Vanderbilt chancellor. [86] He was responsible for severing the university's ties with the Methodist Church and relocating the medical school to the main campus. [86] Vanderbilt's Main Building was renamed Kirkland Hall after Kirkland left in 1937. [86]  The longest-tenured chancellor was followed by one of the shortest-tenured. [86]  Oliver Carmichael served Vanderbilt for just nine years, 1937 to 1946. [86] Carmichael developed the graduate school, and established the Joint University Libraries for Vanderbilt, Peabody, and Scarritt College. [86] Carmichael Towers, a set of high-rise dormitories on the northern edge of campus, were named for Chancellor Carmichael. [86]  Carmichael's successor was Harvie Branscomb . [86] Branscomb presided over a period of major growth and improvement at the university that lasted from 1946 until 1963. [86] He was responsible for opening the admissions policy to all races. [86] Branscomb Quadrangle is a residence hall complex named for the chancellor. [86]  Alexander Heard , for whom the campus's 10-library system (with 3.3 million total volumes) is named, served as chancellor from 1963 to 1982. [86] During his 20-year tenure, the Owen Graduate School of Management was founded, and Vanderbilt's merger with Peabody College was negotiated. [86] He also survived calls for his ouster because of his accommodating stance on desegregation. [86]     After a fire, Old Main hall was rebuilt with one tower and renamed Kirkland Hall. It is currently home to Vanderbilt's administration.    Joe B. Wyatt was the chancellor who served immediately after Heard, from 1982 until 2000. [86] Wyatt oversaw a great increase in the university's endowment, an increase in student diversity, and the renovation of many campus buildings. [86] Wyatt placed great emphasis on improving the quality of faculty and instruction, and during his tenure Vanderbilt rose to the top 25 in the U.S. News & World Report' s annual rankings for the first time. [87] The Wyatt Center on Peabody's campus is named for Wyatt and his wife.  Gee was appointed chancellor by the Board of Trust in February 2000. [86] After allegations of lavish spending in 2005, the Board of Trust established a committee to monitor his personal spending more closely. [88]  After Gordon Gee's departure in 2007, Zeppos was named interim chancellor. [89] He was named chancellor suo jure on March 1, 2008, by the university's Board of Trust. [90]  Medical Center [ edit ]  Until April 2016 Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) was a component of the university, but is now an independent organization. The Medical Center continues to cooperate with the university and many clinical staff serve as faculty members at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and Vanderbilt University School of Nursing . [91] As of April 2016, VUMC comprised the following units: Vanderbilt University Hospital, Monroe Carell, Jr., Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital, Vanderbilt Clinic, Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center, Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Hospital, Eskind Biomedical Library, Vanderbilt Sports Medicine, Dayani Human Performance Center, Vanderbilt Page Campbell and Heart Institute. [92]     The entrance of Vanderbilt Medical School    Before splitting with VUMC, Vanderbilt was the largest private employer in Middle Tennessee and the second largest in the state with over 23,000 employees. [93] [94] Approximately 74% of the university's faculty and staff were employed by the Medical Center. [6] In 2008, the medical center was placed on the Honor Roll of U.S. News & World Report' s annual rating of the nation's best hospitals, ranking 15th overall in the country. [95]  Students and faculty [ edit ]  Profile [ edit ]     Benson Science Hall, one of the first campus buildings, houses the English and history departments.    As of 2017, Vanderbilt had an enrollment of 6,885 undergraduate and 5,707 graduate and professional students, for a total of 12,592 students. [4] Students from all 50 states and more than 100 countries attend Vanderbilt, with 65% of the total student body coming from outside the South and 8% from outside of the United States. [4] Moreover, 47.4% of the class of 2021 classified as Caucasian, 10.4% Hispanic/Latino, 10.7% Black or African American, 14.1% Asian, and 5.3% other/two or more races; 7.6% of the class is international. [11] As of 2017, the incoming class was 49% male and 51% female [4] In 2017, Vanderbilt accepted 10.9% of its 31,462 freshman applicants, making it one of the most selective universities in the country. [96]  Vanderbilt lets undergraduates choose between 70 majors , or create their own, in its four undergraduate schools and colleges: the College of Arts and Science , the School of Engineering , Peabody College of Education and Human Development , and Blair School of Music . [6] The university also has six graduate and professional schools, including the Divinity School , Graduate School , Law School , School of Medicine , School of Nursing , and Owen Graduate School of Management . [6] As of 2018, Vanderbilt has a student-to-faculty ratio of 7:1. [19]  The university's undergraduate programs are highly selective: in 2018, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions accepted 7.3% of its 30,146 Regular Decision applicants, thus making Vanderbilt one of the most selective universities in the United States and the most selective university in the state of Tennessee. [97] [98] In 2015, Vanderbilt was ranked fifth overall and fourth among private universities in enrollment of National Merit Scholars, according to the National Merit Scholarship Corporation's annual report. [99] In its most recent annual comparison of admissions selectivity, The Princeton Review gave Vanderbilt a rating of 99 out of 99. [100] The class of 2021 included 226 National Merit Scholars and had standardized test scores that were well above average: the interquartile range (25th percentile – 75th percentile) of SAT scores was 700-760 for Reading and Writing and 700-790 for Math, while the interquartile range of ACT scores was 32–35. [101] For students of the class of 2016 whose schools reported exact class rankings, 96.21% ranked in the top 10% of their class, with an average rank of 3.39%. [102]  Research [ edit ]  Vanderbilt investigators work in a broad range of disciplines, and the university consistently ranks among the top 20 research institutions in the United States. [103] [104] In 2013, Vanderbilt University was ranked 9th in the country in funding from the National Institutes of Health. [105] Its Institute for Space and Defense Electronics , housed in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, includes the largest academic facility in the world involved in radiation-effects research. [106]     Peabody Library, Vanderbilt University    Among its more unusual activities, the university has institutes devoted to the study of coffee and of bridge . [107] Indeed, the modern form of the latter was developed by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt , a former president of the university's Board of Trust and a great-grandson of the Commodore. [107] In addition, in mid-2004 it was announced that Vanderbilt's chemical biology research may have serendipitously opened the door to the breeding of a blue rose , something that has long been coveted by horticulturalists and rose lovers. [108]  Vanderbilt scholars have played a role in the development of writing. The Fugitives and Southern Agrarians were based at the university in the first half of the 20th century and helped revive Southern literature among others. [109] [110]  Vanderbilt's research record is blemished, however, by a study university researchers, in conjunction with the Tennessee Department of Health, conducted on iron  metabolism during pregnancy in the 1940s. [111] Between 1945 and 1949, over 800 pregnant women were given radioactive iron. Standards of informed consent for research subjects were not rigorously enforced at that time, [b] and many of the women were not informed of the potential risks. The injections were later suspected to have caused cancer in at least three of the children who were born to these mothers. [112] In 1998, the university settled a class action lawsuit with the mothers and surviving children for $10.3 million. [113]  The university is classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a Doctoral University with Highest Research Activity . [114] The university has a comprehensive graduate program, offering doctoral programs in sciences, engineering, mathematics, humanities, social sciences, and religion, along with professional degrees in medicine, business, law, nursing, and education. [115]  Vanderbilt is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium. Now renamed the SECU, the initiative was a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship, and achievement among the member universities in the Southeastern Conference. The SECU's goals include highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC faculty, students, and universities and advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities. [116] [117]  In 2013, Vanderbilt University participated in the SEC Symposium in Atlanta, Georgia , which was organized and led by the University of Georgia and its Bioenergy Systems Research Institute. The topic of the symposium was titled "The Impact of the Southeast in the World's Renewable Energy Future". [118]  Rankings [ edit ]  Vanderbilt is ranked the 108th best university in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings , [119] and 52nd in the United States by the Academic Ranking of World Universities . [120]  U.S. News & World Report ranks it the 14th best university nationally, [121] and Reuters ranked it the 10th most innovative university in the world.

In its 2018 edition, U.S. News & World Report ranked Vanderbilt 14th among all national universities. [134] In the same publication's graduate program rankings, the Peabody College of Education was ranked third in the nation among schools of education, [135] and the Vanderbilt Law School was listed at 16th, the School of Medicine was listed at 15th among research-oriented medical schools , the School of Nursing was listed at 15th, the School of Engineering was listed at 34th, and the Owen Graduate School of Management was listed at 25th among business schools. [136] Additionally, U.S. News & World Report ranked Vanderbilt first in the nation in the fields of special education , educational administration, and audiology . [136] In 2014, the Owen Graduate School of Management was ranked 30th by Bloomberg Businessweek among full-time MBA programs. [137]  The Academic Ranking of World Universities ranks Vanderbilt as the 60th-best university in the world. Additionally the ARWU Field rankings in 2015 placed Vanderbilt as 18th best in the world for Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy, and 21st in Social Sciences. [138] In the Times Higher Education 2016 World University Rankings, Vanderbilt is 87th. The 2017/2018 QS World University Rankings ranked Vanderbilt 212th in the world. Human Resources & Labor Review , a national human competitiveness index & analysis, ranked the university as one of 50 Best World Universities in 2011. [139] The 2007 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index , a measure of the scholarly output of the faculty of nearly 7,300 doctoral programs around the United States, ranked Vanderbilt 8th among large research universities, and 1st in the areas of comparative literature , educational leadership , pharmacology , Portuguese , Spanish , and special education. [140]  Poets & Writers ranked Vanderbilt's English Department's MFA Program in Creative Writing 18th among the top 50 writing programs in the United States in 2010 and 14th in the United States in 2011. [141]  Fortune magazine ranked Vanderbilt among the top 100 places to work in the United States, the only university on their list [142] In 2017, Money ranked Vanderbilt the 15th best college in the nation among national universities, liberal arts colleges, and service academies [143] In 2018, Kiplinger's listed Vanderbilt as one of the top five private universities in value and one of the top ten overall. [144] In 2016, the university was listed by Travel + Leisure as having one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. [145] In 2018, Niche ranked Vanderbilt the ninth hardest university to get into in America. [146] Additionally, Vanderbilt was the only university in the top 15 on both their Best Greek life and Best Colleges rankings. [147] [148]  Vanderbilt does well in non-academic rankings as well. In 2017 alone, the university was ranked #1 for happiest students, #2 for quality of life, #5 for most beautiful campus, and #5 for best-run college according to Princeton Review. [149]  In 2016, Vanderbilt was ranked the third most intense college in the nation by Business Insider . [150]  Campus layout [ edit ]     Vanderbilt's campus is a designated national arboretum.    The Vanderbilt campus is located approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) southwest of downtown in the West End neighborhood of midtown Nashville. It has an area of 330 acres (1.3 km 2 ), though this figure includes large tracts of sparsely used land in the southwest part of the main campus, as well as the Medical Center. [151] The historical core of campus encompasses approximately 75 acres (0.3 km 2 ). [152]  The oldest part of the Vanderbilt campus is known for its abundance of trees and green space, which stand in contrast to the surrounding cityscape of urban Nashville. [153] The campus was designated as a national arboretum in 1988 by the Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta, and approximately 190 species of trees and shrubs can be found on campus. [153] One tree, the Bicentennial Oak between Rand Hall and Garland Hall, is certified to have lived during the American Revolution and is the oldest living thing on the campus. [153] In December 2015, a hackberry tree fell, leaving 10 students injured with "broken bones and stitches." [154] [155]  Main campus [ edit ]     Bicentennial Oak, facing Buttrick Hall, predates the Revolutionary War.    In the northeast corner of the campus (the base of the fan) is the original campus. [156] This section stretches from West End Avenue south to the Stevenson Center and west from 21st Avenue to Alumni Lawn. The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments of the College of Arts and Science, as well as the facilities of the Law School, Owen Graduate School of Management, and the Divinity School, are located in the original campus. Additionally, the Heard Central Library and Sarratt Student Center/Rand Hall can be found on the original campus. [156]  Flanking the original campus to the south are the Stevenson Center for Science and Mathematics—built on a woodland once known as the Sacred Grove [157] —and the School of Engineering complex (Jacobs Hall-Featheringill Hall). Housing the Science Library, the School of Engineering, and all the science and math departments of the College of Arts and Science, this complex sits between the original campus and the Medical Center. [156] The Vanderbilt University Medical Center itself takes up the southeastern part of the campus. [156] Besides the various associated hospitals and clinics and the facilities of the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, the medical center also houses many major research facilities.  West of the original campus and the Medical Center, Greek Row and the bulk of the Vanderbilt residence halls are found. [156] From north to south, Carmichael Towers, Greek Row, Branscomb Quadrangle, and Highland Quadrangle house the vast majority of on-campus residents in facilities ranging from the double-occupancy, shared-bathroom dorms in Branscomb and Towers to the apartments and lodges in Highland Quadrangle. [156]  The design of the campus and buildings can be described as eclectic, with buildings of various styles and eras. The original 75 acre campus included 11 structures situated along ridge lines with sprawling views of downtown Nashville. The campus gates were located off Vanderbilt Avenue (later to become 21st Avenue). Currently four of the original eleven campus structures still exist. In recent years campus planners have strived to preserve the landscape and buildings of the original core and maintain a compact, walkable campus. [158]     The Wyatt Center on Vanderbilt's Peabody campus    Memorial Gymnasium , Vanderbilt Stadium , Hawkins Field , McGugin Center, and all the other varsity athletic fields and facilities are to be found in the extreme west of campus. [156] The Student Recreation Center and its associated intramural fields are located south of the varsity facilities. [156]  Peabody campus [ edit ]  Directly across 21st Avenue from the Medical Center sits the campus of the Peabody College of Education and Human Development. [156] The design of the Peabody campus was inspired by the classical lines of Thomas Jefferson ’s design for the University of Virginia and the architecture of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois . The National Historic Landmarks program designated the central lawn and surrounding buildings as a historic district in 1965. [159] The Peabody campus is the location of the Martha Rivers Ingram Commons freshman residences.  Student life [ edit ]  Residential college system [ edit ]     Kissam Hall was a men's dormitory from 1901 until it was demolished in 1958. The baths were all in the basement.    In the early 2000s Vanderbilt made a decision to convert its residence halls into an academic residential college system. [68] [7] The intent is to form "a cohesive and growing network of residences that spark creativity, build community, support student success, and extend educational opportunities beyond the classroom." [8] The first phase of this conversion was opening in 2008 of The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons, which brought together all first-year students in 10 adjacent houses, each house guided by a faculty head of house, living among the students in a faculty apartment. It is planned that in their sophomore year, students will enter a Residential College that will be their home for the remainder of their undergraduate years. This residential option expands on the experience provided during students' first year on The Commons. The first two upperclass colleges are Warren College and Moore College, which opened in 2014. [8] They were constructed on the site of pre-existing dormitories known as the Kissam Quadrangle [160] E. Bronson Ingram College, on the site of the former Vanderbilt and Barnard Halls, is planned to open for occupancy in Fall of 2018. [8] [69] Additional colleges are being constructed at the site of Carmichael Towers so that all upperclass students will reside in college. [8] [69] The new College Halls are intended to complement the earlier communities, The McGill Project, Mayfield Lodges, and McTyeire International House. [8]  Two of the new residence halls have received LEED silver certification and the new Commons Dining Center has received gold certification, making Vanderbilt the only university in the state to be recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council . [161] [162] The university expects all five of the new residence halls and one renovated residence hall to eventually receive LEED recognition. [163] The total cost of The Commons construction project is expected to be over $150 million. [164]  Generally, undergraduate students are required to live in dorms on campus, with first-year students all living in the ten resident halls of The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons and all upperclassmen living on the main campus. [165] Exceptions are made for students living with relatives in Davidson County , students with health exemptions, married students, and some students with senior standing. [165]     The Commons Center dining hall    Organizations [ edit ]  The university has many student organizations, ranging from academic major societies and honoraries to recreational sports clubs, the oldest of which is the Vanderbilt Sailing Club. [166]     Sailing Club Regatta    One publication, The Vanderbilt Hustler , was established in 1888 and is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Nashville. [167] In Langford v. Vanderbilt University (1956), a student sued the university for libel; [168] the Tennessee court dismissed the lawsuit, concluding the university was not the owner of the newspaper. [169] Additional student publications include those published by the College of Arts & Science, such as the Vanderbilt Political Review and the Vanderbilt Historical Review , as well as the Vanderbilt University Law School, which publishes three law reviews ; the flagship journal is the Vanderbilt Law Review . The on-campus radio station, WRVU , represents the student body by playing a range of music from bluegrass to choral, with a focus on non-mainstream music. [170]      Occupy Vanderbilt encampment, March 2012.    Vanderbilt also has a large performing arts community spanning every genre of the arts with multiple organizations representing each category. There are dance groups covering contemporary, tap, hip hop, Latin, and Bhangra styles as well as numerous theatre, improvisation, spoken word, music and singing groups including the 2014 Sing-Off champion male a cappella group, The Melodores. [171] Performing arts organizations comprise over 1,000 students and are represented by the Vanderbilt Performing Arts Community, which supports groups by sponsoring performances and awards. [172]  In 2012, students took part in the Occupy movement on campus. They pitched tents outside Kirkland Hall.  In 2016, students took part in the Sanctuary Campus movement, calling on Vanderbilt not to take part in mass deportations or Muslim registries. The administration eventually complied with such demands.  The student body is governed by Vanderbilt Student Government, which includes Senate, Judicial, and Executive Branches. This organization is responsible for the distribution of nearly $2 million in funds set aside by the university to fund student organizations. The VSG passed a bill in 2017 calling on Vanderbilt to divest from private prisons.  Greek life [ edit ]  The university is home to 17 fraternities and 15 sororities as of Spring 2018. [173] As of 2016–2017, 34% of men were members of fraternities and 50% of women were members of sororities, or 42% of the total undergraduate population. [174]  Honor code [ edit ]  Vanderbilt students are required to sign an Honor Code, agreeing to conform to a certain set of behaviors. [175] [176] The honor code dates to 1875. [175] The Honor Committee, later renamed the Honor Council, was created in 1900. [175] The Honor Council comprises a student executive board and representatives from each class year; it enforces the Honor Code and informs members of the Vanderbilt community about the Honor System. [177] Violations can lead to discipline or expulsion from the university. [178] In 2009, a student sued the university over his expulsion. [178]  Dean of Students Madison Sarratt explained the honor code:   Today I am going to give you two examinations, one in trigonometry and one in honesty. I hope you will pass them both, but if you must fail one, let it be trigonometry, for there are many good men in this world today who cannot pass an examination in trigonometry, but there are no good men in the world who cannot pass an examination in honesty. [179]   Student controversies [ edit ]  On November 4, 2010, two anonymous former members of the Vanderbilt chapter, an alumnus and a senior student, alleged they were evicted from Beta Upsilon Chi , a Christian fraternity , for being gay. [180] [181] [182] [183]  In the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2011, four Christian student organizations were placed on probation due to non-compliance with the university's nondiscrimination policy, which requires student groups to accept all students and forbids them from requiring that their officers share the "beliefs, goals and values" embodied in the group. [184] Controversy continued to surround this issue throughout 2011 and 2012, culminating in a proposed state law exempting student organizations from nondiscrimination policies. Although the bill passed both houses of the Tennessee Legislature , it was vetoed by Governor Bill Haslam . [185]  In March 2015, three swastikas , a symbol of Nazi  antisemitism , were found spray-painted in the elevator and basement inside the house of Alpha Epsilon Pi , one of the historically Jewish fraternities on campus. [186] [187] [188] The campus Hillel chapter called it "a malicious attack intended to bring to mind the horrors of the Holocaust , to force us to feel different, endangered and isolated." [189] The news, characterized as a " hate crime " by university officials, made national and international headlines, including in Israel. [186] [187] [188]  A 2015 survey reported that 20% of undergraduate students were sexually assaulted in 2014–2015. [190] Meanwhile, as of 2015, The Tennessean reports that the university is "under review by federal education officials, spurred by six current and former female students who filed a complaint about how Vanderbilt has handled cases of sexual misconduct." [190]  In April 2016 and June 2016, two former Vanderbilt football players were found guilty of charges related to the videotaped rape of an unconscious woman in a dorm room. [191] Cory Batey was convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual battery, facilitation of aggravated rape, and attempted aggravated rape, [192] while Brandon Vandenburg was convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual battery, and unlawful photography. [191] [193] The two are among four former football players charged with crimes related to the case. [194]  Athletics [ edit ]  Main article: Vanderbilt Commodores     Vanderbilt's basketball teams play in Memorial Gymnasium.    Vanderbilt is a charter member of the Southeastern Conference and for a half-century has been the conference's only private school. [195] The university fields six men's and nine women's intercollegiate teams. [196] [197] With fewer than 6,900 undergraduates, the school is also the smallest in the conference; the SEC's next-smallest school, the University of Mississippi , has nearly twice as many undergraduate students. Additionally, the school has outside conference memberships in two women's sports that the SEC does not sponsor. The women's lacrosse team plays in the Big East Conference through the 2018 season, after which that team will move to the American Athletic Conference . [198] In bowling , a sport which the NCAA sanctions only for women, Vanderbilt is a member of the single-sport Southland Bowling League . [199] Conversely, Vanderbilt is the only SEC school not to field teams in softball and volleyball , but has discussed adding either or both sports in the future. [200]  Men's and women's tennis and men's and women's basketball are traditionally Vanderbilt's strongest sports. Both basketball teams play in quirky Memorial Gym , built in 1952. [201] The homecourt advantage Vanderbilt has enjoyed has been nicknamed "Memorial Magic". [202] The women's tennis team won the NCAA national championship in 2015.  In February 2016, the university was fined $100,000 by the Southeastern Conference after fans stormed the basketball court following a win. [203]  Athletics restructuring [ edit ]     Hawkins Field in June 2007    The university is unique in NCAA Division I in that for several years the athletics department was not administered separately from other aspects of campus life; Vice Chancellor David Williams, who was over intercollegiate athletics, also was university counsel and in charge of other aspects of undergraduate campus life such as intramural sports. [204] Despite fears that Vanderbilt would lose coaches and recruits or would be forced out of the SEC, the university experienced considerable success after the change; 2006–07 was one of the best in the school's athletic history. At one point, seven of Vanderbilt's 16 teams were concurrently ranked in the Top 25 of their respective sports. [205] Women's bowling won the NCAA championship, bringing the university its first team championship since the advent of the NCAA. [206] The baseball team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004, had the nation's top recruiting class in 2005 according to Baseball America , [207] made the NCAA field again in 2006, and won the 2007 SEC regular-season and tournament championships and won the NCAA college world series in 2014 (the university's only men's NCAA national championship). Vanderbilt was ranked first in most polls for a large portion of the 2007 season, and the team secured the top seed in the 2007 NCAA tournament . [208] However, following the departure of former Chancellor Gordon Gee to return to Ohio State University , the experiment was phased out and Williams has officially been given the formal title of athletic director and slowly relieved of his other responsibilities in order to allow him to concentrate on this role on a full-time basis. [ citation needed ]  Mascot [ edit ]  Vanderbilt's intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the Commodores, in honor of the nickname given to Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune in shipping. [209] The term commodore was used by the Navy during the mid-to-late 19th century. A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. The rank is still used by the British Royal Navy and other Commonwealth countries, but the equivalent modern-day rank in the U.S. Navy is rear admiral lower half . Since the term was used most during the 19th century, Vanderbilt's mascot, "Mr. C", is usually portrayed as a naval officer from the late 19th century, complete with mutton chops , cutlass , and uniform.  In addition to Mr. C, Vanderbilt fans often use the cheer "Anchor down!" accompanied by the "VU" hand sign, created by extending the thumb along with the index and middle fingers (essentially identical to the Serbian three-finger salute ). [210]  Notable faculty and alumni [ edit ]  Main article: List of Vanderbilt University people  Public service [ edit ]  Many Vanderbilt alumni have gone on to make significant contributions in politics. Lamar Alexander ( B.A. 1962) is a current U.S. Senator, former Governor of Tennessee , former U.S. Secretary of Education , and former U.S. presidential candidate; he filled the Senate seat left vacant by the retirement of Fred Thompson (J.D. 1971). [211] There has been at least one Vanderbilt graduate occupying a U.S. Senate seat for Tennessee since 1977. Other alumni who are current members of Congress include John Neely Kennedy (B.A. 1973), a Senator from Louisiana ; French Hill (B.S. 1978), a Representative from Arkansas ; Luke Messer (J.D. 1994), a Representative from Indiana ; Leonard Lance (J.D. 1977), a Representative from New Jersey ; and Steve Cohen (B.A. 1971), a Representative from Tennessee. Additionally, Greg Abbott , the 48th and current Governor of Texas , received his law degree from Vanderbilt in 1984. Two U.S. vice presidents , John Nance Garner and Al Gore , attended the university, but did not graduate. [212] [213] However, Gore's ex-wife, Tipper , is herself an alumna, receiving a master's degree from Peabody in 1975. [214] In total, Vanderbilt has graduated 12 current and former governors and 21 current and former Congressmen. Other alumni who are or have been involved in politics include former United States Supreme Court Associate Justice and former Attorney General  James Clark McReynolds (B.S. 1882), Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute  David Boaz (B.A. 1975), [211] [215]  White House Chief of Staff  John R. Steelman (M.A. 1924), Civil Rights Movement activist James Lawson (M.Div. 1960), and U.S. Secretary of Commerce  Mickey Kantor (B.A. 1951). [216] [217]  Allan Hubbard (B.A. 1969) is a former Director of the National Economic Council . [218]  William Hagerty (B.A. 1981, J.D. 1984) is the current U.S. Ambassador to Japan . [219]  Bill Frist , a cardiothoracic surgeon and former U.S. Senate Majority Leader , is a faculty member at Vanderbilt University Medical Center .

Harlan (M.S. 1948) won the 1984 Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize in both 1973 and 1984. [240] Two well-known sportswriters, Grantland Rice (B.A. 1901) and Fred Russell (B.A. 1927), have a scholarship named after them at the university, [241] and Buster Olney (B.A. 1988) writes for ESPN.com and The New York Times .

Martin is often overlooked as an SEC integration pioneer because his first season of 1966 was Tulane's last as an SEC member. [62]  At the same time that Wallace and another African-American basketball player, Godfrey Dillard (who transferred from Vanderbilt before playing in a varsity game), [63] enrolled as scholarship athletes at Vanderbilt, the University of Kentucky enrolled two African-American scholarship football players, Nate Northington and Greg Page. Since freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports at the time, players who enrolled in school in 1966 could not play on varsity teams until 1967. Because the football season precedes the basketball season within the school year, both were set to become the first African-American scholarship athletes in the SEC, but Page suffered a paralyzing spinal cord injury in a 1967 preseason practice and died from the complications on September 29, the night before Northington became the SEC's first black scholarship athlete when he played his first (and ultimately only) game for Kentucky .

An ancient tropical sea created Nashville’s extraordinary limestone landscape. From that limestone, Civil War military engineers created the nation’s largest inland masonry fortification. Fossils at the Fort provides a rare opportunity to make vital connections between ancient times and the more recent past.” #vandygram #nashville https://ift.tt/2JpcE7O    Posted on Thursday, April 5th 2018  Tags  IFTTT  Instagram      4 days ago  1 note             Students, faculty and staff gathered Wednesday evening to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They formed a unity circle and shared a moment of silence at 6:01 p.m., the time of the shooting on April 4, 1968, then joined in a nationwide ringing of bells 39 times to mark each year of King’s life. #vandygram #mlk50 https://ift.tt/2EmmnHW    Posted on Thursday, April 5th 2018  Tags  IFTTT  Instagram      5 days ago  0 notes             Class trip of a lifetime: Professor Dan Morgan and undergraduate Andrew Grant went to Antarctica in search of the oldest ice ever found.

Before the event, he joined me to record the latest edition of The Zeppos Report podcast. We discuss the changing dynamics of American politics over the past decades and the pendulum effect that often takes place in election cycles. Matthews describes each change in the presidency as a reaction to what came before. To him, the election of Donald Trump is no different. _________ Listen at vanderbilt.edu. #vandygram https://ift.tt/2Eedz6V    Posted on Monday, April 2nd 2018  Tags  IFTTT  Instagram      1 week ago  1 note             From 3D printing to state-of-the-art drug development, #research at Vanderbilt cultivates many advancements in #technology.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into Vanderbilt and build a strong application.  School location: Nashville, TN  This school is also known as: Vanderbilt University, Vandy       Admissions Rate: 12%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at Vanderbilt is 12% . For every 100 applicants, only 12 are admitted.    This means the school is extremely selective . Meeting their GPA requirements and SAT/ACT requirements is very important to getting past their first round of filters and proving your academic preparation. If you don't meet their expectations, your chance of getting is nearly zero. After crossing this hurdle, you'll need to impress Vanderbilt application readers through their other application requirements, including extracurriculars, essays, and letters of recommendation. We'll cover more below.   Vanderbilt GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.8   The average GPA at Vanderbilt is 3.8 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 3.8, Vanderbilt
	  
	  requires you to be near the top of your class , and well above average. Your transcript should show mostly A's. Ideally, you will also have taken several AP or IB classes to show that you can handle academics at a college level.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.8, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to Vanderbilt. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. Vanderbilt SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1530 (Old: 2240)   The average SAT score composite at Vanderbilt is a 1530 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 2240 .  This score makes Vanderbilt Extremely Competitive for SAT test scores.    Vanderbilt SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1480, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1590. In other words, a 1480 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1590 will move you up to above average .  Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 780 750 800  Reading 39 37 40  Writing 38 36 39  Composite 1530 1480 1590     Vanderbilt SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 2120, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2360. In other words, a 2120 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2360 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 760 720 800  Reading 750 710 790  Writing 730 690 770  Composite 2240 2120 2360    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  Vanderbilt has the Score Choice policy of "Highest Section."  This is also known as "superscoring." This means that you can choose which SAT tests you want to send to the school. Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider your highest section scores across all SAT test dates you submit .  Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.   How does superscoring change your test strategy? (Click to Learn)   For example, say you submit the following 3 test scores:      Section  R+W  Math  Composite      Test 1  700  300  1000    Test 2  300  700  1000    Test 3  300  300  600    Superscore  700  700  1400      Even though the highest total you scored on any one test date was 1000, Vanderbilt will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore. You can raise your composite score from 1000 to 1400 in this example.  This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and Vanderbilt forms your Superscore, you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore. Your application readers will only see that one score.    Therefore, if your SAT superscore is currently below a 1590, we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it . You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.  Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the SAT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.    Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?

If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Vanderbilt ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, Vanderbilt likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 34   The average ACT score at Vanderbilt is 34. This score makes Vanderbilt Extremely Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 32, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 35.  Even though Vanderbilt likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 32 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 34 and above that a 32 will look academically weak.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 35 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Vanderbilt, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 35.    Studying for the ACT instead?

SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  Vanderbilt requires you to take the SAT/ACT Writing section . They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that Vanderbilt requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   SAT II scores are not required but will be evaluated. Applicants in engineering are encouraged to take one of the SAT IIs in math. Furthermore, SAT II scores can be used for class placement, so if you have them you should send them.  Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is extremely selective, getting a high SAT/ACT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in . If you don't pass their SAT/ACT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration.  To have the best shot of getting in, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2360 SAT or a 35 ACT . You should also have a 3.8 GPA or higher. If your GPA is lower than this, you need to compensate with a higher SAT/ACT score.  For a school as selective as Vanderbilt, you'll also need to impress them with the rest of your application. We'll cover those details next.  But if you apply with a score below a 2360 SAT or a 35 ACT, you unfortunately start out with the odds against you and have a tiny chance of getting in. There are just too many students with high SAT/ACT scores and strong applications, and you need to compete against them.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into LSU and build a strong application.  School location: Baton Rouge, LA  This school is also known as: Louisiana State University       Admissions Rate: 76%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at LSU is 76% . For every 100 applicants, 76 are admitted.    This means the school is lightly selective . The school will have their expected requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores. If you meet their requirements, you're almost certain to get an offer of admission. But if you don't meet LSU's requirements, you'll be one of the unlucky few people who gets rejected.   LSU GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.43   The average GPA at LSU is 3.43 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 3.43, LSU
	  
	  requires you to be around average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, and very few C's. If you have a lower GPA, you can compensate with harder courses like AP or IB classes. This will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.43, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to LSU. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. LSU SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1210 (Old: 1147)   The average SAT score composite at LSU is a 1210 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1147 . (According to our records, this school requires only Reading and Math, so this score is out of 1600.)  This score makes LSU Competitive for SAT test scores.    LSU SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1100, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1320. In other words, a 1100 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1320 will move you up to above average .  Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 590 540 660  Reading 30 28 33  Composite 1210 1100 1320     LSU SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 1020, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1260. In other words, a 1020 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 1260 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 578 510 640  Reading 569 510 620  Composite 1147 1020 1260    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  LSU has the Score Choice policy of "Highest Sitting."  This means that you can choose which SAT tests you want to send to the school. Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider the SAT score from your single highest test date (the sum of math, reading, and writing).  This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and LSU only considers your highest score on a single test date, you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit your strongest score. Your application readers will only see that one score.  Therefore, if your SAT score is currently below a 1020, we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it . You don't have much to lose, and you can potentially raise your score and significantly boost your chances of getting in.    Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?    Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and SAT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 LSU ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, LSU likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 26   The average ACT score at LSU is 26. This score makes LSU Moderately Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 23, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 28.  Even though LSU likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 23 or below, you'll have a harder time getting in, unless you have something else impressive in your application.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 23 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to LSU, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 23.    Studying for the ACT instead?

SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  LSU considers the SAT/ACT Writing section optional and may not include it as part of their admissions consideration. You don't need to worry too much about Writing for this school, but other schools you're applying to may require it.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that LSU requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   There are minimum admission requirements: you must have a 3.0 unweighted academic GPA based on 19 core units.  Additionally, students must meet either the ACT or SAT requirement: A 22 composite score on the ACT, with an 18 English subscore and a 19 math subscore, or  A 1030 Critical Reading and math composite SAT score, with at least a 450 critical reading score and a 460 math score.  Read more about admission requirements here.  There are higher requirements for scholarships, as listed here.   Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is lightly selective, you have a great shot at getting in, as long as you don't fall well below average . Aim for a 1020 SAT or a 23 ACT or higher, and you'll almost certainly get an offer of admission. As long as you meet the rest of the application requirements below, you'll be a shoo-in.  But if you score below our recommended target score, you may be one of the very few unlucky people to get rejected.

As a counselor at a highly selective college I frequently field questions about standardized testing.  I noticed in recent months, though, that many students I work with don’t apply testing statistics to their college search process appropriately.  Numbers aren’t helpful if you don’t understand their reference.  Here I break down testing statistics: questions to ask to be sure you understand the numbers and how to use the numbers once you understand them.     What’s your average SAT/ACT?  The answer to the above question is not helpful to prospective students.  Why?  First off, averages are susceptible to outliers.  Take the example below:  I have 5 students and their ACT scores are as follows: 30, 30, 30, 30, and 36.  Then the ACT average is 31.2.  If I go around reporting 31.2 as the ACT average a student with a 30 ACT has very little concept of how their testing fits into the picture.  They can’t see that the single 36 is pulling the average upwards.  Furthermore, there is a human tendency to process averages as a benchmark or cutoff.  I watch it happen all the time.  If I told a room of prospective students the average ACT was 31.2 the student with the score of 30 may think they are not a competitive candidate for admission.  Because of the reasons above and others, most colleges report testing as a range. Some of my students find this frustrating, as if a testing range conceals a benchmark, but I promise you they are far more illustrative.    What’s your testing range?  If I just tell you Vanderbilt’s testing range for ACT is 30 to 34 (or 1360 to 1530 for SAT), then you need to ask follow-up questions.  First, question to ask: does that range represent applied, admitted, or enrolled students?  Testing ranges for admitted students will almost always be higher than testing ranges for enrolled students simply because the highest testers have a greater number of post-secondary options.  FYI:  The ranges above are for our enrolled Class of 2014 ; the ranges for the admitted class were 31-34 and 1440-1540.  Another question to ask is: do you superscore tests?  At Vanderbilt we superscore the SAT and we do not superscore the ACT.  Therefore, the testing ranges we report reflect the highest Critical Reading + Math (regardless of test date) for the SAT and the highest ACT Composite in a single sitting.    What does the mid-50% mean?  The vast majority of the time you see testing ranges reported, they are reporting the 25 th percentile through the 75 th percentile, or the mid-50%.  Vanderbilt example: our Class of 2014 ACT mid-50% is 30-34.  Of our 1600 freshmen, 800 of those students have scores that fall at or between a 30 and 34; 400 students scored either a 35 or 36 on the exam and 400 scored 29 or below.  Reporting with ranges is helpful because outliers have less influence.  Additionally, prospective students have a broader understanding of the entire pool with the mid-50%.    I have a 29 on the ACT, am I a competitive applicant?  The answer to that question is the dreaded ‘I don’t know’.  Ranges are instructive because they help prospective students recognize we consider a wide swath of test scores.  There is no cut-off/benchmark/requirement.  There is also no formula or weight assigned to standardized testing at Vanderbilt.  We read applications in a holistic manner , looking at every piece of the puzzle.  Therefore, I won’t know if a student with a 29 ACT is a competitive applicant until I read the other chapters to their story.  Conversely, a student possessing a 35 or 36 on the ACT may look competitive from a testing perspective, but still not receive admission due to other factors.  No, seriously, am I a competitive applicant?  We read holistically, but I’m human and I understand that the testing profile is a convenient numerical way to gauge your competitiveness as an applicant.  Here’s what I tell my students: if you’re within the mid-50% you have a good foundation to your application (but remember there are many other pieces to the puzzle).  If you have a test score above our mid-50%, you have a great foundation.  Don’t slack on the rest of the application or you may not be happy with the result; also, if you have those great scores PLUS a great application we may chase you with merit money.  Finally, if you have a test score below our mid-50%, not all hope is lost!  A quarter of our current freshman class scored below that number and they’re on campus now.  However, with that lower test score, you’ve got to shine on the rest of the application.

I am counting down the days until decisions are mailed, and your posts definitely make it easier by getting more insight into the process! Keep posting :)    David   December 10th, 2010  How much weight does the essay have in the application process?  I understand you want to hear the voice of the applicant, but what if the student failed to really choose an “interesting” topic or something that allowed them to stand out from the rest of the pool?  As long as the grammar and spelling is correct will the counselor deny an applicant based on a weaker essay?  Thank you for your response.    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  David:  There is no weight to the essay.  We have no weights at all in the process. For this reason a student can write a less-than-enthralling essay and still receive admission.  Sam, who I described in a previous post , did not have an essay topic that popped out at me, but he had amazing letters of recommendation.  The x-factor can be different for every student.    Elisa   December 10th, 2010  I have heard that some letters of acceptances will be mailed for ED1 candidates as early as today.  Can you tell me if that is occurring, or are you on track to mail every letter on December 15th, as previously posted? Thank you.    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  Elisa:  All of the letters are going out at the same time.  Right now it looks as if they will mail on either the evening of the 14th or the morning of the 15th.  They’re definitely not going out today!    David   December 10th, 2010  I had heard from several Vanderbilt students that they (in the past) received email acceptances.  Was that the case and is there any chance that we will hear online or phone, this year?    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  David: We do not release decisions via email unless the applicant is currently living outside of the United States.  Students cannot learn of their decisions via phone until December 21st.    Amber   December 10th, 2010  All this waiting is definitely making me nauseous. If it weren’t so obviously psychological I would strongly embrace the Pepto Bismol.    Sarah   December 10th, 2010  Of all of your students you have had for ED1, about how many have you accepted?    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  Sarah: We will publish these numbers at the close of Early Decision in February.    hugh   December 10th, 2010  do i still have a chance if my TOEFL is 95, which is below the minimum requirement?    Kylie   December 12th, 2010  Hugh: We will give every application a holistic review, but generally we are looking for TOEFL scores at 100 or above.    Hannah   December 11th, 2010  Thanks so much! This blog is helping me keep calm until ED1 decisions are mailed! This was also a helpful insight into what test scores really mean, how I fit into the numbers and how y’all view numbers!    Gibson   December 12th, 2010  So when should we expect our letters with our decision? On the 15th? Or later?    Christa   December 13th, 2010  Do Regular Decision applicants who turn in their apps. early find out any sooner than last-minute Regular Decisions?  Thanks!    Kylie   December 13th, 2010  Christa: No.  All RD students will receive notification according to our calendar : April 1st unless you are a scholarship recipient.    Sarah   December 19th, 2010  Hi! I hope all is well!  If I am applying for a scholarship, will the credentials I submit for the scholarship be viewed at the same time as my application for admission is reviewed? I am applying ED2, fyi.    Travis   December 29th, 2010  I heard some colleges only look at the English and math sections of the ACT.  Is this true for Vanderbilt?  My highest composite ACT score is a 30.  When I got the 30 I scored a 25 on the English section and a 35 on the math section.  However, on another test where my composite ACT score was a 29, I got a 32 on English and 34 on math.  Clearly, the english score is 7 points higher with the 29 composite score, yet 29 is a worse composite score than a 30.  Should I send my composite score of a 30 or a 29?  Please let me know! Thank you!    Kylie   December 30th, 2010  Travis:  We will consider your single highest composite score.    Robbie   January 28th, 2011  Hello! I commend all of you guys who have earned a 30 or higher on the ACT. I really wish that could be me hopefully in February. My question is, honestly, what are the number or students who have been accepted with a composite of 25? I have a low composite but I have a really good subscore of 29 in English and mid 20s in the other subtests. I also have good recommendations, rank,GPA, and essay. Do you think that I still have a chance at being accepted into Vanderbilt.    Kylie   January 28th, 2011  Robbie:  As much as I know this isn’t necessarily the answer you want- it depends.  Of our enrolled applicants who submitted ACT scores, 25% had scores lower than a 30.  Many different factors go into the application, it truly is more than just numbers.  Thus, knowing your testing doesn’t help me identify if you “have a chance”.  Know that admission is difficult for all of our applicants and I wish you the best of luck!    Christy   August 8th, 2011  In our town my daughter has the opportunity to attend a selective magnet high school or attend a typical high school that offers the “IB” diploma.  Which would be more attractive to Vanderbilt (all other things being equal). She really has her heart on being a student at Vandy! I was going to call and ask, but I stumbled across this blog and thought I might give this a shot. Thanks!    Tricia   October 25th, 2011  Do you now superscore the ACT?    Ryan Burleson   October 26th, 2011  Thanks for your question, Tricia. We don’t superscore the ACT, we just consider a student’s highest composite score. Our position is that the ACT is not as well-suited to be superscored because of the nature of the test. There is simply not as much wiggle room for the ACT since it is only based on a 36 point scale.    julie   December 20th, 2011  Just wondering how merit money or the discount rate is at your school for strong students.  My parents have no savings for college due to loss of a job a few years in the past and the three siblings that will need college after me.  But on a financial aid form their income currently is way too high for aid.  I have a strong resume of school activities, a GPA of over 4 and ACT of 31.  I am top in my school but don’t have an ACT of 36 to put me over into the extreme numbers category. What does the picture look like for a student like me.  I am beginning to think the best colleges are only for the poor and the truly wealthy,upper middle class need not apply? Julie    Carolyn Pippen   December 20th, 2011  Hi Julie,  Our need-based financial aid process if very extensive and takes into account much more than just the parents’ income (things like, I have four siblings in school, or all of our money is in assets, etc).  This is why we actually require two forms – the FAFSA and the CSS Profile – to make sure we have considered all aspects of your financial situation.  Once you have filled out these forms, we garauntee to meet 100% of your demonstrated need, loan-free.  In addition, we do have merit-based scholarships as well.  I highly encourage you to apply for both of these forms of aid, regardless of what you think your package might turn out to be. For more information feel free to visit the financial aid website ( http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/financial-aid-facts.php ) or contact our Financial Aid office at 615-322-3591.    Tootie   January 2nd, 2012  hi i graduate in 2019 and ive been researching on collages and before i decided to do this my only choices were harverd or yale to get my law degree but now you guys are in my options list! You guys rock and thanks for being their for us and hopefully i get the right SAT or ACT score to be accepted!

Mihika   December 14th, 2014  Hello, my Sat score is quite low and my score was 1640. Should i still apply to Vanderbilt University or not? What are my chances?    Jay Watson   December 15th, 2014  Hi Mihika, thanks for your question. The best resource to start with is the profile of our current students (here: http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/profile/ ). With the profile, you can see how your scores compare to our middle 50%. As we say in the post, we can’t know your chances without reviewing the rest of your application (not to mention the rest of the applicant pool). The middle 50% gives you a good starting place to evaluate your application – beyond that, it would be a good idea to speak with your admissions counselor to discuss other aspects of your application. You can find your counselor’s contact information at http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/your-counselor/ Thanks!    Grace   October 2nd, 2015  Does the fact that I have not joined one club in high school lower my chances of being accepted?    Jay Watson   October 2nd, 2015  Thanks for your question. Just as we don’t have cut-off scores for testing, we don’t have minimums for club or organization involvement. Instead, we evaluate activities outside the classroom in terms of depth of involvement, roles and responsibilities, and leadership. We want to know what you spend your time on and what you’re passionate about. That doesn’t have to be a high school club – it could be volunteer work, a business or non-profit you started or work for, some kind of artistic or athletic endeavor, or many other things. Again, thanks for your question!    Jason Knapp   January 12th, 2016  How does a high rising trend look to the committee? Example: Someone who started off with a 3.1 freshman year, 3.4 sophomore year and a 3.9 this year. Also I am a volunteer EMT, so would that help at all? Thanks!    Jay Watson   January 12th, 2016  Hi Jason, thank you for your question. A positive trend in your GPA through high school is definitely favorable. Remember that our academic evaluation takes into consideration the rigor of your curriculum – we’re not just looking for strong grades, but we also want to see that you are making those strong grades in classes that are challenging. Your experience as an EMT is also something that will be considered. If that is something you are truly passionate about, make sure that comes through in your application. Again, thanks for your question and your interest in Vanderbilt!    Connor Castleberry   February 22nd, 2016  How much is the ACT writing portion considered? I got a 35 ACT composite score but a 14 for my writing. Thank you for your response.    Jay Watson   February 29th, 2016  Thanks for your question. First, remember that standardized testing is only a part of our holistic application process. And while the writing portion of the ACT is required, the composite score is the more important factor in our process.    Vivian Hsu   April 19th, 2016  As an international student from Asia, I studied high school since my freshman year. English is not my native language. May I have an idea if you will consider it being a factor for lower SAT 2040?    Jay Watson   April 21st, 2016  Thanks for your question. Applicants whose native language is not English have specific admissions requirements. You should check our requirements for international students page at http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/apply/international.php     Harrison   May 3rd, 2016  How much does the score of your essay on an ACT affect the admissions process? For example, I got a 35 composite ACT score but I messed up the essay and only got an 18 on the essay. Also, I have a 750 on SAT English section. If i were to send both SAT and ACT scores, do I need to worry about the essay score or do you think the low essay score might be disregarded considering my admissions essays and high SAT English score? Thanks!    Jay Watson   May 11th, 2016  Thanks for your question, Harrison. Beginning with admission for the Class of 2021, the writing section of the ACT and the Essay section of the SAT are not required. You can also talk more thoroughly about your individual testing with your Vanderbilt admissions counselor. Thanks.    Cristina   September 6th, 2016  I have a question regarding gpa. Do you guys count the weighted gpa or unweighted gpa? Also, I volunteer at the Audobon Center, which works with environmental matters and what I want to major in is environmental science and I took AP Environmental Science and passed with a 4, would this favor me when it comes to admissions?    Jay Watson   September 20th, 2016  Hi Cristina, thanks for your questions. Regarding GPA, we evaluate based on what your high school reports on your official transcript. And, yes, we do consider your “fit” for the academic school to which you are applying, and your academic record and outside involvement are certainly considered. Again, thanks for your interest.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into Vanderbilt and build a strong application.  School location: Nashville, TN  This school is also known as: Vanderbilt University, Vandy       Admissions Rate: 12%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at Vanderbilt is 12% . For every 100 applicants, only 12 are admitted.    This means the school is extremely selective . Meeting their GPA requirements and SAT/ACT requirements is very important to getting past their first round of filters and proving your academic preparation. If you don't meet their expectations, your chance of getting is nearly zero. After crossing this hurdle, you'll need to impress Vanderbilt application readers through their other application requirements, including extracurriculars, essays, and letters of recommendation. We'll cover more below.   Vanderbilt GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.8   The average GPA at Vanderbilt is 3.8 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 3.8, Vanderbilt
	  
	  requires you to be near the top of your class , and well above average. Your transcript should show mostly A's. Ideally, you will also have taken several AP or IB classes to show that you can handle academics at a college level.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.8, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to Vanderbilt. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. Vanderbilt SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1530 (Old: 2240)   The average SAT score composite at Vanderbilt is a 1530 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 2240 .  This score makes Vanderbilt Extremely Competitive for SAT test scores.    Vanderbilt SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1480, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1590. In other words, a 1480 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1590 will move you up to above average .  Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 780 750 800  Reading 39 37 40  Writing 38 36 39  Composite 1530 1480 1590     Vanderbilt SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 2120, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2360. In other words, a 2120 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2360 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 760 720 800  Reading 750 710 790  Writing 730 690 770  Composite 2240 2120 2360    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  Vanderbilt has the Score Choice policy of "Highest Section."  This is also known as "superscoring." This means that you can choose which SAT tests you want to send to the school. Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider your highest section scores across all SAT test dates you submit .  Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.   How does superscoring change your test strategy? (Click to Learn)   For example, say you submit the following 3 test scores:      Section  R+W  Math  Composite      Test 1  700  300  1000    Test 2  300  700  1000    Test 3  300  300  600    Superscore  700  700  1400      Even though the highest total you scored on any one test date was 1000, Vanderbilt will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore. You can raise your composite score from 1000 to 1400 in this example.  This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and Vanderbilt forms your Superscore, you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore. Your application readers will only see that one score.    Therefore, if your SAT superscore is currently below a 1590, we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it . You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.  Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the SAT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.    Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?

If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Vanderbilt ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, Vanderbilt likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 34   The average ACT score at Vanderbilt is 34. This score makes Vanderbilt Extremely Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 32, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 35.  Even though Vanderbilt likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 32 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 34 and above that a 32 will look academically weak.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 35 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Vanderbilt, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 35.    Studying for the ACT instead?

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  Vanderbilt requires you to take the SAT/ACT Writing section . They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that Vanderbilt requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   SAT II scores are not required but will be evaluated. Applicants in engineering are encouraged to take one of the SAT IIs in math. Furthermore, SAT II scores can be used for class placement, so if you have them you should send them.  Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is extremely selective, getting a high SAT/ACT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in . If you don't pass their SAT/ACT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration.  To have the best shot of getting in, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2360 SAT or a 35 ACT . You should also have a 3.8 GPA or higher. If your GPA is lower than this, you need to compensate with a higher SAT/ACT score.  For a school as selective as Vanderbilt, you'll also need to impress them with the rest of your application. We'll cover those details next.  But if you apply with a score below a 2360 SAT or a 35 ACT, you unfortunately start out with the odds against you and have a tiny chance of getting in. There are just too many students with high SAT/ACT scores and strong applications, and you need to compete against them.

This tool provides only a simplistic estimate of your chances of admission. Instead of treating this tool as a crystal ball, we recommend you consider the big picture of what your chance means:  80-100%: Safety school: Strong chance of getting in  50-80%: More likely than not getting in  20-50%: Lower but still good chance of getting in  5-20%: Reach school: Unlikely to get in, but still have a shot  0-5%: Hard reach school: Very difficult to get in  We recommend you apply to schools across a range of chances. Applying to some safety schools will guarantee you have a college to go to, while applying to some reach schools will give you a shot at getting into the school at the top of your range.

CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014    edited August 2014   in Vanderbilt University      My daughter is planning to apply Early Decision at Vanderbilt this fall. Any idea what her chances are?  Stats are:  GPA: Unweighted 3.89 Weighted 4.05 (All challenging courses throughout HS, including AP, honors and multiple advanced and dual-enrollment courses. Five additional dual-enroll courses will be completed this year, including calculus.) ACT: 10th grade - 30 11th grade - 31 (She will be taking it again before deadline) NHS: 11th grade - Treasurer 12th grade - President Choir - 4 years Volleyball - 4 years (co-captain 2 years) Pre-Cal award - 11th grade Spanish award - 10th grade Spanish II award - 11th grade (her dad's parents are Cuban so she had an advantage in that) Tutors Pre-Cal & Algebra  Thanks for any input on this.     0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook       « 1 2 »      Go  Replies to: What are my D's chances of getting into Vanderbilt?       #1     lacsalltheway    Registered User  Posts: 19  New Member      August 2014       Hello.  I am a current student at Vandy.  Standardized testing-wise, I would say she is on the lower side.  However, her GPA is very promising.  Her extracurriculars are not very impressive.  However, I think she definitely has a shot IF she does early decision.  She will have a better chance if she can raise the ACT score to a 33 or 34.  But I encourage her to apply early decision.  There is a place for everyone at Vanderbilt, and I have not heard one student say that they are not happy at this school.  Early decision would greatly benefit her with her chances of getting in.  For early decision, I would say she has a 50/50 shot of getting in, honestly.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014       Thank you for the input! We are hoping that the ACT score will come up some. Regarding extracurriculars, she goes to a very small private school that honestly doesn't offer a whole lot in that realm. However, she is consistently involved in organizing the blood drive (Blood Assurance) and volunteers for the ESL program. I didn't mention those earlier since they are volunteer activities set up through NHS. Honestly, I wasn't sure if they should be counted separately since they are done as part of her NHS commitment. Thanks again for your response!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     lacsalltheway    Registered User  Posts: 19  New Member      August 2014       No problem. Do not be discouraged with the test scores.  I know many students here who were in the same position as your daughter and got into this school.  She definitely is a competitive applicant because her GPA is very good.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014       I should also have mentioned that her senior project is implementing a sadly lacking recycling/go green program at her school and starting a club to continue the work and advocate for the cause after she's gone. Hoping that will be well underway by the time she applies so she can include it on her app.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     KaMaMom    Registered User  Posts: 888  Member      August 2014       Hi there ... my daughter was admitted ED1 this past year.  And the gist I get from all of the admits that I know about is that their GPAs were near perfect, ACT/SAT were very high and though they were very busy with ecs, there was one ec that really stood out ... if musically talented, then lots of involvement and all-state band or all-state choir, if forensics, they were national qualifiers or there was a twist on a "typical extra curricular", etc..  And not a twist for a twists sake ;) but their passion really showed through.  But from personal experience, if Vandy is her first choice, ED is definitely the way to go.  I believe the acceptance rate is somewhere around 20% for ED and drops drastically for RD.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     bud123    Registered User  Posts: 673  Member      August 2014       The admission process at the most selective U's is not an exact science.  Parents and students want to know #'s and boxes to check but ADCOMs talk about building a class, diversity, and the holistic process.  How does OZ behind the curtain determine which qualified students get to go to Kansas??? The best you can do is look at the admission data to get an idea of what each U looks at.  Vandy's SAT/ACT scores are now higher than 5/8 ivies , Duke and Stanford.  It's fair to say someone is looking closely at these scores.  The Vandy admissions blog year after year report 100% of incoming students received significant awards or held significant leadership positions.  Not 99%, 100%.  Someone is looking at these EC's.  47% are varsity athletes, 37% held major positions or received awards in the fine arts.  So it helps to excel at something outside the classroom.  Schools also like students that use their smarts to improve their school or the community. Your D has a strong application.  Get that ACT to 33, take the SAT too and send the higher score, write a great essay, and talk to teachers who can write her an outstanding LoR.  2   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014       Good info! Thank you:) Yes, she is working hard to bring her score up a couple points. And the LoR's will be no issue. My main concern is extracurriculars...also leadership.

I am sorry but I do not think your daughter is a strong ED applicant, as yet. Her GPA is very good, but most successful Vanderbilt applicants have similar or better GPAs. Her test scores obviously are a bit too low for a strong candidate. Vanderbilt is ranked 7th in the nation by SAT/ACT scores. Its average scores (including ED) are 1490 and 33 respectively, which place Vanderbilt above Stanford, Duke and UPenn, and only Harvard, Yale, Princeton among the ivies are better than Vanderbilt. Further, your daughter's ecs do not seem very impressive.  So, if your daughter is seriously interested in Vanderbilt, I believe she NEEDS to 1. improve her SAT/ACT scores (which will also give her a better chance at other good schools) 2. keep on her good work at school so that she could maintain/better her GPA 3. write a really impressive essay to demonstrate why she is special (Remember, it takes time to write a good essay) 4. be realistic (only 20% of very qualified ED applicants will be admitted) and make good backup plans  Your daughter has been doing excellently, and you should be proud of your daughter regardless of the outcome of her Vanderbilt application. I hope she will get admitted to Vanderbilt if that is what she wants.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      August 2014       Thank you for the input:) Guess we'll see soon enough..  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      December 2014       Big decision day is getting close...one more question for anyone that wants to weigh in. High school guidance counselor told her that Vanderbilt called "asking a whole lot of questions about her". Is this pretty routine or a good sign? Counselor didn't elaborate on the conversation, nor did Kris ask her to. She DID say counselor seemed excited for her...but then Joan is ALWAYS happy and bubbly lol..so IDK how seriously to take this:/ Any thoughts?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #12     CnKinChatt    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      December 2014       Or is it, heaven forbid, a bad sign? As in, they're picking her apart or questioning something on her app? But I can't think of anything on her app that could possibly be in question. Also, I can't imagine her counselor would have been so cheerful if she felt the conversation with the Vandy person was a negative. I'm probably just overthinking it:/  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #13     DoremomCT    Registered User  Posts: 34  Junior Member      December 2014       I would hope for the best.

ECs look good as well.  Unfortunately, we can only give you a very general sense of where your app is from a CC post, but I'd say you have solid chances. Everything is where it should be, but you're not an absolute lock. At this point, all you can do is make sure the subjective portions of your app (essays, recs) are high quality and see what happens.  Chances of admissions are greater in the ED round (although it's hard to predict how EDII works vs EDI/RD), so it would be a good idea to run the net price calculator and also decide which school is your first choice. If Vanderbilt's on top, and seems financially doable, pulling the trigger on ED would be a good idea. It's likely that with a large number of applications you would be accepted at a top 20 school in the RD round, but you just can't be sure where that will be. You definitely wouldn't be out of the running for RD either, but a lot of good candidates end up waitlisted.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     ver1818    Registered User  Posts: 3  New Member      November 2017       Thank you for the advice!

I took the campus tour and admissions information session a couple years ago.  I learned that roughly half the class comes from early decision but only 15% of all applications are ED.  So it appears that applying early will really boost your chances.  If you apply early, you will also be organized enough to apply for the merit scholarships, which require some additional work but can be well worth the time invested.

VU is no less holistic than any other top U.  They are just doing a better job of enrolling more of these students. Check out their CDS for the numbers needed.

I was surprised to see that their EBRW 75% level is "only" 770.  I'm sure that they will try and get that number up if they use their waitlist.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     amNotarobot    Registered User  Posts: 168  Junior Member      April 2017       Early Decision, especially ED1.

While Vandy is of course holistic like all top 25 schools are, the numbers don't lie.  The 25-75 ACT range for Vandy's 2020 enrolled class was 32-35.  That's the same as Princeton.  Stanford's was 31-35.  School's like Vandy in the 11-25 band obviously weight test scores more heavily than the 1-10 schools do.  There's no single magic bullet.  But if you really want to get into Vandy, applying ED with a 35 ACT is a great start.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #13     bernie12    Registered User  Posts: 4,890  Senior Member      April 2017    edited April 2017        @northwesty :  And then there was Cornell, Emory, Georgetown, Berkeley, Dartmouth, and Brown.  Interesting catch for the top 10 though.  Even those with really high scores have been in the same score range for years or a decade.  They have maybe been slightly fluctuating up and down but haven't been trying desperately to add 10-20 points each year.  And the schools I refer to are HYPMCoCh(Ch is new to the score emphasis.  It changed to the same admissions scheme as VU, WUSTL)  and of course Caltech (this is just natural at STEM schools).  Then there is another cohort that are basically identical score wise that, for SAT, have taken a while to or refuse to hit 1400 for the bottom 25%.  These are Duke, Penn, Stanford, and JHU (though JHU has shot up and appears to be using the scheme that increases the scores quickly) as as far as I know.  But even among those in the high score brackets.  The score in that range will do little to predict an admit or wait-list because many applying in their score range are applying as a top choice for sure meaning more folks in those ranges will be denied than at other schools where the yield is solid but still much lower.  They pretty much just focus on other things when even around the score range.   In addition, Vanderbilt is one of the places that used to give a  speech on the admissions website about how SAT levels the playing field. I have also read language in strategic planning documents suggesting that their admissions is now a "meritocracy" which suggests intentionality(made up word) and a potential agenda.  So they could have begun placing that much emphasis on the scores due to a mixture of wanting to drive up the rank and also because of these ideals.   There is also this which I find strange: https://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/vandybloggers/2017/02/class-of-2021-early-decision-summary-statistics/  Why list a percent of students that has a "major" leadership position?  It almost seems as if the admissions office has caught on to students perception the stats emphasis so they write in distractors like that to suggest that they care just as much, which they may, but that is a very strong claim and one may want to know how that is defined.  It just reads a bit fake, like when a certain president's press person comes out and says "biggest inauguration ever!".  I mean, why say anything about it?   Either way, Vanderbilt is not the only non-STEM Ivy using this admissions scheme.  I just do not understand why use it.  Increasing the scores will do very little for performance beyond a certain threshold.  Perhaps schools like Chicago can almost justify it because they still known for a much more stressful academic environment than peer schools and were known for it before they chose to pump of SATs.  But for schools generally not known for super stressful academics (and this is giving them benefit of the doubt, I think other metrics can be used to measure students ability to handle this because these schools are not usually stressful because the courses give multiple choice tests that are  quite coachable.  They are known for heavier workloads and maybe exams that are intentionally unpredictable or unusually challenging), I do not really see the point.  I guess you'll start seeing higher grades in disciplines that are considered easier? Or ones where multiple teachers still do have multiple choice (easy MC at that) as the major form of assessment?  Which, I think should not be the case at any elite school.  I just think the emphasis should be tailored to predict success in much more challenging situations (but we all know it has nothing to do with maintaining or enhancing academic standards.  It has nothing to do with undergraduates themselves at all.  Who wants to bet that each cohort that has 50SAT points or .5ACT points higher than the last has almost exactly the same EC profile at these schools?).  Apparently, while GPAs and class rank are inflated, they have been shown to have more predictive capabilities by many studies.  These elite highered maneuvers in admissions just get old to me.  They already have high achieving student bodies.  Instead of trying to make the SAT average a 1550/1600 instead of a 1540, get back to ensuring that these folks get a challenging, modern education that the schools are supposed to deliver on.  Using the admissions office to represent the prestige and quality of the school is just getting old and nearly all are guilty.  rant over:  Until they stop focusing on this, if you applying to one of those schools, aim for a 35-36 if you desperately want to get in.  It will not remotely guarantee you but chances will be more correlated than at other schools.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #14     bernie12    Registered User  Posts: 4,890  Senior Member      April 2017    edited April 2017       BTW, the first list are basically schools that have yet to have an incoming class with a 1400 25% on the old SAT as far as I know.  Really, there are maybe only 2-3 in the 15-25 bracket that have met and surpass that bar.  And the thing is you can't just claim all the others are failing.  Dartmouth, Brown, and Cornell definitely have a choice, and it appears they are choosing not to.  Even many of the elite LACs choose not to and they very well could I bet.  So among places with the super high application volume (and even those who don't like Rice which is getting close), it appears to be a choice.  Most schools remain normal and saw periods of normal growth in admissions and some chose schemes that got much quicker change to the score brackets as soon as the application volume increased.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #15     bernie12    Registered User  Posts: 4,890  Senior Member      April 2017    edited April 2017       Just some evidence that there is a particular strategy that can be employed (and has been) if you want a quicker rise in stats and national standing (basically these patterns of sudden popularity and high app. volume for certain schools is not magical or prospective students "waking up" all of the sudden).   Chicago's changes were highlighted here.  Seems the schools outside of the top 10 with unusual high score brackets employed similar strategies for different reasons and sadly, I think in terms of the rank, USNews has caught on.  There seems to be a ceiling for schools without the academic reputation of some of those top 10 schools.  Hence, why WUSTL can fluctuate despite it also having HYPM like score range. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/education/edlife/07HOOVER-t.html .  Again, schools employing this strategy should now refocus efforts on offering differing academics than competitor schools because this method has its limits in terms of attracting certain types of students and has marginal effects on the rankings for some places.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook        « 1 2 3 4 »      Go    Sign In or Register to comment.

HaveYouMetTed    Registered User  Posts: 39  Junior Member      February 2013    edited February 2013   in Vanderbilt University      I realize that the middle 50% of Vanderbilt's accepted students have scores of 1400-1580. I, however, only have a 2070/2400 or a 1350/1600. What I would like to know is do I even have a chance at getting into Vanderbilt with my score? Should I just expect rejection because of my score or is there another weak point on my application that will also affect my admission decision?  Does anyone think I have a chance at getting in? Here are my stats.   School: I am a senior and I attend a very small Catholic college preparatory high school in a rural area that has like 46 students total. My own senior class has only 11 students. My school offers very little AP's and no honors classes. I've been offered only AP US History (junior year) and AP Calculus AB (senior year) both of which I have taken or am taking. In order to challenge myself I took AP US Government and Politics through an online independent course my Junior year. In my senior year I am taking both AP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics through an online independent course (I'm interested in business. I am also taking three classes through a dual-enrollment program (between my high school and a local community college). They are Principles of Biology, Biology Lab, and Basic Public Speaking. In addition, I am taking College Web Design and Development independently online through a community college. In high school I have also taken College Algebra and Writing I.  Course Load: Junior Year: AP US History and AP US Gov (apart from the other regular classes I take) Senior Year: AP Calculus AB, AP Micro, AP Macro, College Web Design and Development, College Bio, College Speech (apart from the other regular classes I take)  GPA: around a 3.94 (UW) and 4.0 (W) This is only freshman through junior year. Freshman Year: 3.77 (I got a couple B+'s. :\) Sophomore Year: 4.0 Junior Year: 4.21 Senior Year: With all A's at the end could be like a 4.3 I think.  Recommendations: Getting one from a history teacher who I think really likes me and Literature teacher who said she'd love to write me one. I'm also sending in one from the manager of a local brokerage firm I interned at.  Essay: About a very close family friend who recently passed away. I didn't make it a sympathy story, but rather how he was like a wise and funny grandfatherly figure in my life. I also explained some hardships he overcame and how he overcame those hardships and how I should be able to overcome hardships too. (Btw the 500 limit is really hard to stay in)  Class Rank: 1/11 (Like I said my school is tiny)  Scores: SAT: 2070 (670 CR, 680 M, 720 W) SAT Subject Tests: 760 US History (because of background from AP US history) and a really really bad Bio score (no AP Bio was offered to me and it really made SAT Bio tough for me) I don't plan to send.  AP Exams: AP US History (4), AP Gov (3), AP Euro (3)  Leadership: Captain of JV academic Team (10th) Captain of Varsity Academic Team (12th) Captain of the JV History Bowl Team (10th) Captain of the Varsity History Bowl Team (10th) National Honor Society Treasurer (11th) National Honor Society President (12th) Student Council Class Representative (9th and 10th grade) Student Council Treasurer (11th and 12th) Y-Club President (11th grade) Quartermaster of Boys Scout Troop (9th grade) Troop Guide of Boy Scout Troop (10th grade) Assistant Senior Patrol Leader of Boy Scout Troop (11th grade) Webmaster of Boy Scout Troop (12th grade) Order of the Arrow Section Secretary (10th-12th grade)  Extracurriculars: Academic Team (9th-12th grade) History Bowl (10th-12th grade) History Bee (10th-12th grade) Student Council (9-12th grade) National Honor Society (10th-12th grade) Y-Club (9th-11th grade) Science Olympiad (9th-12th grade) Boy Scouts (I've been doing boys scouts for like 6 years) Summer internship at a local brokerage firm (due to my interest in business and finance)  Volunteer Work: Local Hospital: Worked in the Pharmacy Department. Stocked newly shipped medications, filled out Pixus orders, and delivered the medications from the order to each floor’s Pixus machine Helping Hand thrift store: Assorted donated clothes and shoes, guided shoppers around the store, and cleaned the store after office hours Math and Science Camp: Assisted kids with the science projects and experiments that were being demonstrated by teachers God’s Appalachian Project: Stocked new shipments of food, guided and aided shoppers around the store, and organized clothes Relay for Life: Participated in through Boy Scouts. Put together hundreds of candles in bags and placed the, around a track in honor of those who had passed away with cancer or had been fighting it Habitat for Humanity: Help put up the foundations and walls off houses, and unloaded trucks full of supplies for the houses  I have also been involved with volunteer work with clubs at school. For Y-Club I helped raise $750 for a bake sale for the Haiti Earthquake. I also participated in Safe Trick or Treat Events. I have organized multiple food drives for underprivileged people and delivered food to the families for National Honors Society.  My own Eagle Scout Project: Collected hundreds of books and various school supplies for “Books for Africa” organization and held a 3k walk-a-thon and raised around $1000 to cover shipping fees to send the books to Africa.  Awards and Honors: First Honors for 9th grade year First Honors for 10th grade year First Honors for 11th grade year World History Book Award, 9th grade European History Book Award, 10th grade Geometry Book Award, 10th grade General Excellence Book Award, 10th and 11th grade AP US History Book Award, 11th grade University of Kentucky “Class of Kentucky” representative, 10th grade Commonwealth Ambassador, 12th grade AP Scholar Eagle Scout Kentucky Colonel (awarded because of my Eagle Scout but nonetheless the biggest honor awarded by the state) Outstanding Youth Leadership Award (came from a state representative)  Accomplishments: Academic Team: I placed in numerous District and Regional competitions throughout my high school career. National History Bowl: Captained my JV team to the National Competition National History Bee: placed 4th in state bee in 10th grade and 5th in state bee in 11th grade and advanced and competed in Nationals and have also advanced to Nationals this year. Science Olympiad: Placed in Regional competitions throughout my high school career Boy Scouts: elected into service society Order of the Arrow, became Eagle Scout, and have gotten numerous merit badges and nights of camping  Also in case it matters I'm a turbaned Sikh/Indian male.

The Middle 50% with SATs of 1400-1580 means a quarter of the class comes in with something below a 1400. A 1350 isn't far off and you have a great profile.

I just would like to ask a few more things. What type of applicants are usually accepted in the lower 25%? I mean no disrespect to anyone, but aren't a portion of these acceptances given to athletes who may be so committed to a sport and therefore unable to have such high scores or grades or even people who have not had the opportunities or resources as others? (I do not mean to stereotype athletes, minorities, or anyone for that matter. I know there are plenty who have better scores, grades, etc. than me.) Also, many people have brought up the argument that if your Asian you must have a "high score" or it is almost expected. I would really like what you have to say about all these questions because you are a current Vandy student right? Once again thanks in advance!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     Pancaked    Registered User  Posts: 3,355  Senior Member      February 2013       A portion of them are athletes, yes, but recruited athletes do not make up 25% of the student body. I can't really tell you much about the profiles of the lower 25% other than they are probably better than the typical accepted student, other than SAT score.  There are some schools where Asian students are overrepresented and as such are at a slight disadvantage in admissions. This is not the case at Vanderbilt.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     Love2Travel95    Registered User  Posts: 28  New Member      February 2013       Also a Vandy applicant. 1350/1600, 2130/2400 (low Critical Reading) Math Level 2: 780 (although with 6 B's in Honors Math, and 1 C in AP Calculus - the MAIN reason for my 3.7 UW) I come from a very competitive high school in Cali. 3.7 UW, 4.0 W with an upward trend.

All other varsity athletes get into Vandy the same way as everyone else--with high GPAs, lots of APs, high SAT/ACT scores and good recommendations. There are two differences between these athletes and the traditional candidate:  1) They sign a NLI which binds them to the school and 2) They participate in their sport 25-30 hours a week while getting high GPAs, high SAT/SCT scores, taking 5 APS, etc.  Therefore, the bottom 25% of applicants do not have a substantial number of athletes in the mix. The bottom 25% are simply great students that perhaps do not test well, or bring another stellar attribute (music, theater, public speaking, community service, etc.) to the community as a whole that is not reflected in test scores.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     HaveYouMetTed    Registered User  Posts: 39  Junior Member      February 2013       Thanks for your feedback @Pancaked and @vandyswim .  So @vandyswim do you think my application shows that I can bring anything to Vandy?  And @Love2Travel95 I feel like we have pretty similar situations apart from the fact that you attend a more competitive high school than me.

Looking back, I really believe that applying ED gives you a better shot.  If you apply RD you are more likely to get lost in the shuffle considering the volume of applications they receive at that time.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     2VU0609    Registered User  Posts: 3,189  Senior Member      June 2010       timeflew, I can assure you that the essays are read.

However, I still think that if funnysac really, really wants to go to Vandy applying ED would be an advantage.  There were LOTS of kids with dream resumes waitlisted at Vandy this year, and I have to believe that it was at least in part because lots of other kids with dream resume's had sent in their applications earlier.  When they already have a huge YES stack, are counselors really going to spend as much time with later applications?  Perhaps yes, but why not apply ED and lessen the odds of getting lost in the crowd later?  I think this is true for all of the tow 20 schools since common app came on the scene.  2VU0609, do you have any advice for funnysac and other prospects on how to stand out in a crowd of high stat applicants?  Any inside info that can help them?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     2VU0609    Registered User  Posts: 3,189  Senior Member      June 2010       When my kids applied the applicant pool was much smaller.  Both the child who worked in admissions and the good friend of that child who worked there as a student worker and for a year following graduation (not the admissions counselor) used to joke that they weren't confident that they would be admitted several years later.  ED is a distinct advantage.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     timeflew    Registered User  Posts: 608  Member      June 2010       I can't decide if I like or hate the common app.  It certainly has changed the admissions landscape, hasn't it?

If Vanderbilt is your first choice, and financial aid is not an issue, apply ED. If, on the other hand, $ is a concern (perhaps you're budgeting for grad school as well) or if there are schools you like slightly more, apply RD. My D loved Vandy and always thought she'd wind up attending; however, at the time she applied, there were a few schools she also really liked. Her argument was if she applied ED, she might always wonder "what if".  Suffice to say, she did RD. Like TimeFlew's D, she was waitlisted with VERY, VERY impressive stats/ecs/essays. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest. (She was also waitlisted at most all of the ivys.) So, in hindsight would she have done things differently? Probably not. She did get accepted at some great schools, and after dome recovery time, she's now very excited about the school she'll be attending. For what it's worth, here are a few things you might consider when making your decision:  A) Certain schools/colleges within Vandy are easier to get into than others. You might think about this when applying. B) You're from a heavily represented state, so competition will be more intense. C) RD rate dropped this year to 13+% from 20 something percent last year.

I'm facing the same dilemma as your daughter with deciding (although possibly prematurely) whether to apply ED or RD.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #14     Faline2    Registered User  Posts: 4,201  Senior Member      June 2010       retake your ACT with as much prep as you can stand this summer at home..use the Red Book ..32 is a score to be proud of but you might as well see if you can gain a couple of points  do not consider Vandy anything but a reach...this is due to numbers of applicants only and is zero reflection on your abilities.  get to know Vandy and only apply to the college within it that makes absolute sense for your future...and make sure your essays are specific to Vanderbilt  love love love and respect your safety colleges and match colleges.  only apply to colleges you can attend with pride.  Visualize yourself making life long friends at match colleges..attend classes there as well as at reach colleges.  Realize that there are scores of colleges with professors as fine as the professors at Vanderbilt and there can be advantages to attendeing colleges that are less selective than Vanderbilt.  Doing a fab job at a match college can result in fine grad school choices.  We were very lucky because our state colleges in VA are outcomes that are easy to live with so our sons were prepared to stay in state, but don't neglect your match college in your affections.  Give your heart to your application essays to all.  best of luck.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #15     anothercrazymom    Registered User  Posts: 1,736  Senior Member      June 2010       My son got into Vanderbilt this RD year and quite frankly we were shocked, they had a 16.3% admit rate this year and my son's GPA was so-so. He did have a 2250 on the SAT and 750 or better on all his SAT II's. I did not read his application so I can only assmume his essays were good. He decided to go to W&M because they have an IR major and he likes their club rowing team. Anyway, I say go for it, you never know.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook        « 1 2 »      Go    This discussion has been closed.

As a counselor at a highly selective college I frequently field questions about standardized testing.  I noticed in recent months, though, that many students I work with don’t apply testing statistics to their college search process appropriately.  Numbers aren’t helpful if you don’t understand their reference.  Here I break down testing statistics: questions to ask to be sure you understand the numbers and how to use the numbers once you understand them.     What’s your average SAT/ACT?  The answer to the above question is not helpful to prospective students.  Why?  First off, averages are susceptible to outliers.  Take the example below:  I have 5 students and their ACT scores are as follows: 30, 30, 30, 30, and 36.  Then the ACT average is 31.2.  If I go around reporting 31.2 as the ACT average a student with a 30 ACT has very little concept of how their testing fits into the picture.  They can’t see that the single 36 is pulling the average upwards.  Furthermore, there is a human tendency to process averages as a benchmark or cutoff.  I watch it happen all the time.  If I told a room of prospective students the average ACT was 31.2 the student with the score of 30 may think they are not a competitive candidate for admission.  Because of the reasons above and others, most colleges report testing as a range. Some of my students find this frustrating, as if a testing range conceals a benchmark, but I promise you they are far more illustrative.    What’s your testing range?  If I just tell you Vanderbilt’s testing range for ACT is 30 to 34 (or 1360 to 1530 for SAT), then you need to ask follow-up questions.  First, question to ask: does that range represent applied, admitted, or enrolled students?  Testing ranges for admitted students will almost always be higher than testing ranges for enrolled students simply because the highest testers have a greater number of post-secondary options.  FYI:  The ranges above are for our enrolled Class of 2014 ; the ranges for the admitted class were 31-34 and 1440-1540.  Another question to ask is: do you superscore tests?  At Vanderbilt we superscore the SAT and we do not superscore the ACT.  Therefore, the testing ranges we report reflect the highest Critical Reading + Math (regardless of test date) for the SAT and the highest ACT Composite in a single sitting.    What does the mid-50% mean?  The vast majority of the time you see testing ranges reported, they are reporting the 25 th percentile through the 75 th percentile, or the mid-50%.  Vanderbilt example: our Class of 2014 ACT mid-50% is 30-34.  Of our 1600 freshmen, 800 of those students have scores that fall at or between a 30 and 34; 400 students scored either a 35 or 36 on the exam and 400 scored 29 or below.  Reporting with ranges is helpful because outliers have less influence.  Additionally, prospective students have a broader understanding of the entire pool with the mid-50%.    I have a 29 on the ACT, am I a competitive applicant?  The answer to that question is the dreaded ‘I don’t know’.  Ranges are instructive because they help prospective students recognize we consider a wide swath of test scores.  There is no cut-off/benchmark/requirement.  There is also no formula or weight assigned to standardized testing at Vanderbilt.  We read applications in a holistic manner , looking at every piece of the puzzle.  Therefore, I won’t know if a student with a 29 ACT is a competitive applicant until I read the other chapters to their story.  Conversely, a student possessing a 35 or 36 on the ACT may look competitive from a testing perspective, but still not receive admission due to other factors.  No, seriously, am I a competitive applicant?  We read holistically, but I’m human and I understand that the testing profile is a convenient numerical way to gauge your competitiveness as an applicant.  Here’s what I tell my students: if you’re within the mid-50% you have a good foundation to your application (but remember there are many other pieces to the puzzle).  If you have a test score above our mid-50%, you have a great foundation.  Don’t slack on the rest of the application or you may not be happy with the result; also, if you have those great scores PLUS a great application we may chase you with merit money.  Finally, if you have a test score below our mid-50%, not all hope is lost!  A quarter of our current freshman class scored below that number and they’re on campus now.  However, with that lower test score, you’ve got to shine on the rest of the application.

I am counting down the days until decisions are mailed, and your posts definitely make it easier by getting more insight into the process! Keep posting :)    David   December 10th, 2010  How much weight does the essay have in the application process?  I understand you want to hear the voice of the applicant, but what if the student failed to really choose an “interesting” topic or something that allowed them to stand out from the rest of the pool?  As long as the grammar and spelling is correct will the counselor deny an applicant based on a weaker essay?  Thank you for your response.    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  David:  There is no weight to the essay.  We have no weights at all in the process. For this reason a student can write a less-than-enthralling essay and still receive admission.  Sam, who I described in a previous post , did not have an essay topic that popped out at me, but he had amazing letters of recommendation.  The x-factor can be different for every student.    Elisa   December 10th, 2010  I have heard that some letters of acceptances will be mailed for ED1 candidates as early as today.  Can you tell me if that is occurring, or are you on track to mail every letter on December 15th, as previously posted? Thank you.    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  Elisa:  All of the letters are going out at the same time.  Right now it looks as if they will mail on either the evening of the 14th or the morning of the 15th.  They’re definitely not going out today!    David   December 10th, 2010  I had heard from several Vanderbilt students that they (in the past) received email acceptances.  Was that the case and is there any chance that we will hear online or phone, this year?    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  David: We do not release decisions via email unless the applicant is currently living outside of the United States.  Students cannot learn of their decisions via phone until December 21st.    Amber   December 10th, 2010  All this waiting is definitely making me nauseous. If it weren’t so obviously psychological I would strongly embrace the Pepto Bismol.    Sarah   December 10th, 2010  Of all of your students you have had for ED1, about how many have you accepted?    Kylie   December 10th, 2010  Sarah: We will publish these numbers at the close of Early Decision in February.    hugh   December 10th, 2010  do i still have a chance if my TOEFL is 95, which is below the minimum requirement?    Kylie   December 12th, 2010  Hugh: We will give every application a holistic review, but generally we are looking for TOEFL scores at 100 or above.    Hannah   December 11th, 2010  Thanks so much! This blog is helping me keep calm until ED1 decisions are mailed! This was also a helpful insight into what test scores really mean, how I fit into the numbers and how y’all view numbers!    Gibson   December 12th, 2010  So when should we expect our letters with our decision? On the 15th? Or later?    Christa   December 13th, 2010  Do Regular Decision applicants who turn in their apps. early find out any sooner than last-minute Regular Decisions?  Thanks!    Kylie   December 13th, 2010  Christa: No.  All RD students will receive notification according to our calendar : April 1st unless you are a scholarship recipient.    Sarah   December 19th, 2010  Hi! I hope all is well!  If I am applying for a scholarship, will the credentials I submit for the scholarship be viewed at the same time as my application for admission is reviewed? I am applying ED2, fyi.    Travis   December 29th, 2010  I heard some colleges only look at the English and math sections of the ACT.  Is this true for Vanderbilt?  My highest composite ACT score is a 30.  When I got the 30 I scored a 25 on the English section and a 35 on the math section.  However, on another test where my composite ACT score was a 29, I got a 32 on English and 34 on math.  Clearly, the english score is 7 points higher with the 29 composite score, yet 29 is a worse composite score than a 30.  Should I send my composite score of a 30 or a 29?  Please let me know! Thank you!    Kylie   December 30th, 2010  Travis:  We will consider your single highest composite score.    Robbie   January 28th, 2011  Hello! I commend all of you guys who have earned a 30 or higher on the ACT. I really wish that could be me hopefully in February. My question is, honestly, what are the number or students who have been accepted with a composite of 25? I have a low composite but I have a really good subscore of 29 in English and mid 20s in the other subtests. I also have good recommendations, rank,GPA, and essay. Do you think that I still have a chance at being accepted into Vanderbilt.    Kylie   January 28th, 2011  Robbie:  As much as I know this isn’t necessarily the answer you want- it depends.  Of our enrolled applicants who submitted ACT scores, 25% had scores lower than a 30.  Many different factors go into the application, it truly is more than just numbers.  Thus, knowing your testing doesn’t help me identify if you “have a chance”.  Know that admission is difficult for all of our applicants and I wish you the best of luck!    Christy   August 8th, 2011  In our town my daughter has the opportunity to attend a selective magnet high school or attend a typical high school that offers the “IB” diploma.  Which would be more attractive to Vanderbilt (all other things being equal). She really has her heart on being a student at Vandy! I was going to call and ask, but I stumbled across this blog and thought I might give this a shot. Thanks!    Tricia   October 25th, 2011  Do you now superscore the ACT?    Ryan Burleson   October 26th, 2011  Thanks for your question, Tricia. We don’t superscore the ACT, we just consider a student’s highest composite score. Our position is that the ACT is not as well-suited to be superscored because of the nature of the test. There is simply not as much wiggle room for the ACT since it is only based on a 36 point scale.    julie   December 20th, 2011  Just wondering how merit money or the discount rate is at your school for strong students.  My parents have no savings for college due to loss of a job a few years in the past and the three siblings that will need college after me.  But on a financial aid form their income currently is way too high for aid.  I have a strong resume of school activities, a GPA of over 4 and ACT of 31.  I am top in my school but don’t have an ACT of 36 to put me over into the extreme numbers category. What does the picture look like for a student like me.  I am beginning to think the best colleges are only for the poor and the truly wealthy,upper middle class need not apply? Julie    Carolyn Pippen   December 20th, 2011  Hi Julie,  Our need-based financial aid process if very extensive and takes into account much more than just the parents’ income (things like, I have four siblings in school, or all of our money is in assets, etc).  This is why we actually require two forms – the FAFSA and the CSS Profile – to make sure we have considered all aspects of your financial situation.  Once you have filled out these forms, we garauntee to meet 100% of your demonstrated need, loan-free.  In addition, we do have merit-based scholarships as well.  I highly encourage you to apply for both of these forms of aid, regardless of what you think your package might turn out to be. For more information feel free to visit the financial aid website ( http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/financial-aid-facts.php ) or contact our Financial Aid office at 615-322-3591.    Tootie   January 2nd, 2012  hi i graduate in 2019 and ive been researching on collages and before i decided to do this my only choices were harverd or yale to get my law degree but now you guys are in my options list!

What Advice Would You Give to this (hypothetical) Child? - Higher education - Page 2 - City-Data Forum   February 17th, 2013  […]   From Vanderbilt, read the section under I have a 29 on the ACT, am I a competitive applicant? Understanding the Mid-50% | The Vandy Admissions Blog | Vanderbilt University  And for U Mich: Frequently Asked Questions | Alumni Association of the University of Michigan UM […]    hsuh   February 28th, 2013  what about the gpa    Ryan Burleson   February 28th, 2013  Can you clarify your question?    Mihika   December 14th, 2014  Hello, my Sat score is quite low and my score was 1640. Should i still apply to Vanderbilt University or not? What are my chances?    Jay Watson   December 15th, 2014  Hi Mihika, thanks for your question. The best resource to start with is the profile of our current students (here: http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/profile/ ). With the profile, you can see how your scores compare to our middle 50%. As we say in the post, we can’t know your chances without reviewing the rest of your application (not to mention the rest of the applicant pool). The middle 50% gives you a good starting place to evaluate your application – beyond that, it would be a good idea to speak with your admissions counselor to discuss other aspects of your application. You can find your counselor’s contact information at http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/your-counselor/ Thanks!    Grace   October 2nd, 2015  Does the fact that I have not joined one club in high school lower my chances of being accepted?    Jay Watson   October 2nd, 2015  Thanks for your question. Just as we don’t have cut-off scores for testing, we don’t have minimums for club or organization involvement. Instead, we evaluate activities outside the classroom in terms of depth of involvement, roles and responsibilities, and leadership. We want to know what you spend your time on and what you’re passionate about. That doesn’t have to be a high school club – it could be volunteer work, a business or non-profit you started or work for, some kind of artistic or athletic endeavor, or many other things. Again, thanks for your question!    Jason Knapp   January 12th, 2016  How does a high rising trend look to the committee? Example: Someone who started off with a 3.1 freshman year, 3.4 sophomore year and a 3.9 this year. Also I am a volunteer EMT, so would that help at all? Thanks!    Jay Watson   January 12th, 2016  Hi Jason, thank you for your question. A positive trend in your GPA through high school is definitely favorable. Remember that our academic evaluation takes into consideration the rigor of your curriculum – we’re not just looking for strong grades, but we also want to see that you are making those strong grades in classes that are challenging. Your experience as an EMT is also something that will be considered. If that is something you are truly passionate about, make sure that comes through in your application. Again, thanks for your question and your interest in Vanderbilt!    Connor Castleberry   February 22nd, 2016  How much is the ACT writing portion considered? I got a 35 ACT composite score but a 14 for my writing. Thank you for your response.    Jay Watson   February 29th, 2016  Thanks for your question. First, remember that standardized testing is only a part of our holistic application process. And while the writing portion of the ACT is required, the composite score is the more important factor in our process.    Vivian Hsu   April 19th, 2016  As an international student from Asia, I studied high school since my freshman year. English is not my native language. May I have an idea if you will consider it being a factor for lower SAT 2040?    Jay Watson   April 21st, 2016  Thanks for your question. Applicants whose native language is not English have specific admissions requirements. You should check our requirements for international students page at http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/apply/international.php     Harrison   May 3rd, 2016  How much does the score of your essay on an ACT affect the admissions process? For example, I got a 35 composite ACT score but I messed up the essay and only got an 18 on the essay. Also, I have a 750 on SAT English section. If i were to send both SAT and ACT scores, do I need to worry about the essay score or do you think the low essay score might be disregarded considering my admissions essays and high SAT English score? Thanks!    Jay Watson   May 11th, 2016  Thanks for your question, Harrison. Beginning with admission for the Class of 2021, the writing section of the ACT and the Essay section of the SAT are not required. You can also talk more thoroughly about your individual testing with your Vanderbilt admissions counselor. Thanks.    Cristina   September 6th, 2016  I have a question regarding gpa. Do you guys count the weighted gpa or unweighted gpa? Also, I volunteer at the Audobon Center, which works with environmental matters and what I want to major in is environmental science and I took AP Environmental Science and passed with a 4, would this favor me when it comes to admissions?    Jay Watson   September 20th, 2016  Hi Cristina, thanks for your questions. Regarding GPA, we evaluate based on what your high school reports on your official transcript. And, yes, we do consider your “fit” for the academic school to which you are applying, and your academic record and outside involvement are certainly considered. Again, thanks for your interest.

To see the real-time graph and calculate your chances of getting in, use this free tool from Cappex .   ​Discussion of Vanderbilt's Admissions Standards Vanderbilt is one of the most selective universities in the United States. To get in, applicants are going to need grades and standardized test scores that are well above average. In the graph above, the blue and green dots represent accepted students. As you can see, most successful Vanderbilt applicants had averages in the "A" range, SAT scores (RW+M) of about 1300 or higher, and ACT composite scores of 28 or higher. A large number of applicants had 4.0 GPAs. Clearly the higher your grades and test scores, the better your chance of an acceptance letter. Keep in mind that there are a significant number of red and yellow dots (rejected and waitlisted students) mixed in with the green and blue. Many students with grades and test scores that were on target for Vanderbilt did not get in. Note also that a few students were accepted with test scores and grades below the norm. This is because Vanderbilt, like many of the country's most selective colleges, has holistic admissions . The folks in the admissions office are interested in much more than raw numbers. Rigorous high school courses , strong extracurricular involvement , glowing letters of recommendation , and a winning application essay are all important parts of the Vanderbilt's admissions equation. Admissions Data (2016) Percent of Applicants Admitted: 11 percent Test Scores: 25th / 75th Percentile SAT Critical Reading: 700 / 790 SAT Math: 720 / 800 ACT Composite: 32 / 35 ACT English: 32 / 35 ACT Math: 30 / 35               Rejection and Waitlist Data for Vanderbilt University                 Rejection and waitlist data for Vanderbilt University.
Data courtesy of Cappex.   When we strip away the blue and green acceptance data from the scattergraph, we get a much better view of Vanderbilt's selectivity. Many students with 4.0 GPAs and high standardized test scores get rejected. No matter how strong an applicant you are, you should consider Vanderbilt a reach school . Why Does Vanderbilt Reject Strong Students? The painful reality with Vanderbilt University is that the school must reject many students who are perfectly well qualified to attend. The university attracts strong students, and with over 32,000 applicants for fewer than 2,000 positions in the incoming class, the math isn't in an applicant's favor. The school's selectivity is why applicants need to focus on more than grades and test scores. The admissions folks at Vanderbilt are looking for impressive students who are likely to contribute to the campus community in meaningful ways. An applicant's leadership experience, community service, and extracurricular accomplishments need to suggest that he or she brings value to the community.

In the South, popular options include Emory University , Tulane University , and Rice University . Among the Ivies, Princeton University and Yale University tend to capture the interest of Vanderbilt applicants.

If you're also looking at public university options, be sure to consider the University of Virginia and UNC at Chapel Hill . These universities are slightly less selective than the smaller private universities listed above, but keep in mind that the admissions bar tends to be higher for out-of-state applicants than for in-state applicants.

Founded in 1873, it was named in honor of shipping and rail magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt , who provided the school its initial $1 million endowment despite having never been to the South . Vanderbilt hoped that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the Civil War . [6]  Vanderbilt enrolls approximately 12,600 students from all 50 U.S. states and over 100 foreign countries in four undergraduate and six graduate and professional schools . The university is in the process of converting its residence halls into an academic residential college system. [7] [8] Several research centers and institutes are affiliated with the university, including the Vanderbilt Institute for Public Policy Studies, Freedom Forum  First Amendment Center , and Dyer Observatory . Vanderbilt University Medical Center , formerly part of the university became a separate institution in 2016. With the exception of the off-campus observatory and the Institute, all of the university's facilities are situated on its 330-acre (1.3 km 2 ) campus in the heart of Nashville, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from downtown. Despite its urban surroundings, the campus itself is a national arboretum and features over 300 different species of trees and shrubs.  The Fugitives and Southern Agrarians were based at the university in the first half of the 20th century and helped revive Southern literature among others. [9] [10] The Jean and Alexander Heard Library , the campus library system, contains over 6.2 million items across nine libraries and stands as one of the nation's top research libraries. [11]  Vanderbilt Television News Archive holds the most extensive collection of television news coverage in the world, with over 40,000 hours of content. [12] BioVU, Vanderbilt's DNA databank, is one of the largest of its kind in the world, running over 200 ongoing projects and holding over 225,000 samples. [13] Additionally, Vanderbilt's Institute for Space and Defense Electronics , the largest of its type in the world, provides integral support to several companies, agencies, and governmental units, including Boeing , NASA , and the United States Department of Defense . [14]  Vanderbilt has many distinguished alumni, including 21 current and former members of the United States Congress , 12 governors, seven billionaires, three Nobel Prize laureates, two Vice Presidents of the United States , and a U.S. Supreme Court Justice . Other notable alumni include Rhodes Scholars , Pulitzer Prize winners, Emmy Award winners, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, heads of state and other leaders in foreign government, academics, musicians, professional athletes, and Olympians . [15] [16] [17] [18] Vanderbilt has more than 139,000 alumni, with 40 alumni clubs established worldwide. [19]  Vanderbilt is a founding member of the Southeastern Conference and has been the conference's only private school for a half-century.

[21] Following lobbying by Nashville bishop Holland Nimmons McTyeire , the author of an essay about black slavery whose father was "a cotton planter and a slaveholder" in South Carolina , [22] church leaders voted to found "The Central University of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South" in Nashville in 1872. [21] [23] However, lack of funds and the ravaged state of the Reconstruction Era South delayed the opening of the college. [21]  The following year, McTyeire stayed at the New York City residence of Cornelius Vanderbilt , whose second wife was Frank Armstrong Crawford Vanderbilt (1839–1885), a cousin of McTyeire's wife, Amelia Townsend McTyeire (1827–1891); both women were from Mobile, Alabama . [24] [25] [26] The McTyeires had met at St. Francis Street Methodist Church in Mobile. [24] Cornelius Vanderbilt, who was the wealthiest man in the United States at the time, was considering philanthropy as he was at an advanced age. He had been planning to establish a university on Staten Island , New York , in honor of his mother. [21] However, McTyeire convinced him to donate $500,000 to endow Central University in order to "contribute to strengthening the ties which should exist between all sections of our common country." [21] [27]     Memorial Hall    The endowment was eventually increased to $1 million (roughly $19,973,867 in 2015 dollars [28] ) and would be only one of two philanthropic causes financially supported by Vanderbilt. Though he never expressed any desire that the university be named after himself, [21] McTyeire and his fellow trustees rechristened the school in his honor. Vanderbilt died in 1877 without seeing the school named after him. [21] [29] They acquired land formerly owned by Texas Senator John Boyd (who chose to patronize the establishment of Trinity University , a Presbyterian university in San Antonio, Texas instead), later inherited by his granddaughter and her husband, Confederate Congressman  Henry S. Foote , who had built Old Central, a house still standing on campus. [30]  One of the founding trustees, Hezekiah William Foote , was a Confederate veteran and the owner of four plantations in Mississippi , including Mount Holly . [31] The Treasurer of the Board of Trust from 1872 to 1875, Alexander Little Page Green , whose portrait hangs in Kirkland Hall, [32] was a Methodist preacher and a former slave owner. [33] [34] His son-in-law, Robert A. Young , was a Methodist minister who served as the Financial Secretary on the Board of Trust from 1874 to 1882, retiring from the board in 1902. [35]  The first building, Main Building, later known as Kirkland Hall, was designed by William Crawford Smith , a Confederate veteran who also designed The Parthenon ; its construction began in 1874. [35] [36] In the fall of 1875, about 200 students enrolled at Vanderbilt, and in October the university was dedicated. [21] Bishop McTyeire was named Chairman of the Board of Trust for life by Vanderbilt as a stipulation of his endowment. [21] McTyeire named Landon Garland (1810–1895), his mentor from Randolph-Macon College in Virginia and then- Chancellor of the University of Mississippi , as chancellor. Garland shaped the school's structure and hired the school's faculty, many of whom were renowned scholars in their respective fields. [27] However, most of this faculty left after disputes with Bishop McTyeire, including over pay rates. [21] When the first fraternity chapter, Phi Delta Theta , was established on campus in 1876, it was shut down by the faculty, only to be reestablished as a secret society in 1877. [37] Meanwhile, Old Gym , designed by Dutch-born architect Peter J. Williamson , was built in 1879–1880. [36] By 1883, the Board of Trust passed a resolution allowing fraternities on campus, and more chapters were established in 1884. [37]  Split with the Methodist Church [ edit ]     Bishop Holland McTyeire    During the first 40 years, the Board of Trust, and therefore the university, was under the control of the General Conference (the governing body) of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South . [21] Tension grew between the university administration and the Conference over the future of the school, particularly over the methods by which members of the Vanderbilt Board of Trust would be chosen, and the extent that non-Methodists could teach at the school. [21]  Conflicts escalated after James H. Kirkland was appointed chancellor in 1893. [21] Then the Southern Methodist Church congregations raised just $50,000 in a campaign to raise $300,000. [21]  After the Tennessee Centennial Exposition of 1897, a statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt, designed by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Moretti , [38] was moved from the grounds of the Parthenon to the Vanderbilt campus. [39]  In 1905, Kirkland Hall burnt down, only to be rebuilt shortly after. [36] Meanwhile, the Board of Trust voted to limit Methodist representation on the board to just five bishops. [21] Former faculty member and bishop Elijah Hoss led a group attempting to assert Methodist control. [21] In 1910, the board refused to seat three Methodist bishops. [21] The Methodist Church took the issue to court and won at the local level. On March 21, 1914, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that the Commodore, and not the Methodist Church, was the university's founder and that the board could therefore seat whomever it wished. [21] The General Conference in 1914 voted 151 to 140 to sever its ties with Vanderbilt; it also voted to establish a new university, Southern Methodist University , and to greatly expand Emory University . [21] [40]  Colonel Edmund William Cole , the treasurer of the board of trust, was a Confederate veteran and a railroad executive. [41] [42] He is the namesake of the annual Cole Lecture; his marble bust and his wife's portrait can be seen in Kirkland Hall. [42] [43] His son, Whitefoord Russell Cole , who was the chairman of the board of trust from 1915 to 1934, defended chancellor Kirkland's decision to split with the Methodist Church. [44] [45] His portrait hangs in Kirkland Hall, and he is the namesake of Cole Hall, completed in 1949. [45]      Main Campus, looking toward West End Avenue    1920s through World War II [ edit ]  In the 1920s and 1930s, Vanderbilt University hosted two partly overlapping groups of scholars who had a large impact on American thought and letters: the Fugitives and the Agrarians . [21] Meanwhile, Frank C. Rand , who served as the President and later Chairman of the International Shoe Company , donated US$150,000 to the university in 1925; [46] Rand Hall was subsequently named for him.  In 1933, the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated $50,000 (roughly $925,166 in 2015 dollars [28] ) for the construction of Confederate Memorial Hall , designed by architect Henry C. Hibbs . [47] It was completed in 1935. [47]  In the 1930s, Ernest William Goodpasture and his colleagues in the School of Medicine invented methods for cultivating viruses and rickettsiae in fertilized chicken eggs. [48] This work made possible the production of vaccines against chicken pox , smallpox , yellow fever , typhus , Rocky mountain spotted fever and other diseases caused by agents that only propagate in living cells. [48]  Alfred Blalock , Professor of Surgery, and his assistant Vivian Thomas identified a decrease in blood volume and fluid loss outside the vascular bed as a key factor in traumatic shock and pioneered the use of replacement fluids for its treatment. [49] This treatment saved countless lives in World War II , [49] during which Vanderbilt was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. [50]  Shortly after the war, from 1945 to 1947, researchers at Vanderbilt University conducted an experiment funded by the Rockefeller Foundation where they gave 800 pregnant women radioactive iron [51] [52] [53] without their consent. [52] [53] In a lawsuit the women received US$9.1 million from Vanderbilt University and US$900,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1998. [52]  1950s and 1960s [ edit ]     Old Mechanical, now part of The Owen Graduate School of Management    In 1953, the School of Religion admitted the first African-American student to the university. [54] In 1960, the School of Religion expelled a student who was one of the leaders of the emerging civil rights movement, James Lawson . [55]  James Geddes Stahlman , a Vanderbilt trustee who owned the Nashville Banner , published misleading stories which suggested Lawson had incited others to "violate the law" and led to his expulsion. [55] Dean J. Robert Nelson resigned in protest. [56] Nevertheless, Chancellor Harvie Branscomb enforced the decision, and remained unapologetic as late as 1980. [55] The school was placed on probation for a year by the American Association of Theological Schools , and the power of trustees was curtailed. [55] The university took Stahlman's $5 million donation in 1972-1973, [57] and named a professorship in his honor. [58] In 2005, Lawson was re-hired as a Distinguished University Professor for the 2006–2007 academic year, and named a Distinguished Alumnus for his achievements. [59]  The Vanderbilt Board of Trust in May 1962 voted to accept African Americans in all schools, and the first black undergraduates entered the school in the fall of 1964. [54] The university drew national attention in 1966 when it recruited Perry Wallace , the first African American to play varsity basketball in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). [60] Wallace, from Nashville, played varsity basketball for Vanderbilt from 1967 to 1970, and faced considerable opposition from segregationists when playing at other SEC venues. [61] In 2004, a student-led drive to retire Wallace's jersey finally succeeded. [61] [a]  1970s to present [ edit ]     Vanderbilt University police car.    In 1979, Vanderbilt acquired Peabody College , then called the "George Peabody College for Teachers", residing on 53 acres adjacent to the university. [65] In the early 1980s, Vanderbilt University was a financial backer of the Corrections Corporation of America prior to its IPO. [66] [67]  In 2001, the university determined to remodel the undergraduate experience by creating an academic residential college system. Since then Vanderbilt has been constructing new buildings and renovating existing structures to support the college system. [68] [69]  In 2002, the university decided to rename Confederate Memorial Hall, a residence hall on the Peabody campus to Memorial Hall. [70] Nationwide attention resulted, in part due to a lawsuit by the Tennessee chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. [71] The Davidson County Chancery Court dismissed the lawsuit in 2003, but the Tennessee Court of Appeals ruled in May 2005 that the university must pay damages based on the present value of the United Daughters of the Confederacy's contribution if the inscription bearing the name "Confederate Memorial Hall" was removed from the building or altered. [72] The Court of Appeals' decision has been critiqued by legal scholars. [73] In late July 2005, the university announced that although it had officially renamed the building, and all university publications and offices will refer to it solely as Memorial Hall , the university would neither appeal the matter further, nor remove the inscription and pay damages. [74] In August 2016, the university agreed to remove the word "Confederate" from the building after "anonymous donors" donated $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy. [75]  In 2009, Vanderbilt instituted a no-loan policy. The policy states that any student granted admission and a need-based aid package will have an award that includes no student loans. [76] Following this, in 2015, Vanderbilt implemented Opportunity Vanderbilt, which committed the University to need-blind admissions, meeting 100% of demonstrated financial need of admitted students, and including only grants in awards. [77]  In 2011, the Oakland Institute exposed a university investment in EMVest Asset Management , a private equity firm "accused of ' land grabbing ,' or taking over agricultural land used by local communities through exploitative practices for large-scale commercial export farming in five sub-Saharan African countries. [78] The revelation led to student protests in 2012. [78] [79] By 2013, Vanderbilt administrators had divested from EMVest. [78]  In 2015, Vanderbilt opened a new innovation center, the Wond'ry, as part of its Academic Strategic Plan. [80] The three-story, 13,000-square foot building is meant to serve as an interdisciplinary hub of knowledge for the Vanderbilt community, serving as the location of hackathons, partnerships with the Nashville Entrepreneurship Center, and several social venture programs. [81]  Organization and administration [ edit ]    College/school   Year founded     Arts and Science   1873     Law   1874     Medicine   1874     Divinity   1875     Education and Human Development   1875, incorporated into Vanderbilt 1979     Graduate School   1879     Engineering   1886     Nursing   1908     Music   1964, incorporated into Vanderbilt 1986     Management   1969     Vanderbilt University, as a private corporation, is wholly governed by an independent, self-perpetuating Board of Trust. The board comprises 45 regular members (plus any number of trustees emeriti) and the chancellor, the university's chief executive officer . [82] Each trustee serves a five-year term (except for four recently graduated alumni, who serve two two-year terms). Bruce R. Evans is the board's chairman . [83]  Nicholas S. Zeppos currently serves as chancellor of Vanderbilt University. He was appointed interim chancellor after the departure of Gordon Gee , who left to reassume the presidency of Ohio State University on August 1, 2007, [84] and was named chancellor in his own right on March 1, 2008. [85]  Administration history [ edit ]  Since the opening of the university in 1875, only eight individuals have served as chancellors. [86] Landon Garland was the university's first chancellor, serving from 1875 to 1893. [86] Garland organized the university and hired its first faculty. Garland Hall, an academic building on campus, is named in his honor. [86]  The next chancellor was James Kirkland —serving from 1893 to 1937, he had the longest tenure of any Vanderbilt chancellor. [86] He was responsible for severing the university's ties with the Methodist Church and relocating the medical school to the main campus. [86] Vanderbilt's Main Building was renamed Kirkland Hall after Kirkland left in 1937. [86]  The longest-tenured chancellor was followed by one of the shortest-tenured. [86]  Oliver Carmichael served Vanderbilt for just nine years, 1937 to 1946. [86] Carmichael developed the graduate school, and established the Joint University Libraries for Vanderbilt, Peabody, and Scarritt College. [86] Carmichael Towers, a set of high-rise dormitories on the northern edge of campus, were named for Chancellor Carmichael. [86]  Carmichael's successor was Harvie Branscomb . [86] Branscomb presided over a period of major growth and improvement at the university that lasted from 1946 until 1963. [86] He was responsible for opening the admissions policy to all races. [86] Branscomb Quadrangle is a residence hall complex named for the chancellor. [86]  Alexander Heard , for whom the campus's 10-library system (with 3.3 million total volumes) is named, served as chancellor from 1963 to 1982. [86] During his 20-year tenure, the Owen Graduate School of Management was founded, and Vanderbilt's merger with Peabody College was negotiated. [86] He also survived calls for his ouster because of his accommodating stance on desegregation. [86]     After a fire, Old Main hall was rebuilt with one tower and renamed Kirkland Hall. It is currently home to Vanderbilt's administration.    Joe B. Wyatt was the chancellor who served immediately after Heard, from 1982 until 2000. [86] Wyatt oversaw a great increase in the university's endowment, an increase in student diversity, and the renovation of many campus buildings. [86] Wyatt placed great emphasis on improving the quality of faculty and instruction, and during his tenure Vanderbilt rose to the top 25 in the U.S. News & World Report' s annual rankings for the first time. [87] The Wyatt Center on Peabody's campus is named for Wyatt and his wife.  Gee was appointed chancellor by the Board of Trust in February 2000. [86] After allegations of lavish spending in 2005, the Board of Trust established a committee to monitor his personal spending more closely. [88]  After Gordon Gee's departure in 2007, Zeppos was named interim chancellor. [89] He was named chancellor suo jure on March 1, 2008, by the university's Board of Trust. [90]  Medical Center [ edit ]  Until April 2016 Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) was a component of the university, but is now an independent organization. The Medical Center continues to cooperate with the university and many clinical staff serve as faculty members at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and Vanderbilt University School of Nursing . [91] As of April 2016, VUMC comprised the following units: Vanderbilt University Hospital, Monroe Carell, Jr., Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital, Vanderbilt Clinic, Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center, Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Hospital, Eskind Biomedical Library, Vanderbilt Sports Medicine, Dayani Human Performance Center, Vanderbilt Page Campbell and Heart Institute. [92]     The entrance of Vanderbilt Medical School    Before splitting with VUMC, Vanderbilt was the largest private employer in Middle Tennessee and the second largest in the state with over 23,000 employees. [93] [94] Approximately 74% of the university's faculty and staff were employed by the Medical Center. [6] In 2008, the medical center was placed on the Honor Roll of U.S. News & World Report' s annual rating of the nation's best hospitals, ranking 15th overall in the country. [95]  Students and faculty [ edit ]  Profile [ edit ]     Benson Science Hall, one of the first campus buildings, houses the English and history departments.    As of 2017, Vanderbilt had an enrollment of 6,885 undergraduate and 5,707 graduate and professional students, for a total of 12,592 students. [4] Students from all 50 states and more than 100 countries attend Vanderbilt, with 65% of the total student body coming from outside the South and 8% from outside of the United States. [4] Moreover, 47.4% of the class of 2021 classified as Caucasian, 10.4% Hispanic/Latino, 10.7% Black or African American, 14.1% Asian, and 5.3% other/two or more races; 7.6% of the class is international. [11] As of 2017, the incoming class was 49% male and 51% female [4] In 2017, Vanderbilt accepted 10.9% of its 31,462 freshman applicants, making it one of the most selective universities in the country. [96]  Vanderbilt lets undergraduates choose between 70 majors , or create their own, in its four undergraduate schools and colleges: the College of Arts and Science , the School of Engineering , Peabody College of Education and Human Development , and Blair School of Music . [6] The university also has six graduate and professional schools, including the Divinity School , Graduate School , Law School , School of Medicine , School of Nursing , and Owen Graduate School of Management . [6] As of 2018, Vanderbilt has a student-to-faculty ratio of 7:1. [19]  The university's undergraduate programs are highly selective: in 2018, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions accepted 7.3% of its 30,146 Regular Decision applicants, thus making Vanderbilt one of the most selective universities in the United States and the most selective university in the state of Tennessee. [97] [98] In 2015, Vanderbilt was ranked fifth overall and fourth among private universities in enrollment of National Merit Scholars, according to the National Merit Scholarship Corporation's annual report. [99] In its most recent annual comparison of admissions selectivity, The Princeton Review gave Vanderbilt a rating of 99 out of 99. [100] The class of 2021 included 226 National Merit Scholars and had standardized test scores that were well above average: the interquartile range (25th percentile – 75th percentile) of SAT scores was 700-760 for Reading and Writing and 700-790 for Math, while the interquartile range of ACT scores was 32–35. [101] For students of the class of 2016 whose schools reported exact class rankings, 96.21% ranked in the top 10% of their class, with an average rank of 3.39%. [102]  Research [ edit ]  Vanderbilt investigators work in a broad range of disciplines, and the university consistently ranks among the top 20 research institutions in the United States. [103] [104] In 2013, Vanderbilt University was ranked 9th in the country in funding from the National Institutes of Health. [105] Its Institute for Space and Defense Electronics , housed in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, includes the largest academic facility in the world involved in radiation-effects research. [106]     Peabody Library, Vanderbilt University    Among its more unusual activities, the university has institutes devoted to the study of coffee and of bridge . [107] Indeed, the modern form of the latter was developed by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt , a former president of the university's Board of Trust and a great-grandson of the Commodore. [107] In addition, in mid-2004 it was announced that Vanderbilt's chemical biology research may have serendipitously opened the door to the breeding of a blue rose , something that has long been coveted by horticulturalists and rose lovers. [108]  Vanderbilt scholars have played a role in the development of writing. The Fugitives and Southern Agrarians were based at the university in the first half of the 20th century and helped revive Southern literature among others. [109] [110]  Vanderbilt's research record is blemished, however, by a study university researchers, in conjunction with the Tennessee Department of Health, conducted on iron  metabolism during pregnancy in the 1940s. [111] Between 1945 and 1949, over 800 pregnant women were given radioactive iron. Standards of informed consent for research subjects were not rigorously enforced at that time, [b] and many of the women were not informed of the potential risks. The injections were later suspected to have caused cancer in at least three of the children who were born to these mothers. [112] In 1998, the university settled a class action lawsuit with the mothers and surviving children for $10.3 million. [113]  The university is classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a Doctoral University with Highest Research Activity . [114] The university has a comprehensive graduate program, offering doctoral programs in sciences, engineering, mathematics, humanities, social sciences, and religion, along with professional degrees in medicine, business, law, nursing, and education. [115]  Vanderbilt is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium. Now renamed the SECU, the initiative was a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship, and achievement among the member universities in the Southeastern Conference. The SECU's goals include highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC faculty, students, and universities and advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities. [116] [117]  In 2013, Vanderbilt University participated in the SEC Symposium in Atlanta, Georgia , which was organized and led by the University of Georgia and its Bioenergy Systems Research Institute. The topic of the symposium was titled "The Impact of the Southeast in the World's Renewable Energy Future". [118]  Rankings [ edit ]  Vanderbilt is ranked the 108th best university in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings , [119] and 52nd in the United States by the Academic Ranking of World Universities . [120]  U.S. News & World Report ranks it the 14th best university nationally, [121] and Reuters ranked it the 10th most innovative university in the world.

In its 2018 edition, U.S. News & World Report ranked Vanderbilt 14th among all national universities. [134] In the same publication's graduate program rankings, the Peabody College of Education was ranked third in the nation among schools of education, [135] and the Vanderbilt Law School was listed at 16th, the School of Medicine was listed at 15th among research-oriented medical schools , the School of Nursing was listed at 15th, the School of Engineering was listed at 34th, and the Owen Graduate School of Management was listed at 25th among business schools. [136] Additionally, U.S. News & World Report ranked Vanderbilt first in the nation in the fields of special education , educational administration, and audiology . [136] In 2014, the Owen Graduate School of Management was ranked 30th by Bloomberg Businessweek among full-time MBA programs. [137]  The Academic Ranking of World Universities ranks Vanderbilt as the 60th-best university in the world. Additionally the ARWU Field rankings in 2015 placed Vanderbilt as 18th best in the world for Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy, and 21st in Social Sciences. [138] In the Times Higher Education 2016 World University Rankings, Vanderbilt is 87th. The 2017/2018 QS World University Rankings ranked Vanderbilt 212th in the world. Human Resources & Labor Review , a national human competitiveness index & analysis, ranked the university as one of 50 Best World Universities in 2011. [139] The 2007 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index , a measure of the scholarly output of the faculty of nearly 7,300 doctoral programs around the United States, ranked Vanderbilt 8th among large research universities, and 1st in the areas of comparative literature , educational leadership , pharmacology , Portuguese , Spanish , and special education. [140]  Poets & Writers ranked Vanderbilt's English Department's MFA Program in Creative Writing 18th among the top 50 writing programs in the United States in 2010 and 14th in the United States in 2011. [141]  Fortune magazine ranked Vanderbilt among the top 100 places to work in the United States, the only university on their list [142] In 2017, Money ranked Vanderbilt the 15th best college in the nation among national universities, liberal arts colleges, and service academies [143] In 2018, Kiplinger's listed Vanderbilt as one of the top five private universities in value and one of the top ten overall. [144] In 2016, the university was listed by Travel + Leisure as having one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. [145] In 2018, Niche ranked Vanderbilt the ninth hardest university to get into in America. [146] Additionally, Vanderbilt was the only university in the top 15 on both their Best Greek life and Best Colleges rankings. [147] [148]  Vanderbilt does well in non-academic rankings as well. In 2017 alone, the university was ranked #1 for happiest students, #2 for quality of life, #5 for most beautiful campus, and #5 for best-run college according to Princeton Review. [149]  In 2016, Vanderbilt was ranked the third most intense college in the nation by Business Insider . [150]  Campus layout [ edit ]     Vanderbilt's campus is a designated national arboretum.    The Vanderbilt campus is located approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) southwest of downtown in the West End neighborhood of midtown Nashville. It has an area of 330 acres (1.3 km 2 ), though this figure includes large tracts of sparsely used land in the southwest part of the main campus, as well as the Medical Center. [151] The historical core of campus encompasses approximately 75 acres (0.3 km 2 ). [152]  The oldest part of the Vanderbilt campus is known for its abundance of trees and green space, which stand in contrast to the surrounding cityscape of urban Nashville. [153] The campus was designated as a national arboretum in 1988 by the Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta, and approximately 190 species of trees and shrubs can be found on campus. [153] One tree, the Bicentennial Oak between Rand Hall and Garland Hall, is certified to have lived during the American Revolution and is the oldest living thing on the campus. [153] In December 2015, a hackberry tree fell, leaving 10 students injured with "broken bones and stitches." [154] [155]  Main campus [ edit ]     Bicentennial Oak, facing Buttrick Hall, predates the Revolutionary War.    In the northeast corner of the campus (the base of the fan) is the original campus. [156] This section stretches from West End Avenue south to the Stevenson Center and west from 21st Avenue to Alumni Lawn. The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments of the College of Arts and Science, as well as the facilities of the Law School, Owen Graduate School of Management, and the Divinity School, are located in the original campus. Additionally, the Heard Central Library and Sarratt Student Center/Rand Hall can be found on the original campus. [156]  Flanking the original campus to the south are the Stevenson Center for Science and Mathematics—built on a woodland once known as the Sacred Grove [157] —and the School of Engineering complex (Jacobs Hall-Featheringill Hall). Housing the Science Library, the School of Engineering, and all the science and math departments of the College of Arts and Science, this complex sits between the original campus and the Medical Center. [156] The Vanderbilt University Medical Center itself takes up the southeastern part of the campus. [156] Besides the various associated hospitals and clinics and the facilities of the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, the medical center also houses many major research facilities.  West of the original campus and the Medical Center, Greek Row and the bulk of the Vanderbilt residence halls are found. [156] From north to south, Carmichael Towers, Greek Row, Branscomb Quadrangle, and Highland Quadrangle house the vast majority of on-campus residents in facilities ranging from the double-occupancy, shared-bathroom dorms in Branscomb and Towers to the apartments and lodges in Highland Quadrangle. [156]  The design of the campus and buildings can be described as eclectic, with buildings of various styles and eras. The original 75 acre campus included 11 structures situated along ridge lines with sprawling views of downtown Nashville. The campus gates were located off Vanderbilt Avenue (later to become 21st Avenue). Currently four of the original eleven campus structures still exist. In recent years campus planners have strived to preserve the landscape and buildings of the original core and maintain a compact, walkable campus. [158]     The Wyatt Center on Vanderbilt's Peabody campus    Memorial Gymnasium , Vanderbilt Stadium , Hawkins Field , McGugin Center, and all the other varsity athletic fields and facilities are to be found in the extreme west of campus. [156] The Student Recreation Center and its associated intramural fields are located south of the varsity facilities. [156]  Peabody campus [ edit ]  Directly across 21st Avenue from the Medical Center sits the campus of the Peabody College of Education and Human Development. [156] The design of the Peabody campus was inspired by the classical lines of Thomas Jefferson ’s design for the University of Virginia and the architecture of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois . The National Historic Landmarks program designated the central lawn and surrounding buildings as a historic district in 1965. [159] The Peabody campus is the location of the Martha Rivers Ingram Commons freshman residences.  Student life [ edit ]  Residential college system [ edit ]     Kissam Hall was a men's dormitory from 1901 until it was demolished in 1958. The baths were all in the basement.    In the early 2000s Vanderbilt made a decision to convert its residence halls into an academic residential college system. [68] [7] The intent is to form "a cohesive and growing network of residences that spark creativity, build community, support student success, and extend educational opportunities beyond the classroom." [8] The first phase of this conversion was opening in 2008 of The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons, which brought together all first-year students in 10 adjacent houses, each house guided by a faculty head of house, living among the students in a faculty apartment. It is planned that in their sophomore year, students will enter a Residential College that will be their home for the remainder of their undergraduate years. This residential option expands on the experience provided during students' first year on The Commons. The first two upperclass colleges are Warren College and Moore College, which opened in 2014. [8] They were constructed on the site of pre-existing dormitories known as the Kissam Quadrangle [160] E. Bronson Ingram College, on the site of the former Vanderbilt and Barnard Halls, is planned to open for occupancy in Fall of 2018. [8] [69] Additional colleges are being constructed at the site of Carmichael Towers so that all upperclass students will reside in college. [8] [69] The new College Halls are intended to complement the earlier communities, The McGill Project, Mayfield Lodges, and McTyeire International House. [8]  Two of the new residence halls have received LEED silver certification and the new Commons Dining Center has received gold certification, making Vanderbilt the only university in the state to be recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council . [161] [162] The university expects all five of the new residence halls and one renovated residence hall to eventually receive LEED recognition. [163] The total cost of The Commons construction project is expected to be over $150 million. [164]  Generally, undergraduate students are required to live in dorms on campus, with first-year students all living in the ten resident halls of The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons and all upperclassmen living on the main campus. [165] Exceptions are made for students living with relatives in Davidson County , students with health exemptions, married students, and some students with senior standing. [165]     The Commons Center dining hall    Organizations [ edit ]  The university has many student organizations, ranging from academic major societies and honoraries to recreational sports clubs, the oldest of which is the Vanderbilt Sailing Club. [166]     Sailing Club Regatta    One publication, The Vanderbilt Hustler , was established in 1888 and is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Nashville. [167] In Langford v. Vanderbilt University (1956), a student sued the university for libel; [168] the Tennessee court dismissed the lawsuit, concluding the university was not the owner of the newspaper. [169] Additional student publications include those published by the College of Arts & Science, such as the Vanderbilt Political Review and the Vanderbilt Historical Review , as well as the Vanderbilt University Law School, which publishes three law reviews ; the flagship journal is the Vanderbilt Law Review . The on-campus radio station, WRVU , represents the student body by playing a range of music from bluegrass to choral, with a focus on non-mainstream music. [170]      Occupy Vanderbilt encampment, March 2012.    Vanderbilt also has a large performing arts community spanning every genre of the arts with multiple organizations representing each category. There are dance groups covering contemporary, tap, hip hop, Latin, and Bhangra styles as well as numerous theatre, improvisation, spoken word, music and singing groups including the 2014 Sing-Off champion male a cappella group, The Melodores. [171] Performing arts organizations comprise over 1,000 students and are represented by the Vanderbilt Performing Arts Community, which supports groups by sponsoring performances and awards. [172]  In 2012, students took part in the Occupy movement on campus. They pitched tents outside Kirkland Hall.  In 2016, students took part in the Sanctuary Campus movement, calling on Vanderbilt not to take part in mass deportations or Muslim registries. The administration eventually complied with such demands.  The student body is governed by Vanderbilt Student Government, which includes Senate, Judicial, and Executive Branches. This organization is responsible for the distribution of nearly $2 million in funds set aside by the university to fund student organizations. The VSG passed a bill in 2017 calling on Vanderbilt to divest from private prisons.  Greek life [ edit ]  The university is home to 17 fraternities and 15 sororities as of Spring 2018. [173] As of 2016–2017, 34% of men were members of fraternities and 50% of women were members of sororities, or 42% of the total undergraduate population. [174]  Honor code [ edit ]  Vanderbilt students are required to sign an Honor Code, agreeing to conform to a certain set of behaviors. [175] [176] The honor code dates to 1875. [175] The Honor Committee, later renamed the Honor Council, was created in 1900. [175] The Honor Council comprises a student executive board and representatives from each class year; it enforces the Honor Code and informs members of the Vanderbilt community about the Honor System. [177] Violations can lead to discipline or expulsion from the university. [178] In 2009, a student sued the university over his expulsion. [178]  Dean of Students Madison Sarratt explained the honor code:   Today I am going to give you two examinations, one in trigonometry and one in honesty. I hope you will pass them both, but if you must fail one, let it be trigonometry, for there are many good men in this world today who cannot pass an examination in trigonometry, but there are no good men in the world who cannot pass an examination in honesty. [179]   Student controversies [ edit ]  On November 4, 2010, two anonymous former members of the Vanderbilt chapter, an alumnus and a senior student, alleged they were evicted from Beta Upsilon Chi , a Christian fraternity , for being gay. [180] [181] [182] [183]  In the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2011, four Christian student organizations were placed on probation due to non-compliance with the university's nondiscrimination policy, which requires student groups to accept all students and forbids them from requiring that their officers share the "beliefs, goals and values" embodied in the group. [184] Controversy continued to surround this issue throughout 2011 and 2012, culminating in a proposed state law exempting student organizations from nondiscrimination policies. Although the bill passed both houses of the Tennessee Legislature , it was vetoed by Governor Bill Haslam . [185]  In March 2015, three swastikas , a symbol of Nazi  antisemitism , were found spray-painted in the elevator and basement inside the house of Alpha Epsilon Pi , one of the historically Jewish fraternities on campus. [186] [187] [188] The campus Hillel chapter called it "a malicious attack intended to bring to mind the horrors of the Holocaust , to force us to feel different, endangered and isolated." [189] The news, characterized as a " hate crime " by university officials, made national and international headlines, including in Israel. [186] [187] [188]  A 2015 survey reported that 20% of undergraduate students were sexually assaulted in 2014–2015. [190] Meanwhile, as of 2015, The Tennessean reports that the university is "under review by federal education officials, spurred by six current and former female students who filed a complaint about how Vanderbilt has handled cases of sexual misconduct." [190]  In April 2016 and June 2016, two former Vanderbilt football players were found guilty of charges related to the videotaped rape of an unconscious woman in a dorm room. [191] Cory Batey was convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual battery, facilitation of aggravated rape, and attempted aggravated rape, [192] while Brandon Vandenburg was convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual battery, and unlawful photography. [191] [193] The two are among four former football players charged with crimes related to the case. [194]  Athletics [ edit ]  Main article: Vanderbilt Commodores     Vanderbilt's basketball teams play in Memorial Gymnasium.    Vanderbilt is a charter member of the Southeastern Conference and for a half-century has been the conference's only private school. [195] The university fields six men's and nine women's intercollegiate teams. [196] [197] With fewer than 6,900 undergraduates, the school is also the smallest in the conference; the SEC's next-smallest school, the University of Mississippi , has nearly twice as many undergraduate students. Additionally, the school has outside conference memberships in two women's sports that the SEC does not sponsor. The women's lacrosse team plays in the Big East Conference through the 2018 season, after which that team will move to the American Athletic Conference . [198] In bowling , a sport which the NCAA sanctions only for women, Vanderbilt is a member of the single-sport Southland Bowling League . [199] Conversely, Vanderbilt is the only SEC school not to field teams in softball and volleyball , but has discussed adding either or both sports in the future. [200]  Men's and women's tennis and men's and women's basketball are traditionally Vanderbilt's strongest sports. Both basketball teams play in quirky Memorial Gym , built in 1952. [201] The homecourt advantage Vanderbilt has enjoyed has been nicknamed "Memorial Magic". [202] The women's tennis team won the NCAA national championship in 2015.  In February 2016, the university was fined $100,000 by the Southeastern Conference after fans stormed the basketball court following a win. [203]  Athletics restructuring [ edit ]     Hawkins Field in June 2007    The university is unique in NCAA Division I in that for several years the athletics department was not administered separately from other aspects of campus life; Vice Chancellor David Williams, who was over intercollegiate athletics, also was university counsel and in charge of other aspects of undergraduate campus life such as intramural sports. [204] Despite fears that Vanderbilt would lose coaches and recruits or would be forced out of the SEC, the university experienced considerable success after the change; 2006–07 was one of the best in the school's athletic history. At one point, seven of Vanderbilt's 16 teams were concurrently ranked in the Top 25 of their respective sports. [205] Women's bowling won the NCAA championship, bringing the university its first team championship since the advent of the NCAA. [206] The baseball team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004, had the nation's top recruiting class in 2005 according to Baseball America , [207] made the NCAA field again in 2006, and won the 2007 SEC regular-season and tournament championships and won the NCAA college world series in 2014 (the university's only men's NCAA national championship). Vanderbilt was ranked first in most polls for a large portion of the 2007 season, and the team secured the top seed in the 2007 NCAA tournament . [208] However, following the departure of former Chancellor Gordon Gee to return to Ohio State University , the experiment was phased out and Williams has officially been given the formal title of athletic director and slowly relieved of his other responsibilities in order to allow him to concentrate on this role on a full-time basis. [ citation needed ]  Mascot [ edit ]  Vanderbilt's intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the Commodores, in honor of the nickname given to Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune in shipping. [209] The term commodore was used by the Navy during the mid-to-late 19th century. A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. The rank is still used by the British Royal Navy and other Commonwealth countries, but the equivalent modern-day rank in the U.S. Navy is rear admiral lower half . Since the term was used most during the 19th century, Vanderbilt's mascot, "Mr. C", is usually portrayed as a naval officer from the late 19th century, complete with mutton chops , cutlass , and uniform.  In addition to Mr. C, Vanderbilt fans often use the cheer "Anchor down!" accompanied by the "VU" hand sign, created by extending the thumb along with the index and middle fingers (essentially identical to the Serbian three-finger salute ). [210]  Notable faculty and alumni [ edit ]  Main article: List of Vanderbilt University people  Public service [ edit ]  Many Vanderbilt alumni have gone on to make significant contributions in politics. Lamar Alexander ( B.A. 1962) is a current U.S. Senator, former Governor of Tennessee , former U.S. Secretary of Education , and former U.S. presidential candidate; he filled the Senate seat left vacant by the retirement of Fred Thompson (J.D. 1971). [211] There has been at least one Vanderbilt graduate occupying a U.S. Senate seat for Tennessee since 1977. Other alumni who are current members of Congress include John Neely Kennedy (B.A. 1973), a Senator from Louisiana ; French Hill (B.S. 1978), a Representative from Arkansas ; Luke Messer (J.D. 1994), a Representative from Indiana ; Leonard Lance (J.D. 1977), a Representative from New Jersey ; and Steve Cohen (B.A. 1971), a Representative from Tennessee.

[236] [237] Four current or former members of the faculty also share that distinction: biochemist Stanley Cohen , physiologist Earl Sutherland , and pioneer molecular biologist Max Delbrück ; [6] Nobel laureate and neuroscientist Paul Greengard was a visiting scholar. Alain Connes and Vaughan Jones , both Fields Medalists , are Distinguished Professors of Mathematics at the university. Norman Shumway (M.D. 1949) taught at Stanford Medical School and was the first person to perform a successful heart transplant in the United States . Kenneth C. Catania , a current member of Vanderbilt's biological sciences faculty, was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2006 and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014; since then, much of his work has been covered in the popular press.

Martin is often overlooked as an SEC integration pioneer because his first season of 1966 was Tulane's last as an SEC member. [62]  At the same time that Wallace and another African-American basketball player, Godfrey Dillard (who transferred from Vanderbilt before playing in a varsity game), [63] enrolled as scholarship athletes at Vanderbilt, the University of Kentucky enrolled two African-American scholarship football players, Nate Northington and Greg Page. Since freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports at the time, players who enrolled in school in 1966 could not play on varsity teams until 1967. Because the football season precedes the basketball season within the school year, both were set to become the first African-American scholarship athletes in the SEC, but Page suffered a paralyzing spinal cord injury in a 1967 preseason practice and died from the complications on September 29, the night before Northington became the SEC's first black scholarship athlete when he played his first (and ultimately only) game for Kentucky .

An ancient tropical sea created Nashville’s extraordinary limestone landscape. From that limestone, Civil War military engineers created the nation’s largest inland masonry fortification. Fossils at the Fort provides a rare opportunity to make vital connections between ancient times and the more recent past.” #vandygram #nashville https://ift.tt/2JpcE7O    Posted on Thursday, April 5th 2018  Tags  IFTTT  Instagram      4 days ago  1 note             Students, faculty and staff gathered Wednesday evening to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They formed a unity circle and shared a moment of silence at 6:01 p.m., the time of the shooting on April 4, 1968, then joined in a nationwide ringing of bells 39 times to mark each year of King’s life. #vandygram #mlk50 https://ift.tt/2EmmnHW    Posted on Thursday, April 5th 2018  Tags  IFTTT  Instagram      5 days ago  0 notes             Class trip of a lifetime: Professor Dan Morgan and undergraduate Andrew Grant went to Antarctica in search of the oldest ice ever found.

We discuss the changing dynamics of American politics over the past decades and the pendulum effect that often takes place in election cycles. Matthews describes each change in the presidency as a reaction to what came before. To him, the election of Donald Trump is no different. _________ Listen at vanderbilt.edu. #vandygram https://ift.tt/2Eedz6V    Posted on Monday, April 2nd 2018  Tags  IFTTT  Instagram      1 week ago  1 note             From 3D printing to state-of-the-art drug development, #research at Vanderbilt cultivates many advancements in #technology.
