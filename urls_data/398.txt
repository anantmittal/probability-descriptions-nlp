Category Cancer A-Z    Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention     Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Risk Factors    What Causes Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma?    Can Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Be Prevented?             Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention             Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Risk Factors   A risk factor is something that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t.  But having a risk factor, or even many risk factors, does not mean that you will get the disease. And many people who get the disease may have few or no known risk factors.  Researchers have found several factors that can affect a person’s chance of getting non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). There are many types of lymphoma, and some of these factors have been linked only to certain types.  Age  Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people.   Gender  Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known.   Race, ethnicity, and geography  In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL.  Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world.  Exposure to certain chemicals and drugs  Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress.  Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it’s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment.  Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below).  Radiation exposure  Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia ,and thyroid cancer .  Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma , have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  Having a weakened immune system  People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk for NHL. For example:   People who receive organ transplants are treated with drugs that suppress their immune system to prevent it from attacking the new organ. These people have a higher risk of developing NHL.  The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can weaken the immune system, and people infected with HIV are at increased risk of NHL.  In some genetic (inherited) syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, children are born with a deficient immune system. Along with an increased risk of serious infections, these children also have a higher risk of developing NHL.   Autoimmune diseases  Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sjögren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL.  In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakenly sees the body’s own tissues as foreign and attacks them, as it would a germ. Lymphocytes (the cells from which lymphomas start) are part of the body’s immune system. The overactive immune system in autoimmune diseases may make lymphocytes grow and divide more often than normal. This might increase the risk of them developing into lymphoma cells.  Certain infections  Some types of infections may raise the risk of NHL in different ways.  Infections that directly transform lymphocytes  Some viruses can directly affect the DNA of lymphocytes, helping to transform them into cancer cells:   Infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) increases a person’s risk of certain types of T-cell lymphoma. This virus is most common in some parts of Japan and in the Caribbean region, but it’s found throughout the world. In the United States, it causes less than 1% of lymphomas. HTLV-1 spreads through sex and contaminated blood and can be passed to children through breast milk from an infected mother.  Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important risk factor for Burkitt lymphoma in some parts of Africa. In developed countries such as the United States, EBV is more often linked with lymphomas in people also infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. EBV has also been linked with some less common types of lymphoma.  Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) can also infect lymphocytes, leading to a rare type of lymphoma called primary effusion lymphoma. This lymphoma is most often seen in patients who are infected with HIV. HHV-8 infection is also linked to another cancer, Kaposi sarcoma . For this reason, another name for this virus is Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV).   Infections that weaken the immune system  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), also known as the AIDS virus, can weaken the immune system. HIV infection is a risk factor for developing certain types of NHL, such as primary CNS lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.   Infections that cause chronic immune stimulation  Some long-term infections may increase a person’s risk of lymphoma by forcing their immune system to be constantly active. As more lymphocytes are made to fight the infection, there is a greater chance for mutations in key genes to occur, which might eventually lead to lymphoma. Some of the lymphomas linked with these infections actually get better when the infection is treated.   Helicobacter pylori , a type of bacteria known to cause stomach ulcers, has also been linked to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach.  Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly known as Chlamydia psittaci ) is a type of bacteria that can cause a lung infection called psittacosis . It has been linked to MALT lymphoma in the tissues around the eye (called ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma ).  Infection with the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been linked to a type of MALT lymphoma called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease . This type of lymphoma, which is also sometimes called Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma , typically occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries.  Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) seems to be a risk factor for certain types of lymphoma, such as splenic marginal zone lymphoma.   Body weight and diet  Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk.  Breast implants  Although it is rare, some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces).

Having one or more risk factor does not mean that a person will develop lymphoma. Most people who have risk factors never develop the disease.  Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors include:  Previous infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection or mononucleosis  Weakened immune system  Age: Hodgkin lymphoma occurs most often in early adulthood (between ages 15-40, especially in the 20s) or late adulthood (after age 55)  Family history: About 5 percent of cases have a family link  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors include:  Age: Most cases occur in people older than 60  Exposure to certain chemicals, including benzene and some herbicides and insecticides  Previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy  Radiation exposure  Immune system deficiency and HIV infection  Infection with HIV, HTLV-1 , HHV8 , or Epstein-Barr virus  Chronic infection with HCV or Helicobacter pylori   Tweet                        Patients    Become A Patient  Patient Portal  Patient Services  Physician Directory  Treatment & Services           Research & Education    Research  Education  Prevention  Shared Resources           Get Involved    Giving  Careers  Volunteer  Yroswell           Roswell Park    About Us  Newsroom  Online Communities  Public Notices  Technology Transfer           Access    Contact Us  Site Map  Employee Access               Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  LinkedIn  Pinterest  Cancer Connect                           Home  Patients  Giving  Blog  Research & Education  About  Careers  Newsroom  MyRoswell                                             Menu  Search       Cancer Helpline  800.227.2345    xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?  svg

Signs and Symptoms of Hodgkin Lymphoma    Tests for Hodgkin Lymphoma    Hodgkin Lymphoma Stages    Survival Rates for Hodgkin Lymphoma by Stage    What Should You Ask Your Doctor About Hodgkin Lymphoma?             Hodgkin Lymphoma  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging             Survival Rates  for Hodgkin Lymphoma By Stage   Survival rates tell you what portion of people with the same type and stage of cancer are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.  What is a 5-year survival rate?  Statistics on the outlook for a certain type and stage of cancer are often given as 5-year survival rates. The 5-year survival rate is the percentage of people who live at least 5 years after being diagnosed with cancer. For example, a 5-year survival rate of 70% means that an estimated 70 out of 100 people who have that cancer are still alive 5 years after being diagnosed. Keep in mind, however, that many of these people live much longer than 5 years after diagnosis.  But remember, the 5-year survival rates are estimates – your outlook can vary based on a number of factors specific to you.  Cancer survival rates don’t tell the whole story  Survival rates are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had the disease, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. There are a number of limitations to remember:   The numbers below are among the most current available. But to get 5-year survival rates, doctors have to look at people who were treated at least 5 years ago. As treatments are improving over time, people who are now being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma may have a better outlook than these statistics show.  These statistics are based on the stage of the cancer when it was first diagnosed. They do not apply to cancers that later come back or spread, for example.  The outlook for people with Hodgkin lymphoma varies by the stage (extent) of the cancer – in general, the survival rates are higher for people with earlier stage cancers. But many other factors can affect a person’s outlook (see below). The outlook for each person is specific to their circumstances.   Your doctor should be able to tell you how these numbers may apply to you.  Survival rates for Hodgkin lymphoma  The numbers below come from the National Cancer Institute’s SEER database, looking at more than 8,000 people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma between 1988 and 2001.·   The 5-year survival rate for people with stage I Hodgkin lymphoma is about 90%.·  For stage II Hodgkin lymphoma, the 5-year survival rate is about 90%.  The 5-year survival rate for stage III Hodgkin lymphoma is about 80%.  Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma has a 5-year survival rate of about 65%.   Remember, these survival rates are only estimates – they can’t predict what will happen to any individual person. We understand that these statistics can be confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Talk to your doctor to better understand your specific situation.  Other prognostic factors   Along with the stage of the Hodgkin lymphoma, other factors can affect a person’s prognosis (outlook). For example, having some factors means the lymphoma is likely to be more serious:   Having B symptoms or bulky disease  Being older than 45  Being male  Having a high white blood cell count (above 15,000)  Having a low red blood cell count (hemoglobin level below 10.5)  Having a low blood lymphocyte count (below 600)  Having a low blood albumin level (below 4)  Having a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or ESR (over 30 in someone with B symptoms, or over 50 for someone without B symptoms)    Some of these factors are used to help divide stage I or II Hodgkin lymphoma into favorable and unfavorable groups, which can affect how intense the treatment needs to be.

This is called the stage. To see other pages, use the menu.  Staging is a way of describing where NHL is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body.  Doctors use diagnostic tests to find out the cancer’s stage, so staging may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient’s prognosis. There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer.  When staging NHL, doctors evaluate:   The number of cancerous lymph node areas    The location of the cancerous lymph nodes: regional (in the same area the cancer started) or distant (in other parts of the body)    Whether the cancerous lymph nodes are on 1 or both sides of the diaphragm, the thin muscle under the lungs and heart that separates the chest from the abdomen    Whether the disease has spread to the bone marrow, spleen, or extralymphatic organs (organs that are not part of the lymphatic system), such as the liver, lungs, or brain   The stage of lymphoma describes the extent of spread of the tumor using the Roman numerals I through IV (I, II, III, or IV). This staging system is helpful for the most common subtypes of lymphoma. For other subtypes, the disease has often spread throughout the body by the time it is diagnosed. In these situations, the prognostic factors become more important (see “International Prognostic Index” and “Functional status,” below). It is important to remember that even stage IV lymphomas can often be treated successfully.   Stage I: Either of these conditions applies:    The cancer is found in 1 lymph node region (stage I).    The cancer has invaded 1 extralymphatic organ or site (identified using the letter “E”) but not any lymph node regions (stage IE).    Stage II: Either of these conditions:   The cancer is in 2 or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (stage II).    The cancer involves 1 organ and its regional lymph nodes, with or without cancer in other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (stage IIE).     Stage III-IV: There is cancer in lymph node areas on both sides of the diaphragm (stage III), or the cancer has spread throughout the body beyond the lymph nodes (stage IV). Lymphoma most often spreads to the liver, bone marrow, or lungs. Stage III-IV lymphomas are common, still very treatable, and often curable, depending on the NHL subtype. Stage III and stage IV are now considered a single category because they have the same treatment and prognosis.    Progressive: If the cancer grows larger or spreads while the patient is being treated for the original lymphoma, it is called progressive disease. This is also called refractory NHL.    Recurrent: Recurrent lymphoma is lymphoma that has come back after treatment. It may return in the area where it first started or in another part of the body. Recurrence may occur shortly after the first treatment or years later. If there is a recurrence, the cancer may need to be staged again (called re-staging) using the system above. This is also called relapsed NHL.   The original source for this material is Cheson BD, Fisher RI, Barrington SF, et al.: Recommendations for initial evaluation, staging and response assessment of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma—the Lugano Classification , published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , September 20, 2014; vol. 32, no. 27: 3059–3067.  International Prognostic Index  In addition to stage, a scale called the International Prognostic Index (IPI) is important in planning treatment for aggressive lymphomas. Researchers developed the IPI based on evidence from thousands of patients with lymphoma. The results showed that certain features can help predict how well treatment would work. Patients are classified into low-risk or high-risk groups depending on which risk factors listed below apply.  IPI risk factors include:   Age 60 or older    Stage III or stage IV disease    Blood test results showing higher-than-normal levels of LDH, a group of substances found in the blood called lactate dehydrogenase    Lower overall health or performance status    Cancer in more than 1 organ or site outside the lymph node region   For patients with follicular lymphoma, doctors consider additional factors. Those factors include the level of a part of a patient’s blood, called hemoglobin, and the number of lymph node groups involved.  Doctors use these factors to estimate the chance of cure. For incurable lymphoma, they help predict how aggressive the lymphoma might be. This index is now widely used to help doctors make decisions about treatment recommendations.  Functional status  To determine a patient’s prognosis, the doctor may also test how well a patient is able to function and carry out daily activities by using a functional assessment scale. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status or the Karnofsky Performance Scales (KPS) are 2 of those scales.   ECOG Performance Status. A lower score indicates a better functional status. Typically, the better someone is able to walk and care for himself or herself, the better the prognosis.   Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction    Restricted in physically strenuous activity but able to walk and carry out light work while standing or sitting, such as light house work or office work    Able to walk and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about for more than 50% of waking hours    Capable of only limited self-care; confined to bed or chair for more than 50% of waking hours    Completely disabled; cannot carry out any self-care; totally confined to bed or chair    Dead     KPS. A higher score indicates a better functional status.   100: Normal; no complaints; no evidence of disease    90:  Able to carry on normal activity; minor symptoms of disease    80:  Normal activity with effort; some symptoms of disease    70:  Cares for self; unable to carry out normal activity or active work    60:  Requires occasional assistance but is able to care for needs    50:  Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care    40:  Disabled; requires special care and assistance    30:  Severely disabled; hospitalization is indicated, but death is not imminent    20:  Very sick; hospitalization necessary; active treatment necessary    10:  Approaching death; fatal processes progressing rapidly    0:   Dead    Information about the cancer’s type, subtype, and stage, as well as prognostic factors, will help the doctor recommend a treatment plan.

You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 8,500 people (4,840 men and 3,660 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.  It is estimated that 1,050 deaths (620 men and 430 women) from this disease will occur this year. The survival rate has been going up since around 1975 thanks to treatment improvements.  Hodgkin lymphoma affects both children and adults. It is most common in 2 age groups. The first group is people ages 15 to 40, particularly young adults in their 20s. The second is people older than 55. The average age of diagnosis is 39. The disease is rare in children under age 5.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. These rates may be affected by the subtype and stage of Hodgkin lymphoma and the age and gender of the patient.  The 5-year survival rate for all people with Hodgkin lymphoma is 86%. The 5-year survival rate for stage I and stage II Hodgkin lymphoma is 90%. For stage III, the 5-year survival rate is 80% and for stage IV, it is 65%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with Hodgkin lymphoma are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. People should talk with their doctor if they have any questions about this information.

Hi all, i'm female, 28 years old and this is taking a long time! At the beginning of November i noticed my lymphnodes were swelling everywhere (groin, armpits, neck, behind ears, under chin). I saw my doctor a couple of weeks later who instantly dismissed me, three days later i noticed a very hard lump at the base of my neck in the triangle of my shoulder. I went back and saw a different doctor and she immediately sent an urgent referral to haematology. Two weeks later (16th Dec) I was seen and the doctor was very concerned as i had also (not realising at the time) lost my appetite, lost almost half a stone in two weeks and was feeling very weak with bouts of itching, chills, fevers and neck pain after drinking alcohol . She wanted to do some tests but after a second opinion from another consultant, he said he wanted to see me in three months (no way mate) he eventually agreed to see me in six weeks and if things were still bad he would do a biopsy. Since then i have lost in total 11lb (i was a slim 8st 4 to start with) have another node behind my left ear which has grown slightly, my left tonsil is enlarged, my tonsillar lymphnode is enlarged and hard around 1" wide, the hard lump at base of neck had grown slightly, groin nodes slightly bigger, 5 or 6 now under my chin and now have 5 behind my right knee as well as all the original nodes. Still not eating properly and having constant headaches. I phoned the try get an earlier appointment but could only bring it forward by a week so i was seen on 20th Jan. He still seemed very uninterested and thinks it's could be an unknown virus that could take two years to disappear. My recent bloods showed a previous episode of glandular fever (it was about 12/13 years ago) that my lympohcytes are low and some abnormalities with my liver (didn't explain what that means). After showing him my tonsil (had to remind him to even look at it) he said he wanted to hold off on a biopsy and send me to ENT first and they may want to take the tonsil out but at the same time booked me in for a CT scan (7 week waiting list) to have a look at the nodes in my chest and abdomen. Surprisingly I had a call the very next day to see the ENT the day after (which was Friday) He checked me out and said if it was a case of just the one tonsil being enlarged he wouldn't do anything but because of all the other symptoms he must remove them to rule out lymphoma, although the nodes don't feel out of the ordinary large there are ALOT of them. I got a letter yesterday and my op is scheduled for this coming Wednesday 28th, to be honest i'm more nervous about the op than the actual results (to me it is what it is I just have to deal with it) Does anyone have a similar experience to mine? Could this just be a virus? Any input would be appreciated, thanks for reading.  Thanks for reading.

Obviously you want a diagnosis, and sometimes there needs to be a little pushing, which, good on you, you are doing. We do have tons of lymph nodes, as the article points out, and once you start being aware of them, it's easy to feel many of them. because we can feel many of them, doesn't necessarily mean that they are all clinically enlarged (again, the article link explains this).  Classical features of both NHL and Hl can include enlarged (generally painless) nodes in one or more locations, substantive weight loss, a high temperature and drenching night sweats. A number of people with HL will experience some aching in their nodes when they drink alcohol, I believe.  A member of my family has had on going issues with lymph nodes and liver periodically for years after glandular fever, so maybe that could also be a possibility that your docs need to eliminate.  CT scan is a useful diagnostic tool, but aside from that, a biopsy of suspect lymph node is the sure way to get a diagnosis. Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system too. perhaps they're going to biopsy that when they remove it?  BTW, my process of getting a diagnosis started in early November, and with all the investigations/appointments (and more than one consultant involved), I didn't reach full diagnosis until the end of January. It's not always a particularly fast path, but there's a lot to be investigated. There ARE things happening, and they don't sound as if they're irrelevant. Wishing you lots of  luck with pushing forward with getting a diagnosis. There's clearly something not right, but quite what that is sounds yet to be determined.

I assume he is doing a biopsy on my tonsil (he is sending it to histology if that's the same thing?) Thank you for the article it is very informative :) I'm not really worrying about it, I don't feel as though I have had things explained to me very well and have found it quite confusing!  Yes the most annoying part is the waiting, it feels like forever but hopefully I will know alot more in a few weeks. Thanks again and good luck to you!

They do seem very interested in your tonsil (and enlarged nodes in this area), and clearly they're focussing on this for a reason, so you may as well go with it. Perhaps there will be clearer explanation once they have sent this to histology and got the results (which is. yes, what happens with biopsies). Glad you have the CT scan booked in too (maybe you could request them to let you know if they can give you an earlier scan should they get a cancellation?).  Hang on in there, and if you have particularly enlarged nodes in a location away from this area and/or the tonsil thing doesn't bring an explanation of all the enlarged nodes, then I would think they will look at biopsying something else (i.e. a lymph node, if persistently enlarged within the clinical sense as described in the article link).

Hi again, i had totally mixed my days up! Didn't get my results until 6th March! Anyway, histology should no malignancy in my tonsils, i'd had slight tonsillitis but that's it. I asked if the tonsillitis could have been causing the symptoms and he said no. I asked if that was now it and i'm clear to go and he said no, he can only rule out problems with my tonsils not the rest of my body (total contradiction to what he told me before the op). I now have to see the haematologist again tomorrow to try and get some answers. I've now lost 20lb, nodes behind ear have grown slightly (there are now three) and groin nodes are bigger. I've lost so much weight i can feel lumps in my stomach and i'm sure i can feel my colon..... I'm wondering if my digestive system could be playing a part in all this, i've had problems since i was 13, abdominal pain after eating etc, also (sorry tmi) since all this started i've gone from a BM at least one a day to every 7-10 days, i'm going to ask for food intolerance tests and a re-do of my other blood tests to see if my lymphocyte count had raised at all or if the abnormalities in my liver have changed/disappeared. Could you advise on anything else i could ask for please? Thank you for being here to dump on like this, i am now leaning more towards suspecting a virus or something similar but i know it's better to be safe than sorry!

Other than that, if a haematologist feels that other lymph nodes are enlarged enough to cause concern/feel otherwise that they are of concern, then a lymph node biopsy would be the usual route. Biopsy would rule out or confirm with enlarged lymph nodes that are near the surface of the body, such as inguinal/neck.  Digestive system-wise - endoscopy/colonoscopy?

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention             Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Risk Factors   A risk factor is something that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t.  But having a risk factor, or even many risk factors, does not mean that you will get the disease. And many people who get the disease may have few or no known risk factors.  Researchers have found several factors that can affect a person’s chance of getting non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). There are many types of lymphoma, and some of these factors have been linked only to certain types.  Age  Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people.   Gender  Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known.   Race, ethnicity, and geography  In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL.  Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world.  Exposure to certain chemicals and drugs  Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress.  Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it’s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment.  Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below).  Radiation exposure  Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia ,and thyroid cancer .  Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma , have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  Having a weakened immune system  People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk for NHL. For example:   People who receive organ transplants are treated with drugs that suppress their immune system to prevent it from attacking the new organ. These people have a higher risk of developing NHL.  The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can weaken the immune system, and people infected with HIV are at increased risk of NHL.  In some genetic (inherited) syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, children are born with a deficient immune system. Along with an increased risk of serious infections, these children also have a higher risk of developing NHL.   Autoimmune diseases  Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sjögren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL.  In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakenly sees the body’s own tissues as foreign and attacks them, as it would a germ. Lymphocytes (the cells from which lymphomas start) are part of the body’s immune system. The overactive immune system in autoimmune diseases may make lymphocytes grow and divide more often than normal. This might increase the risk of them developing into lymphoma cells.  Certain infections  Some types of infections may raise the risk of NHL in different ways.  Infections that directly transform lymphocytes  Some viruses can directly affect the DNA of lymphocytes, helping to transform them into cancer cells:   Infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) increases a person’s risk of certain types of T-cell lymphoma. This virus is most common in some parts of Japan and in the Caribbean region, but it’s found throughout the world. In the United States, it causes less than 1% of lymphomas. HTLV-1 spreads through sex and contaminated blood and can be passed to children through breast milk from an infected mother.  Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important risk factor for Burkitt lymphoma in some parts of Africa. In developed countries such as the United States, EBV is more often linked with lymphomas in people also infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. EBV has also been linked with some less common types of lymphoma.  Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) can also infect lymphocytes, leading to a rare type of lymphoma called primary effusion lymphoma. This lymphoma is most often seen in patients who are infected with HIV. HHV-8 infection is also linked to another cancer, Kaposi sarcoma . For this reason, another name for this virus is Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV).   Infections that weaken the immune system  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), also known as the AIDS virus, can weaken the immune system. HIV infection is a risk factor for developing certain types of NHL, such as primary CNS lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.   Infections that cause chronic immune stimulation  Some long-term infections may increase a person’s risk of lymphoma by forcing their immune system to be constantly active. As more lymphocytes are made to fight the infection, there is a greater chance for mutations in key genes to occur, which might eventually lead to lymphoma. Some of the lymphomas linked with these infections actually get better when the infection is treated.   Helicobacter pylori , a type of bacteria known to cause stomach ulcers, has also been linked to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach.  Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly known as Chlamydia psittaci ) is a type of bacteria that can cause a lung infection called psittacosis . It has been linked to MALT lymphoma in the tissues around the eye (called ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma ).  Infection with the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been linked to a type of MALT lymphoma called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease . This type of lymphoma, which is also sometimes called Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma , typically occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries.  Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) seems to be a risk factor for certain types of lymphoma, such as splenic marginal zone lymphoma.   Body weight and diet  Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk.  Breast implants  Although it is rare, some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces).

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma             Key Statistics for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most common cancers in the United States, accounting for about 4% of all cancers. The American Cancer Society’s most recent estimates for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are for 2018:   About 74,680 people (41,730 males and 32,950 females) will be diagnosed with NHL. This includes both adults and children.  About 19,910 people will die from this cancer (11,510 males and 8,400 females).   The average American’s risk of developing NHL during his or her lifetime is about 1 in 47.
    But each person’s risk can be affected by a number of risk factors .  NHL can occur at any age. In fact, it is one of the more common cancers among children , teens , and young adults . Still, the risk of developing NHL increases throughout life, and more than half of patients are 65 or older at the time of diagnosis. The aging of the American population is likely to lead to an increase in NHL cases during the coming years.

Hodgkin Lymphoma  Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention             Hodgkin Lymphoma Risk Factors   A risk factor is anything that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some cancer risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t be changed.  A few risk factors make a person more likely to develop Hodgkin lymphoma (although it’s not always clear why these factors increase risk). But having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that you will definitely get the disease. And many people who get the disease may have few or no known risk factors.  Epstein-Barr virus infection/mononucleosis  People who have had infectious mononucleosis (sometimes called mono for short), an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma. Although the risk is higher than for people who have not had mono, the overall risk is still very small.  The exact role of EBV in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma is not clear. Many people are infected with EBV, but very few develop Hodgkin lymphoma. Parts of the virus are found in Reed-Sternberg cells in about 1 out of 3 people with Hodgkin lymphoma. But most people with Hodgkin lymphoma have no signs of EBV in their cancer cells.  Age  People can be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at any age, but it is most common in early adulthood (especially in a person’s 20s) and in late adulthood (after age 55).  Gender  Hodgkin lyphoma occurs slightly more often in males than in females.  Geography  Hodgkin lymphoma is most common in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and is least common in African and Asian countries.  Family history  Brothers and sisters of young people with this disease have a higher risk for Hodgkin lymphoma. The risk is very high for an identical twin of a person with Hodgkin lymphoma. But a family link is still uncommon – most people with Hodgkin lymphoma do not have a family history of it.  It’s not clear why family history might increase risk. It might be because family members have similar childhood exposures to certain infections (such as Epstein-Barr virus), because they share inherited gene changes that make them more likely to get Hodgkin lymphoma, or some combination of these factors.  Socioeconomic status  The risk of Hodgkin disease is greater in people with a higher socioeconomic background. The reason for this is not clear. One theory is that children from more affluent families might be exposed to some type of infection (such as Epstein-Barr virus) later in life than children from less affluent families, which might somehow increase their risk.  HIV infection  The risk of Hodgkin disease is increased in people infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS.

The number of deaths was 0.3 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 0.2 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 204,065 people living with Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  86.4%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from Hodgkin lymphoma. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.   Additional Information   More about 5-year survival rates   Survival by Stage  Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is regional or distant . For Hodgkin lymphoma, 15.6% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year survival for localized Hodgkin lymphoma is 92.2%.

Who Gets This Cancer?  Hodgkin lymphoma is more common among young adults and among men than women.  It can occur in both adults and children; however, treatment for adults may be different than treatment for children. Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); these patients require special treatment.

More About This Cancer   Hodgkin Lymphoma    Hodgkin lymphoma  is a cancer of the immune system that  is marked by the presence of a type of cell called the Reed-Sternberg cell. The  two major types of Hodgkin lymphoma are classical Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular  lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Symptoms include the painless  enlargement of lymph nodes, spleen, or other immune tissue. Other symptoms  include fever, weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats. Also called Hodgkin  disease.

Having one or more risk factor does not mean that a person will develop lymphoma. Most people who have risk factors never develop the disease.  Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors include:  Previous infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection or mononucleosis  Weakened immune system  Age: Hodgkin lymphoma occurs most often in early adulthood (between ages 15-40, especially in the 20s) or late adulthood (after age 55)  Family history: About 5 percent of cases have a family link  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors include:  Age: Most cases occur in people older than 60  Exposure to certain chemicals, including benzene and some herbicides and insecticides  Previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy  Radiation exposure  Immune system deficiency and HIV infection  Infection with HIV, HTLV-1 , HHV8 , or Epstein-Barr virus  Chronic infection with HCV or Helicobacter pylori   Tweet                        Patients    Become A Patient  Patient Portal  Patient Services  Physician Directory  Treatment & Services           Research & Education    Research  Education  Prevention  Shared Resources           Get Involved    Giving  Careers  Volunteer  Yroswell           Roswell Park    About Us  Newsroom  Online Communities  Public Notices  Technology Transfer           Access    Contact Us  Site Map  Employee Access               Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  LinkedIn  Pinterest  Cancer Connect                           Home  Patients  Giving  Blog  Research & Education  About  Careers  Newsroom  MyRoswell                                PennLive          Menu          Home              News   open      Jerry Sandusky Scandal     Sports   open      Penn State Football   open      High School Sports   open      Entertainment   open      Food & Dining   open      Opinion   open      Obituaries     Classifieds   open      Autos     Jobs     Real Estate   open      Find&Save     Local Businesses     Follow Us   open     Subscribe         Back to Main Menu    Central Pa.

WHITEHEAD, The Patriot-News Jamie Brenneman, 29, is getting treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Jamie Brenneman was a healthy 29-year-old truck driver who loved to work out at the gym when last December he noticed a lump on the side of his neck.  Thinking it could be tonsillitis or bronchitis, he went to his family doctor and was given antibiotics. They didn’t help. Pretty soon the lump had grown so large that his jaw line on the left side of his neck could no longer be seen.  Within two weeks, a golf ball-sized mass grew at the back of his throat. He cut his food into tiny pieces, but still had troubling swallowing it. Fatigued and easily winded, the Lower Paxton Twp. resident and his wife, Amber, grew concerned.  An appointment with an ear, nose and throat specialist two days after Christmas presented the unsettling possibility that he might have cancer. A needle biopsy produced inconclusive results, which meant surgery in early January to remove a piece of the mass for more study.  Finally the diagnosis: non-Hodgkin lymphoma . “I didn’t know what to think. I never even heard of lymphoma and I certainly never expected to get cancer, especially at my age,” he said.  Brenneman isn’t alone — more and more Americans are finding out they have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer that affects the lymph nodes, which help the body fight infection.  “The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma has almost doubled since 1970. Very few cancers are on the increase to that extent,” said Dr. Roy Williams, of PinnacleHealth Medical Oncology Associates in Harrisburg . “Within non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there are over 30 subtypes, some fast growing and some slow growing.”  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was in the news recently when state Sen. Mike Folmer was diagnosed with the most common type, follicular lymphoma. It usually presents with a painless lump or swelling in the neck, groin or underarm.  “I see new patients with follicular cancer almost weekly,” Williams said. “It is slow growing and very treatable.”  In fact, often patients with follicular cancer aren’t treated at first but are just monitored, said Dr. Elliot Epner, a hematologist/oncologist at the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute.  “We watch for symptoms — lymph nodes of a certain size or impinging on organs, abnormal blood counts or causing major issues in quality of life such as fatigue or night sweats,” he said. “It is not curable, but it responds to therapy and often goes into remission.”  Brenneman has large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, another common form. This type is aggressive, fast growing and requires intensive chemotherapy, but it usually responds well to treatment and there is a good chance of cure, doctors said.  The rise in non-Hodgkin types of lymphoma has been attributed to some well-established factors, such as autoimmune disease, whose chronic irritation can be cancer-causing, doctors said. Other suspected links need more study, such as pesticide exposure.  The risk of getting lymphoma among the general population is 2 percent; the risk for those with an autoimmune disease such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren’s syndrome is about 8 percent to 10 percent, statistics show.  “Nobody really knows why; it has to do with abnormalities of how the B cells recognize our own body. They become abnormal and turn cancerous,” Epner said. “Ninety percent of lymphomas are a disease of the B cells.” B cells, also called B lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell.  The risk from pesticides is not clearly established although the federal government has recognized that Agent Orange, a tactical herbicide that the U.S. military used in Vietnam, is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Epner said.  “In this area, there seems to be an increase in lymphoma in small numbers of people who live near farms,” Epner said. He noted that these people get their water from wells and wonders about contamination. “We need more epidemiological studies to measure the incidence, but based on what I see in my practice, I think there is a link.”  Although doctors don’t know what causes cancer, Williams likens a person’s chances of getting cancer to the three strikes rule. Strike one is a genetic predisposition to cancer. Strike two is something that often can’t be named but could be exposure to something in the environment. Strike three is growing older and acquiring the weakened immune system that accompanies age, he said.  “So in someone with a genetic predisposition — that’s strike one — who is exposed to pesticide on a routine basis — strike two — this could cause cancer,” he said. “Part of the problem is the latency period. Things we were exposed to 10 to 30 years ago may cause cancer because strike three — an aging immune system — comes along.”  For example, doctors used to believe that if young smokers stopped smoking, it wouldn’t harm them years later, Williams said. However, he added, “The people I see for lung cancer now stopped smoking 20 or 30 years ago so we can’t say damage done years ago doesn’t come back to haunt them.”  The average age of diagnosis for non-Hodgkin lymphoma is 66, Williams said.  People who have an autoimmune disease or are exposed to pesticides should be aware that their risk of lymphoma is greater than average, Epner said. For those groups, he advises “blood count checks and doing LDH and beta-2 microglobulin tests, which are not part of the standard panel, every six to 12 months. If they go up, it may prompt further investigation.”  “The good news is that even though the incidence is going up, the death rate is going down. Treatment has changed dramatically,” Williams said. Great strides have been made in treatments, including antibody-based chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation or even use of antibiotics, he said.  Brenneman is currently undergoing chemotherapy mixed with a drug called Rituxan, a class of medications called biologic antineoplastic agents. This treatment finds and attacks the B cells where non-Hodgkin lymphoma starts.  “I am able to work at my health’s discretion, but I can’t be as active as I was,” said Brenneman, whose side effects include body aches, nausea and memory problems. “But the chemo is working excellently and my prognosis is good. I’m feeling pretty confident.”  Written by CAROLYN KIMMEL For The Patriot-News                                                     About Us    PA Media Group    PennLive    The Patriot-News    Advertise with Us    Career Opportunities      Contact Us    Send Us a News Tip    Community Rules    Frequently Asked Questions      Subscriptions    Manage your Patriot-News Subscription    e-Newsletters        PennLive Sections    Home    News    Sports    PSU Football    High School Sports    Entertainment    Pa.

Some individuals without any of the known risk factors may still develop the disease. It is not clear why certain factors may increase your risk, or how a particular factor may affect the likelihood of developing NHL.  Some of the risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be beyond our control, such as age and gender. Our lifestyle choices may also play a role in our risk for developing the disease. Some studies are exploring how a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables may actually lower the risk of lymphoma.                   Understanding risk factors  Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer. Not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss it with your doctor.    Have a question?

You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 8,500 people (4,840 men and 3,660 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.  It is estimated that 1,050 deaths (620 men and 430 women) from this disease will occur this year. The survival rate has been going up since around 1975 thanks to treatment improvements.  Hodgkin lymphoma affects both children and adults. It is most common in 2 age groups. The first group is people ages 15 to 40, particularly young adults in their 20s. The second is people older than 55. The average age of diagnosis is 39. The disease is rare in children under age 5.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. These rates may be affected by the subtype and stage of Hodgkin lymphoma and the age and gender of the patient.  The 5-year survival rate for all people with Hodgkin lymphoma is 86%. The 5-year survival rate for stage I and stage II Hodgkin lymphoma is 90%. For stage III, the 5-year survival rate is 80% and for stage IV, it is 65%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with Hodgkin lymphoma are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. People should talk with their doctor if they have any questions about this information.

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention             Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Risk Factors   A risk factor is something that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t.  But having a risk factor, or even many risk factors, does not mean that you will get the disease. And many people who get the disease may have few or no known risk factors.  Researchers have found several factors that can affect a person’s chance of getting non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). There are many types of lymphoma, and some of these factors have been linked only to certain types.  Age  Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people.   Gender  Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known.   Race, ethnicity, and geography  In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL.  Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world.  Exposure to certain chemicals and drugs  Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress.  Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it’s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment.  Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below).  Radiation exposure  Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia ,and thyroid cancer .  Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma , have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  Having a weakened immune system  People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk for NHL. For example:   People who receive organ transplants are treated with drugs that suppress their immune system to prevent it from attacking the new organ. These people have a higher risk of developing NHL.  The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can weaken the immune system, and people infected with HIV are at increased risk of NHL.  In some genetic (inherited) syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, children are born with a deficient immune system. Along with an increased risk of serious infections, these children also have a higher risk of developing NHL.   Autoimmune diseases  Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sjögren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL.  In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakenly sees the body’s own tissues as foreign and attacks them, as it would a germ. Lymphocytes (the cells from which lymphomas start) are part of the body’s immune system. The overactive immune system in autoimmune diseases may make lymphocytes grow and divide more often than normal. This might increase the risk of them developing into lymphoma cells.  Certain infections  Some types of infections may raise the risk of NHL in different ways.  Infections that directly transform lymphocytes  Some viruses can directly affect the DNA of lymphocytes, helping to transform them into cancer cells:   Infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) increases a person’s risk of certain types of T-cell lymphoma. This virus is most common in some parts of Japan and in the Caribbean region, but it’s found throughout the world. In the United States, it causes less than 1% of lymphomas. HTLV-1 spreads through sex and contaminated blood and can be passed to children through breast milk from an infected mother.  Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important risk factor for Burkitt lymphoma in some parts of Africa. In developed countries such as the United States, EBV is more often linked with lymphomas in people also infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. EBV has also been linked with some less common types of lymphoma.  Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) can also infect lymphocytes, leading to a rare type of lymphoma called primary effusion lymphoma. This lymphoma is most often seen in patients who are infected with HIV. HHV-8 infection is also linked to another cancer, Kaposi sarcoma . For this reason, another name for this virus is Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV).   Infections that weaken the immune system  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), also known as the AIDS virus, can weaken the immune system. HIV infection is a risk factor for developing certain types of NHL, such as primary CNS lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.   Infections that cause chronic immune stimulation  Some long-term infections may increase a person’s risk of lymphoma by forcing their immune system to be constantly active. As more lymphocytes are made to fight the infection, there is a greater chance for mutations in key genes to occur, which might eventually lead to lymphoma. Some of the lymphomas linked with these infections actually get better when the infection is treated.   Helicobacter pylori , a type of bacteria known to cause stomach ulcers, has also been linked to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach.  Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly known as Chlamydia psittaci ) is a type of bacteria that can cause a lung infection called psittacosis . It has been linked to MALT lymphoma in the tissues around the eye (called ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma ).  Infection with the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been linked to a type of MALT lymphoma called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease . This type of lymphoma, which is also sometimes called Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma , typically occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries.  Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) seems to be a risk factor for certain types of lymphoma, such as splenic marginal zone lymphoma.   Body weight and diet  Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk.  Breast implants  Although it is rare, some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces).

Having one or more risk factor does not mean that a person will develop lymphoma. Most people who have risk factors never develop the disease.  Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors include:  Previous infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection or mononucleosis  Weakened immune system  Age: Hodgkin lymphoma occurs most often in early adulthood (between ages 15-40, especially in the 20s) or late adulthood (after age 55)  Family history: About 5 percent of cases have a family link  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors include:  Age: Most cases occur in people older than 60  Exposure to certain chemicals, including benzene and some herbicides and insecticides  Previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy  Radiation exposure  Immune system deficiency and HIV infection  Infection with HIV, HTLV-1 , HHV8 , or Epstein-Barr virus  Chronic infection with HCV or Helicobacter pylori   Tweet                        Patients    Become A Patient  Patient Portal  Patient Services  Physician Directory  Treatment & Services           Research & Education    Research  Education  Prevention  Shared Resources           Get Involved    Giving  Careers  Volunteer  Yroswell           Roswell Park    About Us  Newsroom  Online Communities  Public Notices  Technology Transfer           Access    Contact Us  Site Map  Employee Access               Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  LinkedIn  Pinterest  Cancer Connect                           Home  Patients  Giving  Blog  Research & Education  About  Careers  Newsroom  MyRoswell                                             Menu  Search       Cancer Helpline  800.227.2345    xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?  svg

Hodgkin Lymphoma  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging             Survival Rates  for Hodgkin Lymphoma By Stage   Survival rates tell you what portion of people with the same type and stage of cancer are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.  What is a 5-year survival rate?  Statistics on the outlook for a certain type and stage of cancer are often given as 5-year survival rates. The 5-year survival rate is the percentage of people who live at least 5 years after being diagnosed with cancer. For example, a 5-year survival rate of 70% means that an estimated 70 out of 100 people who have that cancer are still alive 5 years after being diagnosed. Keep in mind, however, that many of these people live much longer than 5 years after diagnosis.  But remember, the 5-year survival rates are estimates – your outlook can vary based on a number of factors specific to you.  Cancer survival rates don’t tell the whole story  Survival rates are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had the disease, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. There are a number of limitations to remember:   The numbers below are among the most current available. But to get 5-year survival rates, doctors have to look at people who were treated at least 5 years ago. As treatments are improving over time, people who are now being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma may have a better outlook than these statistics show.  These statistics are based on the stage of the cancer when it was first diagnosed. They do not apply to cancers that later come back or spread, for example.  The outlook for people with Hodgkin lymphoma varies by the stage (extent) of the cancer – in general, the survival rates are higher for people with earlier stage cancers. But many other factors can affect a person’s outlook (see below). The outlook for each person is specific to their circumstances.   Your doctor should be able to tell you how these numbers may apply to you.  Survival rates for Hodgkin lymphoma  The numbers below come from the National Cancer Institute’s SEER database, looking at more than 8,000 people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma between 1988 and 2001.·   The 5-year survival rate for people with stage I Hodgkin lymphoma is about 90%.·  For stage II Hodgkin lymphoma, the 5-year survival rate is about 90%.  The 5-year survival rate for stage III Hodgkin lymphoma is about 80%.  Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma has a 5-year survival rate of about 65%.   Remember, these survival rates are only estimates – they can’t predict what will happen to any individual person. We understand that these statistics can be confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Talk to your doctor to better understand your specific situation.  Other prognostic factors   Along with the stage of the Hodgkin lymphoma, other factors can affect a person’s prognosis (outlook). For example, having some factors means the lymphoma is likely to be more serious:   Having B symptoms or bulky disease  Being older than 45  Being male  Having a high white blood cell count (above 15,000)  Having a low red blood cell count (hemoglobin level below 10.5)  Having a low blood lymphocyte count (below 600)  Having a low blood albumin level (below 4)  Having a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or ESR (over 30 in someone with B symptoms, or over 50 for someone without B symptoms)    Some of these factors are used to help divide stage I or II Hodgkin lymphoma into favorable and unfavorable groups, which can affect how intense the treatment needs to be.

This is called the stage. To see other pages, use the menu.  Staging is a way of describing where NHL is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body.  Doctors use diagnostic tests to find out the cancer’s stage, so staging may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient’s prognosis. There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer.  When staging NHL, doctors evaluate:   The number of cancerous lymph node areas    The location of the cancerous lymph nodes: regional (in the same area the cancer started) or distant (in other parts of the body)    Whether the cancerous lymph nodes are on 1 or both sides of the diaphragm, the thin muscle under the lungs and heart that separates the chest from the abdomen    Whether the disease has spread to the bone marrow, spleen, or extralymphatic organs (organs that are not part of the lymphatic system), such as the liver, lungs, or brain   The stage of lymphoma describes the extent of spread of the tumor using the Roman numerals I through IV (I, II, III, or IV). This staging system is helpful for the most common subtypes of lymphoma. For other subtypes, the disease has often spread throughout the body by the time it is diagnosed. In these situations, the prognostic factors become more important (see “International Prognostic Index” and “Functional status,” below). It is important to remember that even stage IV lymphomas can often be treated successfully.   Stage I: Either of these conditions applies:    The cancer is found in 1 lymph node region (stage I).    The cancer has invaded 1 extralymphatic organ or site (identified using the letter “E”) but not any lymph node regions (stage IE).    Stage II: Either of these conditions:   The cancer is in 2 or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (stage II).    The cancer involves 1 organ and its regional lymph nodes, with or without cancer in other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (stage IIE).     Stage III-IV: There is cancer in lymph node areas on both sides of the diaphragm (stage III), or the cancer has spread throughout the body beyond the lymph nodes (stage IV). Lymphoma most often spreads to the liver, bone marrow, or lungs. Stage III-IV lymphomas are common, still very treatable, and often curable, depending on the NHL subtype. Stage III and stage IV are now considered a single category because they have the same treatment and prognosis.    Progressive: If the cancer grows larger or spreads while the patient is being treated for the original lymphoma, it is called progressive disease. This is also called refractory NHL.    Recurrent: Recurrent lymphoma is lymphoma that has come back after treatment. It may return in the area where it first started or in another part of the body. Recurrence may occur shortly after the first treatment or years later. If there is a recurrence, the cancer may need to be staged again (called re-staging) using the system above. This is also called relapsed NHL.   The original source for this material is Cheson BD, Fisher RI, Barrington SF, et al.: Recommendations for initial evaluation, staging and response assessment of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma—the Lugano Classification , published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , September 20, 2014; vol. 32, no. 27: 3059–3067.  International Prognostic Index  In addition to stage, a scale called the International Prognostic Index (IPI) is important in planning treatment for aggressive lymphomas. Researchers developed the IPI based on evidence from thousands of patients with lymphoma. The results showed that certain features can help predict how well treatment would work. Patients are classified into low-risk or high-risk groups depending on which risk factors listed below apply.  IPI risk factors include:   Age 60 or older    Stage III or stage IV disease    Blood test results showing higher-than-normal levels of LDH, a group of substances found in the blood called lactate dehydrogenase    Lower overall health or performance status    Cancer in more than 1 organ or site outside the lymph node region   For patients with follicular lymphoma, doctors consider additional factors. Those factors include the level of a part of a patient’s blood, called hemoglobin, and the number of lymph node groups involved.  Doctors use these factors to estimate the chance of cure. For incurable lymphoma, they help predict how aggressive the lymphoma might be. This index is now widely used to help doctors make decisions about treatment recommendations.  Functional status  To determine a patient’s prognosis, the doctor may also test how well a patient is able to function and carry out daily activities by using a functional assessment scale. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status or the Karnofsky Performance Scales (KPS) are 2 of those scales.   ECOG Performance Status. A lower score indicates a better functional status. Typically, the better someone is able to walk and care for himself or herself, the better the prognosis.   Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction    Restricted in physically strenuous activity but able to walk and carry out light work while standing or sitting, such as light house work or office work    Able to walk and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about for more than 50% of waking hours    Capable of only limited self-care; confined to bed or chair for more than 50% of waking hours    Completely disabled; cannot carry out any self-care; totally confined to bed or chair    Dead     KPS. A higher score indicates a better functional status.   100: Normal; no complaints; no evidence of disease    90:  Able to carry on normal activity; minor symptoms of disease    80:  Normal activity with effort; some symptoms of disease    70:  Cares for self; unable to carry out normal activity or active work    60:  Requires occasional assistance but is able to care for needs    50:  Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care    40:  Disabled; requires special care and assistance    30:  Severely disabled; hospitalization is indicated, but death is not imminent    20:  Very sick; hospitalization necessary; active treatment necessary    10:  Approaching death; fatal processes progressing rapidly    0:   Dead    Information about the cancer’s type, subtype, and stage, as well as prognostic factors, will help the doctor recommend a treatment plan.

You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 8,500 people (4,840 men and 3,660 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.  It is estimated that 1,050 deaths (620 men and 430 women) from this disease will occur this year. The survival rate has been going up since around 1975 thanks to treatment improvements.  Hodgkin lymphoma affects both children and adults. It is most common in 2 age groups. The first group is people ages 15 to 40, particularly young adults in their 20s. The second is people older than 55. The average age of diagnosis is 39. The disease is rare in children under age 5.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. These rates may be affected by the subtype and stage of Hodgkin lymphoma and the age and gender of the patient.  The 5-year survival rate for all people with Hodgkin lymphoma is 86%. The 5-year survival rate for stage I and stage II Hodgkin lymphoma is 90%. For stage III, the 5-year survival rate is 80% and for stage IV, it is 65%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with Hodgkin lymphoma are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. People should talk with their doctor if they have any questions about this information.

Hi all, i'm female, 28 years old and this is taking a long time! At the beginning of November i noticed my lymphnodes were swelling everywhere (groin, armpits, neck, behind ears, under chin). I saw my doctor a couple of weeks later who instantly dismissed me, three days later i noticed a very hard lump at the base of my neck in the triangle of my shoulder. I went back and saw a different doctor and she immediately sent an urgent referral to haematology. Two weeks later (16th Dec) I was seen and the doctor was very concerned as i had also (not realising at the time) lost my appetite, lost almost half a stone in two weeks and was feeling very weak with bouts of itching, chills, fevers and neck pain after drinking alcohol . She wanted to do some tests but after a second opinion from another consultant, he said he wanted to see me in three months (no way mate) he eventually agreed to see me in six weeks and if things were still bad he would do a biopsy. Since then i have lost in total 11lb (i was a slim 8st 4 to start with) have another node behind my left ear which has grown slightly, my left tonsil is enlarged, my tonsillar lymphnode is enlarged and hard around 1" wide, the hard lump at base of neck had grown slightly, groin nodes slightly bigger, 5 or 6 now under my chin and now have 5 behind my right knee as well as all the original nodes. Still not eating properly and having constant headaches. I phoned the try get an earlier appointment but could only bring it forward by a week so i was seen on 20th Jan. He still seemed very uninterested and thinks it's could be an unknown virus that could take two years to disappear. My recent bloods showed a previous episode of glandular fever (it was about 12/13 years ago) that my lympohcytes are low and some abnormalities with my liver (didn't explain what that means). After showing him my tonsil (had to remind him to even look at it) he said he wanted to hold off on a biopsy and send me to ENT first and they may want to take the tonsil out but at the same time booked me in for a CT scan (7 week waiting list) to have a look at the nodes in my chest and abdomen. Surprisingly I had a call the very next day to see the ENT the day after (which was Friday) He checked me out and said if it was a case of just the one tonsil being enlarged he wouldn't do anything but because of all the other symptoms he must remove them to rule out lymphoma, although the nodes don't feel out of the ordinary large there are ALOT of them. I got a letter yesterday and my op is scheduled for this coming Wednesday 28th, to be honest i'm more nervous about the op than the actual results (to me it is what it is I just have to deal with it) Does anyone have a similar experience to mine? Could this just be a virus? Any input would be appreciated, thanks for reading.  Thanks for reading.

Obviously you want a diagnosis, and sometimes there needs to be a little pushing, which, good on you, you are doing. We do have tons of lymph nodes, as the article points out, and once you start being aware of them, it's easy to feel many of them. because we can feel many of them, doesn't necessarily mean that they are all clinically enlarged (again, the article link explains this).  Classical features of both NHL and Hl can include enlarged (generally painless) nodes in one or more locations, substantive weight loss, a high temperature and drenching night sweats. A number of people with HL will experience some aching in their nodes when they drink alcohol, I believe.  A member of my family has had on going issues with lymph nodes and liver periodically for years after glandular fever, so maybe that could also be a possibility that your docs need to eliminate.  CT scan is a useful diagnostic tool, but aside from that, a biopsy of suspect lymph node is the sure way to get a diagnosis. Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system too. perhaps they're going to biopsy that when they remove it?  BTW, my process of getting a diagnosis started in early November, and with all the investigations/appointments (and more than one consultant involved), I didn't reach full diagnosis until the end of January. It's not always a particularly fast path, but there's a lot to be investigated. There ARE things happening, and they don't sound as if they're irrelevant. Wishing you lots of  luck with pushing forward with getting a diagnosis. There's clearly something not right, but quite what that is sounds yet to be determined.

I assume he is doing a biopsy on my tonsil (he is sending it to histology if that's the same thing?) Thank you for the article it is very informative :) I'm not really worrying about it, I don't feel as though I have had things explained to me very well and have found it quite confusing!  Yes the most annoying part is the waiting, it feels like forever but hopefully I will know alot more in a few weeks. Thanks again and good luck to you!

They do seem very interested in your tonsil (and enlarged nodes in this area), and clearly they're focussing on this for a reason, so you may as well go with it. Perhaps there will be clearer explanation once they have sent this to histology and got the results (which is. yes, what happens with biopsies). Glad you have the CT scan booked in too (maybe you could request them to let you know if they can give you an earlier scan should they get a cancellation?).  Hang on in there, and if you have particularly enlarged nodes in a location away from this area and/or the tonsil thing doesn't bring an explanation of all the enlarged nodes, then I would think they will look at biopsying something else (i.e. a lymph node, if persistently enlarged within the clinical sense as described in the article link).

Hi again, i had totally mixed my days up! Didn't get my results until 6th March! Anyway, histology should no malignancy in my tonsils, i'd had slight tonsillitis but that's it. I asked if the tonsillitis could have been causing the symptoms and he said no. I asked if that was now it and i'm clear to go and he said no, he can only rule out problems with my tonsils not the rest of my body (total contradiction to what he told me before the op). I now have to see the haematologist again tomorrow to try and get some answers. I've now lost 20lb, nodes behind ear have grown slightly (there are now three) and groin nodes are bigger. I've lost so much weight i can feel lumps in my stomach and i'm sure i can feel my colon..... I'm wondering if my digestive system could be playing a part in all this, i've had problems since i was 13, abdominal pain after eating etc, also (sorry tmi) since all this started i've gone from a BM at least one a day to every 7-10 days, i'm going to ask for food intolerance tests and a re-do of my other blood tests to see if my lymphocyte count had raised at all or if the abnormalities in my liver have changed/disappeared. Could you advise on anything else i could ask for please? Thank you for being here to dump on like this, i am now leaning more towards suspecting a virus or something similar but i know it's better to be safe than sorry!

Other than that, if a haematologist feels that other lymph nodes are enlarged enough to cause concern/feel otherwise that they are of concern, then a lymph node biopsy would be the usual route. Biopsy would rule out or confirm with enlarged lymph nodes that are near the surface of the body, such as inguinal/neck.  Digestive system-wise - endoscopy/colonoscopy?

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention             Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Risk Factors   A risk factor is something that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t.  But having a risk factor, or even many risk factors, does not mean that you will get the disease. And many people who get the disease may have few or no known risk factors.  Researchers have found several factors that can affect a person’s chance of getting non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). There are many types of lymphoma, and some of these factors have been linked only to certain types.  Age  Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people.   Gender  Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known.   Race, ethnicity, and geography  In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL.  Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world.  Exposure to certain chemicals and drugs  Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress.  Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it’s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment.  Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below).  Radiation exposure  Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia ,and thyroid cancer .  Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma , have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  Having a weakened immune system  People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk for NHL. For example:   People who receive organ transplants are treated with drugs that suppress their immune system to prevent it from attacking the new organ. These people have a higher risk of developing NHL.  The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can weaken the immune system, and people infected with HIV are at increased risk of NHL.  In some genetic (inherited) syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, children are born with a deficient immune system. Along with an increased risk of serious infections, these children also have a higher risk of developing NHL.   Autoimmune diseases  Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sjögren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL.  In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakenly sees the body’s own tissues as foreign and attacks them, as it would a germ. Lymphocytes (the cells from which lymphomas start) are part of the body’s immune system. The overactive immune system in autoimmune diseases may make lymphocytes grow and divide more often than normal. This might increase the risk of them developing into lymphoma cells.  Certain infections  Some types of infections may raise the risk of NHL in different ways.  Infections that directly transform lymphocytes  Some viruses can directly affect the DNA of lymphocytes, helping to transform them into cancer cells:   Infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) increases a person’s risk of certain types of T-cell lymphoma. This virus is most common in some parts of Japan and in the Caribbean region, but it’s found throughout the world. In the United States, it causes less than 1% of lymphomas. HTLV-1 spreads through sex and contaminated blood and can be passed to children through breast milk from an infected mother.  Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important risk factor for Burkitt lymphoma in some parts of Africa. In developed countries such as the United States, EBV is more often linked with lymphomas in people also infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. EBV has also been linked with some less common types of lymphoma.  Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) can also infect lymphocytes, leading to a rare type of lymphoma called primary effusion lymphoma. This lymphoma is most often seen in patients who are infected with HIV. HHV-8 infection is also linked to another cancer, Kaposi sarcoma . For this reason, another name for this virus is Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV).   Infections that weaken the immune system  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), also known as the AIDS virus, can weaken the immune system. HIV infection is a risk factor for developing certain types of NHL, such as primary CNS lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.   Infections that cause chronic immune stimulation  Some long-term infections may increase a person’s risk of lymphoma by forcing their immune system to be constantly active. As more lymphocytes are made to fight the infection, there is a greater chance for mutations in key genes to occur, which might eventually lead to lymphoma. Some of the lymphomas linked with these infections actually get better when the infection is treated.   Helicobacter pylori , a type of bacteria known to cause stomach ulcers, has also been linked to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach.  Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly known as Chlamydia psittaci ) is a type of bacteria that can cause a lung infection called psittacosis . It has been linked to MALT lymphoma in the tissues around the eye (called ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma ).  Infection with the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been linked to a type of MALT lymphoma called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease . This type of lymphoma, which is also sometimes called Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma , typically occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries.  Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) seems to be a risk factor for certain types of lymphoma, such as splenic marginal zone lymphoma.   Body weight and diet  Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk.  Breast implants  Although it is rare, some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces).

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma             Key Statistics for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most common cancers in the United States, accounting for about 4% of all cancers. The American Cancer Society’s most recent estimates for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are for 2018:   About 74,680 people (41,730 males and 32,950 females) will be diagnosed with NHL. This includes both adults and children.  About 19,910 people will die from this cancer (11,510 males and 8,400 females).   The average American’s risk of developing NHL during his or her lifetime is about 1 in 47.
    But each person’s risk can be affected by a number of risk factors .  NHL can occur at any age. In fact, it is one of the more common cancers among children , teens , and young adults . Still, the risk of developing NHL increases throughout life, and more than half of patients are 65 or older at the time of diagnosis. The aging of the American population is likely to lead to an increase in NHL cases during the coming years.

Category Cancer A-Z    Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention     Hodgkin Lymphoma Risk Factors    What Causes Hodgkin Lymphoma?    Can Hodgkin Lymphoma Be Prevented?             Hodgkin Lymphoma  Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention             Hodgkin Lymphoma Risk Factors   A risk factor is anything that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some cancer risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t be changed.  A few risk factors make a person more likely to develop Hodgkin lymphoma (although it’s not always clear why these factors increase risk). But having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that you will definitely get the disease. And many people who get the disease may have few or no known risk factors.  Epstein-Barr virus infection/mononucleosis  People who have had infectious mononucleosis (sometimes called mono for short), an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma. Although the risk is higher than for people who have not had mono, the overall risk is still very small.  The exact role of EBV in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma is not clear. Many people are infected with EBV, but very few develop Hodgkin lymphoma. Parts of the virus are found in Reed-Sternberg cells in about 1 out of 3 people with Hodgkin lymphoma. But most people with Hodgkin lymphoma have no signs of EBV in their cancer cells.  Age  People can be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at any age, but it is most common in early adulthood (especially in a person’s 20s) and in late adulthood (after age 55).  Gender  Hodgkin lyphoma occurs slightly more often in males than in females.  Geography  Hodgkin lymphoma is most common in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and is least common in African and Asian countries.  Family history  Brothers and sisters of young people with this disease have a higher risk for Hodgkin lymphoma. The risk is very high for an identical twin of a person with Hodgkin lymphoma. But a family link is still uncommon – most people with Hodgkin lymphoma do not have a family history of it.  It’s not clear why family history might increase risk. It might be because family members have similar childhood exposures to certain infections (such as Epstein-Barr virus), because they share inherited gene changes that make them more likely to get Hodgkin lymphoma, or some combination of these factors.  Socioeconomic status  The risk of Hodgkin disease is greater in people with a higher socioeconomic background. The reason for this is not clear. One theory is that children from more affluent families might be exposed to some type of infection (such as Epstein-Barr virus) later in life than children from less affluent families, which might somehow increase their risk.  HIV infection  The risk of Hodgkin disease is increased in people infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS.

The number of deaths was 0.3 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 0.2 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 204,065 people living with Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  86.4%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from Hodgkin lymphoma. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.   Additional Information   More about 5-year survival rates   Survival by Stage  Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is regional or distant . For Hodgkin lymphoma, 15.6% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year survival for localized Hodgkin lymphoma is 92.2%.

Who Gets This Cancer?  Hodgkin lymphoma is more common among young adults and among men than women.  It can occur in both adults and children; however, treatment for adults may be different than treatment for children. Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); these patients require special treatment.

More About This Cancer   Hodgkin Lymphoma    Hodgkin lymphoma  is a cancer of the immune system that  is marked by the presence of a type of cell called the Reed-Sternberg cell. The  two major types of Hodgkin lymphoma are classical Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular  lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Symptoms include the painless  enlargement of lymph nodes, spleen, or other immune tissue. Other symptoms  include fever, weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats. Also called Hodgkin  disease.

Having one or more risk factor does not mean that a person will develop lymphoma. Most people who have risk factors never develop the disease.  Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors include:  Previous infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection or mononucleosis  Weakened immune system  Age: Hodgkin lymphoma occurs most often in early adulthood (between ages 15-40, especially in the 20s) or late adulthood (after age 55)  Family history: About 5 percent of cases have a family link  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors include:  Age: Most cases occur in people older than 60  Exposure to certain chemicals, including benzene and some herbicides and insecticides  Previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy  Radiation exposure  Immune system deficiency and HIV infection  Infection with HIV, HTLV-1 , HHV8 , or Epstein-Barr virus  Chronic infection with HCV or Helicobacter pylori   Tweet                        Patients    Become A Patient  Patient Portal  Patient Services  Physician Directory  Treatment & Services           Research & Education    Research  Education  Prevention  Shared Resources           Get Involved    Giving  Careers  Volunteer  Yroswell           Roswell Park    About Us  Newsroom  Online Communities  Public Notices  Technology Transfer           Access    Contact Us  Site Map  Employee Access               Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  LinkedIn  Pinterest  Cancer Connect                           Home  Patients  Giving  Blog  Research & Education  About  Careers  Newsroom  MyRoswell                                PennLive          Menu          Home              News   open      Jerry Sandusky Scandal     Sports   open      Penn State Football   open      High School Sports   open      Entertainment   open      Food & Dining   open      Opinion   open      Obituaries     Classifieds   open      Autos     Jobs     Real Estate   open      Find&Save     Local Businesses     Follow Us   open     Subscribe         Back to Main Menu    Central Pa.

WHITEHEAD, The Patriot-News Jamie Brenneman, 29, is getting treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Jamie Brenneman was a healthy 29-year-old truck driver who loved to work out at the gym when last December he noticed a lump on the side of his neck.  Thinking it could be tonsillitis or bronchitis, he went to his family doctor and was given antibiotics. They didn’t help. Pretty soon the lump had grown so large that his jaw line on the left side of his neck could no longer be seen.  Within two weeks, a golf ball-sized mass grew at the back of his throat. He cut his food into tiny pieces, but still had troubling swallowing it. Fatigued and easily winded, the Lower Paxton Twp. resident and his wife, Amber, grew concerned.  An appointment with an ear, nose and throat specialist two days after Christmas presented the unsettling possibility that he might have cancer. A needle biopsy produced inconclusive results, which meant surgery in early January to remove a piece of the mass for more study.  Finally the diagnosis: non-Hodgkin lymphoma . “I didn’t know what to think. I never even heard of lymphoma and I certainly never expected to get cancer, especially at my age,” he said.  Brenneman isn’t alone — more and more Americans are finding out they have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer that affects the lymph nodes, which help the body fight infection.  “The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma has almost doubled since 1970. Very few cancers are on the increase to that extent,” said Dr. Roy Williams, of PinnacleHealth Medical Oncology Associates in Harrisburg . “Within non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there are over 30 subtypes, some fast growing and some slow growing.”  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was in the news recently when state Sen. Mike Folmer was diagnosed with the most common type, follicular lymphoma. It usually presents with a painless lump or swelling in the neck, groin or underarm.  “I see new patients with follicular cancer almost weekly,” Williams said. “It is slow growing and very treatable.”  In fact, often patients with follicular cancer aren’t treated at first but are just monitored, said Dr. Elliot Epner, a hematologist/oncologist at the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute.  “We watch for symptoms — lymph nodes of a certain size or impinging on organs, abnormal blood counts or causing major issues in quality of life such as fatigue or night sweats,” he said. “It is not curable, but it responds to therapy and often goes into remission.”  Brenneman has large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, another common form. This type is aggressive, fast growing and requires intensive chemotherapy, but it usually responds well to treatment and there is a good chance of cure, doctors said.  The rise in non-Hodgkin types of lymphoma has been attributed to some well-established factors, such as autoimmune disease, whose chronic irritation can be cancer-causing, doctors said. Other suspected links need more study, such as pesticide exposure.  The risk of getting lymphoma among the general population is 2 percent; the risk for those with an autoimmune disease such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren’s syndrome is about 8 percent to 10 percent, statistics show.  “Nobody really knows why; it has to do with abnormalities of how the B cells recognize our own body. They become abnormal and turn cancerous,” Epner said. “Ninety percent of lymphomas are a disease of the B cells.” B cells, also called B lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell.  The risk from pesticides is not clearly established although the federal government has recognized that Agent Orange, a tactical herbicide that the U.S. military used in Vietnam, is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Epner said.  “In this area, there seems to be an increase in lymphoma in small numbers of people who live near farms,” Epner said. He noted that these people get their water from wells and wonders about contamination. “We need more epidemiological studies to measure the incidence, but based on what I see in my practice, I think there is a link.”  Although doctors don’t know what causes cancer, Williams likens a person’s chances of getting cancer to the three strikes rule. Strike one is a genetic predisposition to cancer. Strike two is something that often can’t be named but could be exposure to something in the environment. Strike three is growing older and acquiring the weakened immune system that accompanies age, he said.  “So in someone with a genetic predisposition — that’s strike one — who is exposed to pesticide on a routine basis — strike two — this could cause cancer,” he said. “Part of the problem is the latency period. Things we were exposed to 10 to 30 years ago may cause cancer because strike three — an aging immune system — comes along.”  For example, doctors used to believe that if young smokers stopped smoking, it wouldn’t harm them years later, Williams said. However, he added, “The people I see for lung cancer now stopped smoking 20 or 30 years ago so we can’t say damage done years ago doesn’t come back to haunt them.”  The average age of diagnosis for non-Hodgkin lymphoma is 66, Williams said.  People who have an autoimmune disease or are exposed to pesticides should be aware that their risk of lymphoma is greater than average, Epner said. For those groups, he advises “blood count checks and doing LDH and beta-2 microglobulin tests, which are not part of the standard panel, every six to 12 months. If they go up, it may prompt further investigation.”  “The good news is that even though the incidence is going up, the death rate is going down. Treatment has changed dramatically,” Williams said. Great strides have been made in treatments, including antibody-based chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation or even use of antibiotics, he said.  Brenneman is currently undergoing chemotherapy mixed with a drug called Rituxan, a class of medications called biologic antineoplastic agents. This treatment finds and attacks the B cells where non-Hodgkin lymphoma starts.  “I am able to work at my health’s discretion, but I can’t be as active as I was,” said Brenneman, whose side effects include body aches, nausea and memory problems. “But the chemo is working excellently and my prognosis is good. I’m feeling pretty confident.”  Written by CAROLYN KIMMEL For The Patriot-News                                                     About Us    PA Media Group    PennLive    The Patriot-News    Advertise with Us    Career Opportunities      Contact Us    Send Us a News Tip    Community Rules    Frequently Asked Questions      Subscriptions    Manage your Patriot-News Subscription    e-Newsletters        PennLive Sections    Home    News    Sports    PSU Football    High School Sports    Entertainment    Pa.

Some individuals without any of the known risk factors may still develop the disease. It is not clear why certain factors may increase your risk, or how a particular factor may affect the likelihood of developing NHL.  Some of the risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be beyond our control, such as age and gender. Our lifestyle choices may also play a role in our risk for developing the disease. Some studies are exploring how a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables may actually lower the risk of lymphoma.                   Understanding risk factors  Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer. Not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss it with your doctor.    Have a question?

You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 8,500 people (4,840 men and 3,660 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.  It is estimated that 1,050 deaths (620 men and 430 women) from this disease will occur this year. The survival rate has been going up since around 1975 thanks to treatment improvements.  Hodgkin lymphoma affects both children and adults. It is most common in 2 age groups. The first group is people ages 15 to 40, particularly young adults in their 20s. The second is people older than 55. The average age of diagnosis is 39. The disease is rare in children under age 5.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. These rates may be affected by the subtype and stage of Hodgkin lymphoma and the age and gender of the patient.  The 5-year survival rate for all people with Hodgkin lymphoma is 86%. The 5-year survival rate for stage I and stage II Hodgkin lymphoma is 90%. For stage III, the 5-year survival rate is 80% and for stage IV, it is 65%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with Hodgkin lymphoma are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. People should talk with their doctor if they have any questions about this information.
