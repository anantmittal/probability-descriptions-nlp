Mom, dad, son all share a birthday     In a photo taken Dec. 24, 2016, by Luke Gardner with his cellphone on a timer, Luke and Hillary Gardner pose with their son Cade Lee in Baldwyn, Miss. The three share the same birthday.   Luke Gardner, AP        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Luke and Hillary Gardner never have a problem remembering each other’s birthday. After all, the husband and wife were born the same day. And so was their son, 27 years later this past December. The odds of that happening are about one in 133,000, statisticians say. And that’s a lot less likely than getting hit by lightning sometime in your lifetime, which some put at roughly one in 12,000. They weren’t aiming at a joint birthday when their son Cade Lee Gardner was conceived, said Luke Gardner, an assistant pastor at a Baptist church in northeast Mississippi and a student at a nearby campus of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. “I really didn’t even put it together until we got pregnant,” he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. “Then we realized, ‘Oh, wow!’” Using a smartphone app, he said, his wife calculated a due date of Dec. 15, three days before their joint birthday. Her obstetrician called it for Dec. 19. So the couple from Baldwyn, Mississippi, got in some exercise to try to hurry the baby up a bit. The night of Dec. 17, Gardner said, “we went walking” around the parking lot at First Baptist Church of Baldwyn, where Gardner is outreach pastor. Whether or not the exercise sped things up, Cade was born at 10:01 a.m. on Dec. 18 -- exactly 27 years after his parents’ birthdate. “Hillary is exactly six hours older than me,” Luke Gardner said. She was born at 8:10 a.m. and her husband at 2:10 p.m. on Dec. 18, 1989. They learned about their shared birthday before they started dating, while just part of a group of friends who hung out together. “I saw it on a Facebook page first and asked about it,” Gardner said. “I couldn’t really believe it when I saw it. I had to confirm it with her.” The chance of meeting someone born the same day as you is one in 365, explained Tumulesh Solanky, chair of the math department at the University of New Orleans. He said the chance of two people being born on the same day and having a baby on their birthday is about 1/365 times 1/365. “That comes out to .0000000751 -- seven zeros and then 751,” or about 7.5 in a million, he said, which comes to about one in 133,000. Statisticians note that this ignores such factors as leap years and the fact that births are not evenly spaced throughout the year. Gardner joked that if he and Hillary Gardner have more children, they may have to try for December. “If we have any more kids, if we don’t get pregnant in March, we’ll have to wait till the next year,” he said.   © 2017 The Associated Press.

Newborn shares birthday with mother, father Nell Luter Floyd, Clarion-Ledger correspondent Published 11:24 a.m. CT Jan. 10, 2017 | Updated 9:38 a.m. CT Jan. 11, 2017 CLOSE Cade Lee Gardner was born Dec. 18, 2016. He came on his own volition, with no induction of labor or planned C-section. His timing couldn't have been better, since now he shares the same birthday as his mother and father. Dustin Barnes/The Clarion-Ledger On Dec. 18, Cade Lee Gardner entered the world, bringing with him a family trifecta of sorts. He was born on the same date as both his parents, Hillary and Luke Gardner of Baldwyn. (Photo: Special to The Clarion-Ledger) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Pamela and Rod Cadenhead of Brandon marveled when their first grandchild was born — and with good reason. Cade Lee Gardner came into the world on Dec. 18, the same month and date his mother and father, Hillary and Luke Gardner of Baldwyn, did. “We all talked about how they might share the same birthday after we found out Hillary’s due date was Dec. 19,” said Rod Cadenhead, executive pastor of operations for Pinelake Church, which has locations at the Reservoir and in Madison, Clinton, Starkville and Oxford. Pamela Cadenheadl, wife of Rod Cadenhead, just knew Cade would be born on his parents’ birthday. “I just felt it was going to happen on that date,” she said. “I think it’s pretty neat.” Just in case you’re wondering, Cade appeared on his own volition. There was no induction of labor, no planned C-section. “This was totally natural,” said Hillary Gardner, 27, a graduate of Northwest Rankin High School and Mississippi State University who has worked as a real estate agent and is now a full-time mother. Hillary Gardner, whose best friend as a child was also born on Dec. 18, said that near her due date her obstetrician doubted there would be a birthday trifecta. Hillary Gardner took matters into her own hands and decided on Dec. 17 that a long walk might encourage labor to begin — and it did. Weighing 8 pounds, 1 ounce and measuring 20 inches long, Cade was born on Dec. 18 at 10:01 a.m. at Women’s Hospital in Tupelo. Luke Gardner, who grew up in Smithville, graduated from MSU and serves as children’s, evangelism and outreach pastor at First Baptist Church of Baldwyn, was also born there. Cade resembles his mother in facial features and has his father’s hair, Hillary Gardner said. The baby’s first name, Cade, is taken from Hillary Gardner’s maiden name, Cadenhead, and his middle name, Lee, is from Luke Gardner’s deceased father, Lee Gardner, who was pastor at Smithville Baptist Church for more than a decade. Ken Thompson, institutional researcher at Millsaps College in Jackson who teaches a class in elementary statistics, said it is very unlikely for a mother, father and their child to share the same birth date. “There are lots of variables at play,” he said. “To make it as simple as possible, let’s say that the distribution of birthdays throughout the year is uniform, that people are equally likely to be born on any given day of the year. This isn’t necessarily a true assumption, but it makes the interpretation much easier. I don’t know what the true distribution would be — babies are not likely to be conceived uniformly throughout the year — and let’s ignore leap years, which brings another level of complexity. “Given these ideal situations, the probability that a person is born on any given day of the year is 1/365, regardless of the day. The probability of being born on Dec. 18 is 1/365 for the mother, the father, and the son. “The probability of three independent events would be the product of the three probabilities. Thus, the probability of mom born on Dec. 18 and the probability of dad born on Dec. 18 and the probability of their son being born on Dec. 18 is (1/365)(1/365)(1/365), which is 0.000000021.” Wondering what plans the Gardners have for celebrating their joint birthdays? In the past, Hillary and Luke Gardner have visited retailers who give out free things to people on their birthdays, but Hillary Gardner expects that will change as Cade grows older. “We’ll be more about his birthday and less about ours,” she said.

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers   Jack Woida , Engineering and physics education; math hobby. Answered Feb 3, 2016 · Author has 488 answers and 1m answer views The chances of having your birthday on any given day of the year is 1/365.25 or about  0.274%.  So according to this you share a birthday with 0.274% of the people in the world, assuming births are randomly distributed throughout the year. But,. because 50% of these people are male and 50% are female, the chances that one of these people is your mother is half of this, or 0.137%. According to Mr. Google, that all knowing mystical font of information, the likelihood of a twin birth is about 3 in 100, or 3%. So the likelihood that you would share a birthday with a female who was a twin would be 3% times 0.137%, or roughly .0041%. I don't know how old you are.  There are about 7.4 B people in the world today, but let's assume that when you were born, there were only 6 B, and of these half, 3 B were female, and of these 60% were of child bearing age, roughly 1.8 B.  Then the odds that one of these were your mother would be 1 in 1.8 B. So now we combine the .0041% odds (the same as 1 in 24,350)  that you share a birthday with a female twin with the 1 in 1.8 B odds that any given female is your mother and we get one chance out of  43,830,000,000,000 of this happening. Actually I think the odds are probably even slimmer than that, since I thing the odds of having identical twins are even less than 3%. Anyway, that's my attempt at the math.  A professional statistician, smarter than me, may come along and correct me on this. 795 Views Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question Anonymous Answered Feb 3, 2016 Probability of being a twin is 3/100. 1/365 is the probability of having the same birthday. Not considering leap year and a birth day on February, 2. The provability you want is 3/36500. Not very rare. It's estimated to have 360000 child births a day. About 30 kids a day are born with your special case. 291 Views   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Answered Feb 4, 2016 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views I don't think I parse the question quite the same way that the other respondents have.  First, EVERYONE has a mother.  Every mother has a birthday.  So the probability that you share a birthday with your mother is roughly 1/365.  (It should be noted that I am ignoring leap days, but that approximation isn't as significant as is the fact that some days of the year are more likely than others to be birthdays for a handful of reasons that aren't worth discussing here.) Now, as for the twin part, given that you share a birthday with your mother and given that your mother has a twin (of any type), the probability that you share a birthday with the twin is very nearly one.  (It's possible but rare that the twins were born on consecutive days. In modern medicine, it is even possible, but EXCEEDINGLY rare for twins to be born weeks or even months apart.) So, since you have a mother and your mother has a mirror image twin, the probability that you all share a birthday is quite close to 1/365. However... Since the question says "you would share a birthday with your mother and her identical mirror image twin" my answer is zero as my mother has no twin. And finally, if we are to assume that you mean pick a person at random, what is the probability that this person has a mother who has a mirror image twin AND that all three share a birthday, we need to multiply the 1/365 probability discussed above by the probability that a person has a mirror image twin.  That probability is estimated at about 3/4000.  So the result is roughly 2 in a million. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Paul Robinson Thank you for your feedback!

I'm sure his answer is totally correct. You could also discuss the various technicalities of a coin flip. Sure, we might say that there's a 50% chance of heads, but maybe you flip your coins in a particular way, and the head side is slightly heavier than the other, and blah blah blah. It's totally correct to talk about these things, but sometimes it's more of a distraction than anything else. Simplifications are good! The simple answer is this: The chances that your kids would share the same birthday is 1/365 . Your first kid's birthday is July 23rd. So the only question there is: what is the odds of this other kid being born on July 23rd? 1/365. (Analogy: what are the odds of flipping a coin and getting the same thing twice? 1/2. This is just the odds of the second coin flip matching whatever the first one was.) The chances that both your kids are born on July 23rd specifically is 1/365*1/365. This is the first problem * the first problem. Both your kids now have to be born on July 23rd. (Analogy: what are the odds of getting heads twice? 1/2 for the first flip * 1/2 for the second flip. So 1/4.) This is the simple answer that you're looking for. 8.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

And the answer is fairly simple, although you'd have to make a few assumptions for the model in order to keep things simple. First, you assume that every child has a probability under uniform distribution of having a birthday on any given day of the year. Next, you assume that every child's probability is independent of other children's probabilities, i.e., having a child born on September 1st does not effect another child's probabilities. The question illustrates the importance of asking the right question, which is in fact: What is the probability that these two children do not share the same birthday? This is very simple. [math]\mathbb{P}(\mbox{different birthdays}) = \frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \approx .9973 [/math] To find out what the probability of these two children having the the same birthday, we simply say it is 1-.9973 = .0027 2k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Undo   Chong You Quan , prefers a euclidean world Answered Nov 20, 2012 · Author has 69 answers and 193.6k answer views Qiaochu Yuan's answer has covered much ground on this question. I would just like to present the answer in another way and include some of the factors that affect pregnancy and childbirth. We will first cover the math , then some other factors involved in childbirth. We shall use symbols [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] to denote the birthdays of the first and second child respectively. We consider 3 scenarios below, and the probabilities will become very clear. I will assume that there is no prior knowledge of when the children would be born before they are born and that there are no leap years involved here. 1. Before the children are born We have no knowledge of when the birthdays of the children would be (i.e. [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] are undetermined). There are two variables [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] , and each of them can take 365 possible values, so the probability that [math]x_1[/math] equals [math]x_2[/math] is (1/365)*(1/365)*365 = 1/365 . (The multiplication by 365 is due to the fact that there are 365 pairs of numbers that can match i.e. [math]x_1[/math] = [math]x_2[/math] =1, [math]x_1[/math] = [math]x_2[/math] = 2, ... and so on). 2. After the first child is born We now have knowledge of the birthday of the first child (i.e. [math]x_1[/math] is known, but [math]x_2[/math] is unknown. Thus, we have only one variable [math]x_2[/math] left (that can take 365 values), so the probability is 1/365 that it matches [math]x_1[/math] exactly. 3. After the second child is born We now have knowledge of the birthdays of both children, and there are no undetermined variables. So, we know that their birthdays match, with probability 1 . Now we have done the math, and I'll cover some factors that affect childbirth and pregnancy below: 1. Sex . Enough said. 2. Menstrual cycle of the mother Frequent sex does not exactly imply greater chance of conceiving a child. On day 14 of the average 28 day menstrual cycle, the egg leaves the ovary, entering the uterus, and it is called ovulation [1]. After that, the egg would begin to break apart 3 days after it leaves the ovary. It is during this crucial 3 day period that sex can result in conception . However, it must be noted that the length of menstrual cycles and times of egg release can vary (depending on the environment, stress levels, diet etc). For two children to be conceived at about the same time requires that the menstrual cycle somehow happen to coincide within the respective months (say, Nov 08 and Nov 11) that each child was conceived. 3. Gestation period Now, after the child is conceived, the gestation period would be about 9 months (266 days [2]). Boys usually take longer to gestate than girls [2]. About 50% of births occur within the first week of the estimated 266 days [3] (the online tool at [3] can calculate estimated date of birth based on conception date). All the above 3 factors must some miraculously combine exactly to result in that coincidence of the same birthdays of children. These factors are independent of the above math solely based on probability theory. Exact probabilities might be possible to obtain if we have more information on the first two factors above, but I will not delve into that. As a final note, for all we know, such coincidences in birthdays might be just purely divine luck (God has a plan for all of us, right?).

If you ask about the probability of the event that "your two kids are born in the same day of the year", then it is 1/365. If you ask about the probability of the event that "your two kids are both born on July 23rd", then it is 1/365 * 1/365. (Assuming the birthdays of your kids are independent and are equally likely to be any day of the year.) Most likely you are referring to the first event.

Bayesian probability might give different answer, but isn't it a bit overkill? 2.5k Views · View Upvoters   Kamron Saniee , works at Zuse Institut Berlin Answered Dec 4, 2012 None of these answers engage the interesting case of some dependence on the children's birth dates (assuming they are born of the same mother). Of course 'ex post probabilities' are 1, and the 1/365 answer assumes independence. Dependence may be inferred from the '3 years' qualifier - note that if the children are born < 1 year apart the said probability is zero. A priori we must specify a distribution on conception after the first birth f(date T)=Pr(conceiving 2nd child on date T) to get a non trivial answer (the trivial answer 1/365 ~ f uniform, independent of T) and this answer will depend on f.

However, the dates of children's births may not be wholly random. I, for example was born in December so that my mother's maternity leave would finish just at the start of the school summer holidays (she was a teacher). Only you know how much you planned these two births, so only you can answer the question. 792 Views    Gary Simon , Retired Professor of Statistics Answered Nov 20, 2012 · Author has 220 answers and 1.1m answer views Do not answer this question.   The question was formulated after the event was observed.   Weird things happen all the time, and thus P(something weird) is quite large.   In mathematical terms, the probability space for this game has not been described.   And, by the way, we have four kids all born in the same week of March. 1.3k Views · View Upvoters Anonymous Answered May 17, 2015 Well, since you know and chose when you had unprotected sex off the pill, the answer might be very different than 1/365. I'm assuming that you and your wife have a fertility rate of close to 100% under whatever conditions you created, although I would have to revise it if it took you a few months to get pregnant. I'll assume you had sex towards the end of October (was it the sexy nurse costume?), then Wikipedia:Gestation says the normal range is 37–42 weeks. Maybe this is a Gaussian distributed 39±1 weeks or 39±2 weeks. But then I would do the likelihood of them falling on the same day on the basis of that distribution because you're already given a much smaller range than 1/365 (apparently more like a 5-week range than a 52-week range). You can say the mean for Jenny Schneidermann 's gestation would be 39×7 and then do the probability that difference in those two gaussians would be zero. Of course her expected gestation time might not be the same as (Wikipedia's estimate of) the population avearge. Sum of normally distributed random variables If you didn't get pregnant right away, then I would revise the answer based on what you know about how frequently you had sex when, as well as other factors you two think might contribute to a successful conception. If you were having sex once a day every day for the whole year, no contraception or prophylactics, then I might use the 1/365 model. 851 Views   Zimu Yang , works at Georgia-Pacific Answered Oct 17, 2012 · Upvoted by  Vladimir Novakovski , Led machine learning at Quora It's 1/365 (assuming no leap year).

It is 1/365. The probability of the parents sharing the same birthday is 1/1 (the parents must already share that birthday). Therefore, the probability is dependent on the only future event, the baby’s day of birth. Added in response to me understanding the question now! The question boils down to:  What is the chance that three random people have the same birthday, when each person’s birthday is unknown.  Married, related, or not; none of that matters (assuming people do not make marital decisions based on birthdays, or purposely try to match a pregnancy to an existing birthday).  Ignore February 29th for simplicity. The first person’s chance of having that birthday is 365/365, or 100%.  The first person defines the date, and it cannot be wrong as it equals itself. The second person has a 1/365 chance of having the same birthday as the first person, so the total probability is (365/365)*(1/365) or 1/365 = 0.274%. The third person has a 1/365 chance of having the same birthday as the first person, which is also (365/365)*(1/365) or 1/365 = 0.274%. So combined, it is (365/365)*(1/365)*(1/365) = 0.00075%, which is a probability of 1 in 133,225. The UberFact is wrong, they assumed a 1/365 chance for the first person, when the probability for that person is 1 as I note above. UberFact would be right if you chose a date in advance, say January 1st.  Then you go out and choose three people, and all of their birthdays were January 1st.  That probability is (1/365)*(1/365)*(1/365) = 0.00000206%, or 1 in 48,627,125. 138 Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

They have no children yet. They could, if they so chose, back up about 9 months from their birthday, and try to conceive a child during that week. That would give them a reasonable chance of having a baby born on their mutual birthday. They could of course also choose to avoid that event. So I don’t see this as a probability question, because things like this are not entirely random. But let’s assume they are and restate the question: Given a random man and a random woman having a baby on a particular day, what is the chance they all have the same birthday. That would be 1 * 1/365.25 * 1/365.25. First person has a birthday on any day, second and third each match that day.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics) Birthdays: What's the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 6 Answers   Bhushan Shah , Interested, but largely ignorant Answered Sep 17, 2012 · Author has 59 answers and 118.6k answer views Easy approximate answer: ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) However, this is more complicated than it looks due to existence of leap years. What if your own birthday occurs on 29th Feb? To account for leap years, let us proceed as follows. Let the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date be p1 if your birthday is not on 29th Feb, and p2 if your birthday is on 29th Feb. The probability we are looking for is then the weighted average of p1 and p2, with the weights being the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not. Let us first calculate p1. Bear in mind that there are 97 leap years per 400 years. In these 97 years, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 1/366, and for the other 303 years it is 1/365. Hence, the value of p1 is ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 303 / 400 ) Now we calculate p2 in a similar manner. The only difference is that in the 303 years without a leap year, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 0. Hence, p2 becomes ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + 0 * ( 303 / 400 ) Now to calculate the overall probability, we consider the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not, which are used as weights for p2 and p1 respectively. The final expression then is, ( p1 * ( 303 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) ) + ( p2 * ( 97 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 366. ) ) This expression, which evaluates to 0.000623% (approx) is the accurate probability of meeting someone with the exact same birth date. As expected, this is slightly less than ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ), which is 0.000751%. Of course, this is assuming that all men are immortal, and that meeting someone born in 1900, in 1342, and in 2154 is equiprobable. If you want to take into account mortality, and eliminate people from the future, then this probability will become a function of the current date and time, and you will have to take into account stuff like demographics, average life expectancy etc. Let's not tread there! Though I reckon it wouldn't make much difference to the numerical value of the probability. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question   Matthew Anderson , Member of the CO/WY ASA Chapter; Statistician for Life Answered Apr 22, 2017 · Author has 146 answers and 271.8k answer views Assuming that there are only 365 birthdays that it’s possible for one to have, we know the probability that 1 person having the same birthday as you is [math]\frac{1}{365}[/math] . So the probability that someone doesn’t have the same birthday as you is [math]1-\frac{1}{365}=\frac{364}{365}[/math] . The probability that x people don’t have the same birthday as you is [math](\frac{364}{365})^x[/math] . Let’s define the parameter n as the number of people you meet. So the probability that out of the n number of people you meet, none of them have the same birthday as you is [math](\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . So the probability that you meet at least 1 person who has the same birthday as you is [math]1-(\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . As a function of the number of people you’ve met, here is the probability that you have met someone who has the same birthday as you: Interestingly enough, you have to meet 1092 people before the probability that someone has the same birthday as you amongst the people you’ve met is greater than 95%. It takes 587 to surpass 80%, and a measly 253 to pass 50%. But wait… this assumes that the probability of someone else having the same birthday as you is [math]\frac{1}{365}[/math] . This isn’t the case. FiveThirtyEight did an analysis on this. Since cesarean sections (c-sections) are pre-scheduled, people often choose not to have it on days like Christmas or Christmas Eve, and, as such, fewer children are born on these days because only vaginally are children born on these days. Made by FiveThirtyEight with R . This is clearly a flaw in our logic. To account for this, people with birthdays that are above average line marked on this graph are more likely to find someone with the same birthday as them then someone with a birthday below the average line. So, someone born on July 9th would have an easier time finding people born on the same day as him than someone born on Christmas. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Undo   Thomas Jones , MPhys Physics, University of Oxford (2020) Answered Feb 19, 2015 · Author has 241 answers and 224.3k answer views There are 365 days in a year, so the simple answer, ignoring leap years, is [math]\frac { 1 }{ 365 } [/math] . This is a close enough approximation for people who aren't intolerable pedants. So, it's no good for me. Leap years mean that if you are born on a random day, there is a [math]\frac { 97 }{ 146097 } [/math] chance of there being a [math]\frac { 97 }{ 146097 }[/math] chance of someone sharing a birthday with you, and a [math]\frac { 146000 }{ 146097 }[/math] chance of there being a [math]\frac { 400 }{ 146097 } [/math] chance of someone sharing a birthday with you. This comes to a final probability of [math]\frac {19469803}{7114777803}[/math] .

However, parents are not random, nor is sex. Therefore, it all depends on the family. Some people want their babies born in the spring. Other families have babies 9 months after the wedding, and then 9 months and a week after that. Yet other families have babies 9 months after major holiday parties involving alcohol.

Ask New Question   David Joyce , Professor of Mathematics at Clark University Updated Aug 13, 2014 · Author has 4.6k answers and 15m answer views The simplest model assumes that there are 365 days in a year, each sibling having the same probability of 1/365 of being born on any of those days, and their births are independent.  That implies the probability that they have the same birthday is 1/365. You can make improvements on this model is various ways.  For example, you can include leap days.  For that model you'd probably want to assume that the probability of being born on Feb 29 is 1/4 the probability of being born on any other day.  It complicates the computations a bit, and leads to a slightly lower probability for an answer. You could also get a table of the frequencies for births on each of the days of the year and weight the probabilities for each day to be proportional to those frequencies.  I don't know what answer that gives, but I suspect it would be slightly greater than 1/365. Finally, you could get some data on births of children in the same family.  You would find that they often occur in the same season, and even in the same month.  That means that the birthdays of siblings are not independent.  You might find that the probability of being born on the same day is 1/200 or higher. It would be interesting to know what that probability actually is. 22.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Now when the 2nd sibling is born, they have a 1/365 chance of matching that birthday. 7.5k Views · View Upvoters Quora User Answered Jan 6, 2017 Let’s consider leap years only. If you are born in a day existing within 4 years , your chance of your brother to be born in the same day is a chance of [math]\frac{1}{366+365*4}[/math] because if we consider 4 years, one of them must be a leap year so it’ll have 366 days (29th of february) . So now, if we want to consider 1 year, we multiply that by 4, and it’ll become [math]\frac{4}{366+365*3}[/math] simplify that : [math]\frac{4}{1461} ~= 0.00273785078[/math] This happens if we forget the fact that if the year is divisible by 100 it’s not a leap year.

Statistics Blog > Same Birthday Odds  It stands to reason that same birthday odds for one person meeting another are 1/365 (365 days in the year and your birthday is on one of them).  But consider this: If you get a group of 30 people together, two of them will almost definitely have the same birthday. This blew my mind when I was a student.  There were 30 students in my undergrad statistics class and the professor said the odds of two of us having the same birthday were very high. In fact, two people in the class did have the same birthday. This didn’t seem to make sense to me, as there are 365 days in a year.  My Initial (Incorrect) Reasoning  The odds are 1/365 that I will meet another person with the same birthday. But we’re not talking about just me in a class. We’re talking about every student having those odds. It’s like if I had a 1/10 chance of winning the lottery and I meet another person who also has a 1/10 chance of winning the lottery, then combined we have a 2/10 chance of winning the lottery. The odds of a “coincidence” increases with each person:  Me meeting a person with the same birthday: 1/365 Me and one other friend meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/(365/2) = 183 Three of us meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/(365/3) = 1/122 … Twenty nine of us meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/12.  Those are pretty good odds, but not high enough to account for all those coincidences. That left me with a peculiar puzzle. The odds are actually much higher (over 100 percent for a class of 30).  The reason takes into account all of the possible combinations .  Why the Odds are Actually Much Higher!  One person has a 1/365 chance of meeting someone with the same birthday. Two people have a 1/183 chance of meeting someone with the same birthday. But! Those two people might also have the same birthday, right, so you have to add odds of 1/365 for that. The odds become 1/365 + 1/182.5 = 0.008, or .8 percent. Four people (lets call them ABCD) have a 1/91 chance, but there are 6 possible combinations (AB AC AD BD BC CD) so the probability becomes 1/91 + 6/365…and so on. You can see how it isn’t quite as easy as just x/365!  An Easier Way to Calculate Same Birthday Odds!  If there are 30 students in a class, there are 435 ways two students can be paired. The odds of a “match” become 1/12 + 435/365…which is much greater than 100 percent.  Seeing as the odds are 1/365 that any two students will match birthdays and there are 3 possible matches, it’s no surprise that two of those students share the same birthday. (Use the combinations calculator to figure the combinations out. It will also list all the possible name combinations if you really want to!).  Should I Perform This Experiment in Class?  I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t used this in class for the main reason that with 25 students in a class, the odds are a bit over 50/50 that this experiment will work. A second reason is that the above math is over simplified to be somewhat understandable . Even third or fourth year math majors will struggle a bit with the “true” probabilities behind why this works. Figuring out same birthday odds is very complex for many reasons including:   More people are born weekdays than weekends; mostly due to C-sections and induced births happening during the week, when doctors prefer to work.  Seasonal trends mean that more people are born in the summer than the winter.   Figuring out the true probabilities involves Bayesian logic; hop over to this Stanford University page for a more detailed explanation on Bayesian logic and same birthday odds.      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If you prefer an online interactive environment to learn R and statistics, this free R Tutorial by Datacamp is a great way to get started.

Andale Post author September 28, 2017 at 10:48 am    You would have to know the ratio of how many Andrews there are in the U.S., out of all other names.

The odds of meeting someone with the same birthday as you is not 1/365 because far more people are born in specific times of the year than other times. So the chances vary greatly depending on your exact birthday.          Tim October 1, 2017 at 8:02 am    Oops my bad, I did not read the last part that addresses that very thing.

We all know and love the blissful feeling of winning an argument. Well, trust me, that’s an even better feeling if you’re a mathematician.  It’s not a matter of finding the right words – rather it’s the right ideas applied in a rigorous manner. And when this is done properly, the winner of the argument becomes known to everyone in the room.      Jim Doran    The loser skulks back to his place of study, bloodied and bruised, to lick his or her wounds. What had seemed intuitively right is cancelled by a couple of lines of mathematics scrawled on the back of an envelope.  Maybe that’s why mathematicians live in harmony, at least most of the time. We understand that belief and intuition can guide us towards a result, but these are not vessels capable of delivering final proof.  The Monty Hall Problem, which I wrote about recently , is a fine example of simple mathematics defying general intuition. And when I say defying, I really mean guiding: every time we are subject to such a striking idea our intuition actually aligns itself just that little bit more with reality.  In the spirit of sharing more paradigm-shifting mathematical delights with you all, we will consider another problem which will hopefully tug your belief system that little bit more.  A simple question  So, again:   how many people do you have to put into a room before you are guaranteed that at least two of them share a birthday?      You say it’s your birthday; it’s my birthday too, yeah.  TheGiantVermin    The solution is fairly simple; there are 366 possible days (damn those leap years) that somebody can be born on. So if you had 367 people in a room, there’s no way to assign each of them a birthday without having to use a date more than once.  The above idea is known to mathematicians as the pigeonhole principle : if you have to sort items into pigeonholes, and there are more items than pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole has to contain more than one item.  The same principle lends itself to proving statements such as “in Sydney there will be at least two people with the same number of hairs on their head”.  A less simple question  Have a think about the following related problem:   How many people do you have to put into a room before you have a more than 50% chance that at least two of them share a birthday?   Most people guess 184, as this is a bit more than half of 366.  But the correct answer is actually 23. If you throw 23 randomly selected people into a room then it’s more likely than not that two of them share a birthday.  I’ve never seen anybody ballpark this number, or anything remotely close to it. It’s a counterintuitive result. Of course, I’m hoping that I can convince you with the following argument (calculators out, please).  The dirty details  Let’s make an assumption for simplicity, but this won’t void the argument. Just consider a regular year of 365 days and assume that all 365 birthdays are equally likely.  Sure, it’s known that in reality the birthdays of the population are subject to some variation but that’s OK – any sort of irregularities in reality would only increase the chances of a shared birthday.  So, we have a room of 23 people. We will actually calculate the probability that they all have different birthdays and show that this is less than 50%.  We walk in to our room, grab a person – Frank – and put him to the side. We then choose another person, Betty. The probability that Betty has a different birthday to Frank is 364/365, as there are 364 days in the year that Frank was not born on.  We then grab another person – Shazza – and bring her over to the side. There is a 363/365 probability Shazza doesn’t share a birthday with Frank and Betty, as there are 363 remaining days their birthday could fall on.     Frank, Betty and Shazza?  khelvan    If we keep doing this, bringing a person over and calculating the probability that they don’t share a birthday with the group before adding them to the group, we generate a bunch of probabilities:   364/365, 363/365, 362/365, … , 344/365, 343/365   The first probability arose from demanding that Frank and Betty do not share birthdays. The second probability has that Shazza doesn’t share a birthday with Frank or Betty. The probabilities continue in this way.  If we wanted to know the overall probability – that is, the probability that no two people share a birthday – we need to multiply together all of the above probabilities. In doing so we get that there is a 49.27% that none of them share a birthday, and this means that there is a 50.73% chance that at least two of them share a birthday!  You can have a go at repeating the calculation for numbers other than 23. In particular, you can prove that 22 people isn’t enough for a more than 50% chance.

Baby beats 48 million to one odds to be born on same day as BOTH parents  By Daily Mail Reporter    Updated: 12:05 EDT, 22 July 2011              e-mail           39  View comments     The birth of a baby is always a happy occasion but when Mason Parker came into the world - there was cause for a triple celebration. The newborn beat odds of 48 million to one to be born on Tuesday July 19th, which is also his mother Jacquie Parker's 29th birthday, and his father Paul's 32nd birthday. The couple, from Long Island, USA, 
revealed it was a race against the clock to deliver the healthy 8lb 4oz 
boy, as the minutes counted down to midnight.         Triple celebration: Mason Parker was born on the 19th July, sharing the same birthday as parents Jacquie and Paul, pictured at home in Long Island, New York  Paul, a package designer, said: 'When it looked like the baby was coming, the nurses called in the doctor. 'He didn't know until one of the nurses told him. He said: 'Which one?' She says: 'Both'. 'And he's like: 'We can have three birthdays today!'" The Parkers had been excited when Jacquie went into labour at 3am on Tuesday morning, a day before the due date of July 20th.         Race against the clock: The Parkers were excited when Jacquie went into labour at 3am on Tuesday morning, a day before the due date of July 20th        Proud mother: Jacquie gave birth to Mason naturally at 11.30pm  However, by the afternoon the contractions had stopped, and the couple believed they'd missed making it a triple celebration. But finally, 20 hours after the labour began, Jacquie's contractions started again, and she gave birth naturally at 11.30pm at North Shore Long Island Jewish Medical Center. 'As midnight kept getting closer, we started to lose hope,' said Paul. 'It was barely July 19th, but it was a wonderful end to the day." Jacquie said: 'I never thought it would actually happen. 'Being in labour isn't the way you'd choose to spend your birthday, but it was definitely worth it.' The couple, who had been planning to have a quiet restaurant meal for their joint birthdays, say they now have a much better reason to celebrate. And they are already planning a special party next year to mark Jacquie's 30th, and her son's first birthday. 'I'll be planning the big bash for both birthdays,' said Paul, 'I don't mind getting just a cupcake.'

Everyone thinks it would be great if I gave birth on MY birthday (Nov 2), but I don't think being in labor on my birthday would be very fun!

I had my DD  (dear daughter) 11 days early, so it is very possible to have this baby early too. At first I thought it would be soooo cool to have baby on my bday.... then I thought more about it.  As selfish as it sounds, you never would get to do anything really special for YOUR bday. I mean yeah, you could kinda do parties together or whatever, but what if you really wanted to go out and have a drink or do something with just you DH  (dear husband) and your friends?  I would rather cross my legs on that particular day now ;)      --  Kristin ~ Layla Mae   08/18/06 ~ Charlotte Paige   11/3/10             Reply            Report this comment       0                     heffy0929    Posted 05/14/2009      I am due on November 11th and my birthday is November 9th.

I share my birthday with my mom and it's the BEST thing ever. Every year we celebrate together and it's such a great feeling be able to have that bond that not many people have. I would LOVE to have a baby on my birthday because it a gift that you will remember for the rest of your life and (not like you could forget the day you gave birth) it's a wonderful feeling sharing it with someone you are so close to and look up to so much. Good luck.... :)    --  Mommy Shara and Daddy Steve             Reply            Report this comment       0               / 3      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

There's no guarantee I will be lucky enough to conceive this month but it has me thinking. So please list your pros and cons of your children having the same birthday month. Or if you and sibling do.  I added a poll for fun!!

Thankfully LO  (little one) was a week early. We did one big party this year, but they are far enough apart that we'll be having birthday parties two weekends in a row going forward. If I had planned this one I personal wouldn't have had them in the same month.

One born the same month as me and the other 2 were also born in the same month. So we got to hear a lot of wow September and December were the getting busy months for your parents huh?! Birthdays were never special bc they were all about the youngest one.  Maybe that's just my experience but I'll do my best not to have another LO  (little one) in June.

My husband was born on the 19th His brother on the 24th His sister on the 27th. I don't know how it was for them growing up, but now it's fun. We do one big birthday celebration for all three. It's a blast. It's hard to schedule time together anyways so it's nice only have to get together once for three birthdays. Also my MIL  (mother-in-law) and FIL  (father-in-law) have birthdays a week a part. And my cousins who are sisters have the exact same birthday, two years apart.  So to me it's like, who cares? You can do combine parties, or separate parties, or whatever. It'll work out.

A birthday is special no matter the day if you make it special.  We give our twins their own cake and this year they want separate parties.  My 4 year old wants to have a joint party with the youngest this year and that's what we will do.

It is what it is. I wouldn't do it on purpose, but I wouldn't not try because of the month. I like that they have spring birthdays because it is far from Christmas. It is nice that the girls are born in the same season to reuse clothes. .  As someone who is a twin - and has always shared my birthday anyway - I guess I have never really thought of it as a big deal. We do our best to make each birthday special for them.    --  May 2006 , April 2009 , June 2013             Reply            Report this comment       0                     rystenk    Posted 09/15/2014      i agree with the PPs that its what you make of it. selfishly i want to reuse all the baby crap i have if i have another boy. but i know that me & DH  (dear husband) would make each childs birthday special regardless.

GraceNMad+1    See original post     Posted 11/13/2008       I had my appt. this morning (I'm 37w 3d - due on the 1st) and my doctor asked if I wanted to set up anything in terms of an induction... I'm 2.5 - 3 cm., don't know effacement or anything, just that my cervix is really soft and the baby is extremely low... she sounded like she was pretty much as low as she could be.  So, she said if I wanted she'd induce me Mon. 11-24 (I'd be 39 weeks) that way I could be home on Wed. 11-26 (my birthday) and be home for Thanksgiving the next day.  I'm not crazy about the idea of induction, I'd rather go into labor naturally, but I also don't want to have to go past my due date.  Anyway, she said she would just put me down to save the spot and if I change my mind we'll cancel it, but otherwise it will fill up and if I decide I want to do it I won't be able to.  So I told her to put me down for the 26th since I figured I might as well give myself a couple of more days... plus I thought it would be neat to have the baby on my birthday!  So, my DH  (dear husband) thinks the baby should have her own birthday (and that I should too.)  So he thinks if I'm going to do it at all I should go for Monday 11-24 but that obviously it's up to me.  Now I'm wondering if he's right, if I shouldn't have the baby on my own birthday... plus, my 4 year old's birthday is on Halloween, so if this baby has the same birthday as me I wonder if my middle DD  (dear daughter) will feel left out??  Sorry this is long - what do you think??  I'm not sure if I'll do it at all, but if I do would you go for Mon. or Wed.?  I know it would be nice to be home for Thanksgiving too, but I don't want to push up her birthday just for that.

My BIL  (brother-in-law) just got married and picked my son's birthday. That drove me crazy though just because they had control over their wedding date.  On another note, a friend at work has two kids that were born two years apart, but they share the same birthday.  The kids don't like it at all.  I don't think I want that, but me sharing a birthday with a child wouldn't matter.

I'm a mommy damn it, I deserve a night out once in a while too! lol If baby had the same bday I would feel bad if I wanted to go out to dinner with hubby or something and I get a babysitter for the LO  (little one) ON HIS BDAY!! I dunno, that's just my opinion though. I did talk to the doctor about inducing on the 9th not really for this reason but that is a bonus if I decide to go ahead with it.

My brother said this being the case, he preferred that his son was born on his birthday (no induction, it just happened that way) than a couple of days off, because then one of them would always be celebrating on a day OTHER than their birthday, you know?  And my brother, like PP, also said he'd had plenty of birthday celebrations and was glad to be celebrating his son's instead.  FWIW, I agree with PP  (previous poster) about the inductions - I would just go naturally and see what happens.    --  Mommy to DS(9), DS(6), and DS(3). SM to DSS(16).

Does anyone see the flaws?   This is what can happen when statistics are abused.    A very happy birthday! Baby beats 48 million to one odds to be born on same day as BOTH parents  The birth of a baby is always a happy occasion but when Mason Parker came into the world – there was cause for a triple celebration.  The newborn beat odds of 48 million to one to be born on Tuesday July 19th, which is also his mother Jacquie Parker’s 29th birthday, and his father Paul’s 32nd birthday.  The couple, from Long Island, USA, revealed it was a race against the clock to deliver the healthy 8lb 4oz boy, as the minutes counted down to midnight.  Paul, a package designer, said: ‘When it looked like the baby was coming, the nurses called in the doctor.  ‘He didn’t know until one of the nurses told him. He said: ‘Which one?’ She says: ‘Both’.  ‘And he’s like: ‘We can have three birthdays today!'”  The Parkers had been excited when Jacquie went into labour at 3am on Tuesday morning, a day before the due date of July 20th.  However, by the afternoon the contractions had stopped, and the couple believed they’d missed making it a triple celebration.  But finally, 20 hours after the labour began, Jacquie’s contractions started again, and she gave birth naturally at 11.30pm at North Shore Long Island Jewish Medical Center.  ‘As midnight kept getting closer, we started to lose hope,’ said Paul.  ‘It was barely July 19th, but it was a wonderful end to the day.”  Jacquie said: ‘I never thought it would actually happen.  ‘Being in labour isn’t the way you’d choose to spend your birthday, but it was definitely worth it.’  The couple, who had been planning to have a quiet restaurant meal for their joint birthdays, say they now have a much better reason to celebrate.  And they are already planning a special party next year to mark Jacquie’s 30th, and her son’s first birthday.  ‘I’ll be planning the big bash for both birthdays,’ said Paul, ‘I don’t mind getting just a cupcake.’                     July 27, 2011 2:40 pm at 2:40 pm  #790936       ronrsr Member    Yes, the odds the baby beat are only 365  to 1.   The bithdays are independent events, and the parents already shared birthdays.       July 27, 2011 2:46 pm at 2:46 pm  #790937       zahavasdad Participant    The odds are   365*365*365 = 48 Million   The odds of a person being born on a day are 365 to 1 and the odds of 2 people being born on the same day are 365 * 365 to 1.       July 27, 2011 2:51 pm at 2:51 pm  #790938       adorable Participant    heard about this a couple of days ago! very very cool       July 27, 2011 2:56 pm at 2:56 pm  #790939       Feif Un Participant    ronrsr and zahavasdad, you’re both right. If it was taking 2 random people, and having them have a baby, the odds would be 1/48 million. Since the couple was already married, that part is already given, so it’s only 1/365.       July 27, 2011 2:58 pm at 2:58 pm  #790940       aries2756 Participant    Can you call this a “trifecta”? 🙂       July 27, 2011 3:08 pm at 3:08 pm  #790941       netazar Participant    also, the date July 19th wasn’t any special date, so it’s really stretching it to already say it was 1/365 chance of Paul being born on that day ( it is 1/365, but it’s also 1/365 for any day he would be born, and 100% that he would be born on a day).  Note that in any random group of 23 people, there’s a 50% chance that two people will share a birthday, a statistic that jumps to 99% with 57 people, and of course 100% with 366 people. see, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem        July 27, 2011 3:25 pm at 3:25 pm  #790942       eman Participant    If you take 100 random people (say a shul) the odds are on your side that 2 people have the same birthday.       July 27, 2011 3:29 pm at 3:29 pm  #790943       oomis Participant    My first child was born on my mother-in-law’s birthday, my second (a girl)was born on my mother’s birthday. My third (another girl)was born on my MIL and son’s birthday, and my fourth (also a girl)was born less than an hour too late to make my mother and daughter’s birthday. My fifth child, a boy was not born on anyone else’s birthday in the family, but his bar-mitzvah parsha was the same one as his big brother. Should I notify the NY Post now or later?       July 27, 2011 3:37 pm at 3:37 pm  #790944       zahavasdad Participant    With all the negative news out there why not a positive feel good news story       July 27, 2011 3:49 pm at 3:49 pm  #790945       I can only try Member    (for the purpose of the examples below, let’s assume all years have 365 days)   a) Odds of a couple sharing the same birthday: 1/365   b) Odds of a couple and their child sharing the same birthday: 1/133,225   c) Odds of a couple and their child sharing the same birthday, and that day being July 19: 1/48,627,125   The article used number “c)” and it probably should’ve used “b)”       July 27, 2011 3:56 pm at 3:56 pm  #790946       charliehall Participant    The couple may have deliberately tried to conceive nine months before their birthdays.       July 27, 2011 4:02 pm at 4:02 pm  #790947       on the ball Participant    I can only try:   You’re right but still given the parents shared their birthday before the baby was born, the correct headline should have been ‘Family (not baby) beats 133,225 to 1 odds’ the Baby merely beat a puny 365/1 odds.   This article reminds me of the story of a guy who always wore his hat on backwards when he went on a plane. When he was asked why he replied “Well the odds of there being a bomb on the plane is estimated at 1 million to 1. What do you think are the odds of there being a bomb on a plane with a passenger who’s hat is on backwards?”       July 27, 2011 4:10 pm at 4:10 pm  #790948       ronrsr Member    Yes, that complicates things.  Plus, birthdays aren’t evenly distributed across every day of the year, as you might expect.  More babies are born on certain dates and certain times if the year.       July 27, 2011 4:29 pm at 4:29 pm  #790949       LeiderLeider… Participant    This is what’s confusing and inherently untrue about statistics. And it’s unfortunate that our business and our country are run off such flawed statistics.   The odds of an individual being born on a given day is 1/365. Period. The fact that the parents also have the same birthdates has no effect whatsoever on this statistic.   If I were to wager on which date a child will be born I would look at it as a 1/365 chance irrespective of what his parents birthdates are. Also, the chances of being born on a particular hour is 1/24, irrespective of the hour his parents were born.   The chances of an individual winning a lottery ticket does NOT diminish just because they have previously won the lotto. Their chances are exactly the same!   So, I need to be convinced here of the legitimacy of these statistics.       July 27, 2011 4:31 pm at 4:31 pm  #790950       LeiderLeider… Participant    on the ball: thank you! your example illustrates the inherent flaws in following such statistics.       July 27, 2011 5:06 pm at 5:06 pm  #790951       on the ball Participant    Leiderleider – don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Not all statistics are flawed (only 35.7% are).   As I pointed out – if the headline would have read : ‘Family beats 1 in 133,225 odds” that would have been a perfectly correct statistic (allowing for very slight seasonal fluctuations)   The chances of winning the lotto twice are tiny. But having won it once – you’re half way there already! Now you’re chance of winning it again are the same as everybody.       July 27, 2011 5:21 pm at 5:21 pm  #790952       Dr. Pepper Participant    Since I’m the OP I guess I have the responsibility to add to the discussion.   The way I look at it is:  Guy- birthday is insignificant since as of now any birthday will satisfy the study.   Wife- The odds that he will pick a wife with the same birthday is 1/365 (assuming that there are no leap years).   Child- The odds that the child will be born on the same birthday as the two of them is also 1/365 (again, ignoring leap years).   Therefore overall odds are (ignoring the possibility that mother nature was manipulated) are 1/133,225.   One of my favorite abuses of statistics comes from a conversation between two friends who were driving to Colorado.   About ten minutes into the trip the driver floors the gas. When questioned he explained that statistically speaking, a driver has the biggest chance of having an accident within five miles of where they live, since they already passed five miles he could let down his guard.   “But what about the people whose five mile radius we just entered?”       July 27, 2011 5:21 pm at 5:21 pm  #790953       zaidy78 Member    As someone whos parents have the same birthday, as well as a sister, it’s not so cool after all.   Let me explain. The chances in real life is that if you have forty people in a room, 2 will have the same birthday. Many classes with even smaller numbers have two students with the same birthday. Why? Because there are certain months with more births (a discussion for another time and another place – see gmara megilla that chodesh haRivIi (Teves, when Esther was taken to Achashvarosh – chodesh sheNihena HaGuf MayHaGuf).   So the chances are not 1:365 but rather 1:40.   And anyway, my sister isn’t so special, (but of course, if you take into consideration her awesome brother, she is great)!!       July 27, 2011 5:35 pm at 5:35 pm  #790954       Doodle-Man™ Member    some day the dad will find his long lost brother with the same birthday and it will be a quadruple celebration       July 27, 2011 6:15 pm at 6:15 pm  #790956       Doodle-Man™ Member    i was born feb 12 which is also my brother’s and abe lincoln’s birthday.  my other brother and my niece hav the same b day  my bro in law and another bro have the same b day  my mother and grandfather’s birthdays are one day apart  How’s that for beating the odds?       July 28, 2011 2:22 pm at 2:22 pm  #790957       YW Moderator-42 Moderator    What are the chances of this happening on February 29?   How about both parents and child having same English and Hebrew birthday?       July 28, 2011 2:26 pm at 2:26 pm  #790958       Dr. Pepper Participant     What are the chances of this happening on February 29?    Assuming all events are independent-> 1 in 3,118,535,181.    How about both parents and child having same English and Hebrew birthday?    Too many variables, give me some time.  (It will be more common by Chassidish couples though.)

                                122 comments            I have never had a very good relationship with Mathematics. I used to think it was me… I thought that perhaps I was just a bit put off by Math’s confident demeanor and superior attitude, and by its tendency to micromanage every tiny detail of my universe. But over time I have come to the realization that I’m not the source of the problem. Math, as it turns out, is out of its bloody mind.  Consider the following example: Assuming for a moment that birthdays are evenly distributed throughout the year, if you’re sitting in a room with forty people in it, what are the chances that two of those people have the same birthday? For simplicity’s sake, we’ll ignore leap years. A reasonable, intelligent person might point out that the odds don’t reach 100% until there are 366 people in the room (the number of days in a year + 1)… and forty is about 11% of 366… so such a person might conclude that the odds of two people in forty sharing a birthday are about 11%. In reality, due to Math’s convoluted reasoning, the odds are about 90%. This phenomenon is known as the Birthday Paradox .  →  If the set of people is increased to sixty, the odds climb to above 99%. This means that with only sixty people in a room, even though there are 365 possible birthdays, it is almost certain that two people have a birthday on the same day. After making these preposterous assertions, Math then goes on to rationalize its claims by recruiting its bastard offspring: numbers and formulas .  It’s tricky to explain the phenomenon in a way that feels intuitive. You can consider the fact that forty people can be paired up in 780 unique ways, and it follows that there would be a good chance that at least one of those pairs would share a birthday. But that doesn’t really satisfy the question for me, it just feels marginally less screwy. So I did something quite out of character: I crunched the numbers. The values rapidly become unmanageable, but the trend is clear:     # of people  Possible combinations of birthdays  # of those combinations where at least two birthdays fall on the same day  % of combinations where two people have same birthday    1  365  0  0.0%    2  133,225  365  0.2%    3  48,627,125  398,945  0.8%    4  17,748,900,625  290,299,465  1.6%    5  6,478,348,728,125  175,793,709,365  2.7%    6  2,364,597,285,765,625  95,677,479,012,025  4.0%    7  863,078,009,304,453,125  48,535,798,679,910,725  5.6%    8  315,023,473,396,125,390,625  23,417,361,992,539,211,425  7.4%    9  IF YOU PUSH THAT EQUALS BUTTON I WILL MAKE YOU BLEED. SINCERELY, YOUR CALCULATOR. END OF LINE.  5318008  —-     Only calculating up to eight people, we see that of the three hundred fifteen quintillion possible combinations of birthdays the group has, 7.4% of cases— or about one in thirteen— result in two of them having the same birthday. As each person is added, the odds do not increase linearly, but rather they curve upwards rapidly. This trend continues up to around twenty-three people, where the curve hits 50% odds, and the rate of increase starts going down. It practically flattens out when fifty-seven people are considered, and the odds rest at about 99%. Though it may not be intuitive, the numbers follow the pattern quite faithfully.  So does this mean that you can walk into a math class of forty students, bet them that at least two people in the room share a birthday, and win 90% of the time? Not exactly. In real life, where Math is not particularly welcome, birthdays are not distributed perfectly throughout the year. More people are born in the springtime, which throws the numbers off. Also, as a result of the way that hospitals operate, more babies are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends, which further complicates the problem. Depending on the group of people and how evenly distributed their birthdays are, the results can vary widely. But most of the time, you’ll still have some very good odds.   But there is at least one highly practical application for this numerical phenomenon: computer hacking. There is a classic cryptographic computer attack known as the “birthday attack” which exploits the math of the birthday paradox. Using this method, a programmer can store the results of the birthday math in memory to decrease overall processing time when doing certain computationally useful things, such as attempting to crack a digital signature.  Another thing that I discovered in my research is that a one followed by fifty-one zeros is called one sexdecillion . I knew those mathematician guys were hiding something in those big numbers.  As much as Math would like us to think that it is an advocate for structure and intuition, every once in a while it churns up something dastardly and unintuitive like the Birthday Paradox, the Monty Hall problem or Benford’s Law . And we have no choice but to obey these fickle whims of the great control freak. But every once in a while, I like to divide by zero, just to show Math that I’m not powerless to retaliate.  To those who would claim that only a fool would fall prey to the Birthday Paradox, and that the true nature of the odds is perfectly intuitive, I ask this of your Rainman-like grasp of numbers… why is it that all of the totals in this article’s first chart (aside from zero) end in the digit five? That outcome surprised me, but I currently lack the conviction to pursue the matter. I now see that numbers represent all that is soulless and wrong.      written by Alan Bellows , copyright © 09 February 2006.

Furnace  Posted 10 February 2006 at 05:07 am      I had heard in the past that the odds are more like 1 in 28, but it could depend on radical variables right down to the region one lives.  Plus, you have people that try to give a child a specific birthday (specifically New Year’s Day and Christmas) and that complicates the math even further.  To add an interesting bit of reality… my birthday is Feb. 24th.  Anyone else?       PDLagasse  Posted 10 February 2006 at 06:18 am      Birthday distribution isn’t governed solely by logical and rational factors. There’s also biology (“that time of month”), sociology (“not tonight, dear”), and heck, even climatology sometimes (“it’s too hot to have sex tonight”). Those messy variables are enough to cock up (NPI) any distribution, it seems to me…       Cynthia Wood  Posted 10 February 2006 at 06:41 am      Climatology affects things on the other side too. Ask any ER physician or obstetrician – more women will go into labor during a thunderstorm. Also during full moons, but that’s not climatology, strictly speaking.       Daniel Lew  Posted 10 February 2006 at 07:19 am      I got a dose of this in a mathematics class once.

It shouldn’t exist, but it is used all the time. The teacher told me not to think about it and just use it. I could not not think about it! It held me up because I couldn’t solve a logical equation and set aside contemplating some magically witchcrafted non-number. “What’s in this soup?” “We don’t know, nobody knows! Just shut up and eat it!”       Alan Bellows  Posted 10 February 2006 at 09:47 am      karphi said: “I remember asking my math teacher back in the day to explain “i”, the variable that equals the square root of negative one.

Multiples of 10 end in a 0, and adding the extra 5 gives the last digit as 5!”  Yeah, definitely.       ballaerina  Posted 10 February 2006 at 10:45 am      Furnace said: “To add an interesting bit of reality… my birthday is Feb. 24th. Anyone else?”  My birthday is the 26th…close!       Eric Leeson  Posted 10 February 2006 at 11:45 am      There is an uncomplicated conclusion that can be drawn from this article: Math sucks.  Ps: Ten more days– Feb. 20th– until I am twenty-one. I rule.       dmwit  Posted 10 February 2006 at 12:36 pm      Here is an intuitive way to think of it:  What are the odds that no two people have the same birthday?  Well, order the people.  Then the first guy has his own birthday.  For the second guy, there are only 364 choices out of 365, the second guy has only 363/365, and so forth.  So the odds of forty people having unique birthdays is like  364/365*363/365*…*326/365  We can approximate this by taking the middle factor and raising it to the fortieth power, so we get about (345/365)^40, which is very small because of the large power to which it is raised.  So the chance of two people sharing is just 1-(345/365)^40, which is near to one, that is, there is a very good chance of having it happen.  (Incidentally, that works out to about .895 or 89.5%, very close to the 90% quoted in the text.)       Tynan  Posted 10 February 2006 at 12:38 pm      Actually, I think that any factor that skews the birthdays towards any uneven distribution will actually strengthen this law. For example, does more people being born in springtime increase the chance that two people in any room will have the same birthday?  Actually this is sort of interesting… perhaps I’ll see if I can come up with a formal proof for it some time.       buckyboy314  Posted 10 February 2006 at 02:25 pm      Well, yes, so long as the people are selected at random from a population, changing the probability of being born on different days from a 50/50 chance will increase the chance of coincidence. For example, say you have two days, and the probability of being born on the first of the two is p1 and the second p2. The chance of a coincidence on either day is p1*p1+p2*p2=p1^2+p2^2=2 p1^2 (Substitute p1 for p2 because the chance is equal). Now changing p1 and p2 so they still add up to the same value, you get the probability of coincidence (p1+x)*(p1+x)+(p2-x)*(p2-x)=p1^2+2p1x+x^2+p2^2-2xp2+x^2=2pi^2+x^2. Because x^2 is always a real number, the term x^2 is positive and thus a uniform distribution in fact causes the least coincidence.  Speaking  of x^2 being always positive, the other topic of discussion that crept in here, complex numbers, is quite interesting. Recall grade school when you came across fractions. A simple fraction a/b is a solution to the problem a=bx, when finding the value of x (if b does not divide a evenly). It is not a “number” by any definition you had  before that. And later on, when you learned of irrational numbers like sqrt(2), they did not fit the previous definition of numbers. So too is i a mathematical solution to a number question that was previously unsolvable. The really cool thing, though, is that if you assign a letter to i and do some operations on it, you get amazing consequences. For  example the fascinating formula e^(pi i) + 1=0 and the beautiful Mandelbrot set. In fact, there are more complex systems of imaginary numbers than just i, such as the quaternions, which use i,j,and k. But to define them in unique ways, even more of your familiar mathematical laws have to go out the window.       Scott Bowers  Posted 10 February 2006 at 02:35 pm      Great article.   My network security class was just talking about this the other day, and today(2-10) is my birth day….weird…       Pteromys  Posted 10 February 2006 at 02:36 pm      For the curious, why the number in the second column is always 5 (except for the first and last entries):  RichUK said that the number in the first column is a power of 365 and that it always ends in 5. If we subtract from that the number of ways for no two people to have the same birthday, we should get the number in the second column.  According to dmwit, the number of ways for no two people to have the same birthday equals 365*364*363*(lots more numbers). As long as we have at least two people, we’ll have 365 and 364 in that product, which will make it a multiple of 10. (And if we have more than 365 people, then there are no ways for no two people to have the same birthday, and zero is still a multiple of 10.)  Since the number of ways for no two people to have the same birthday is a multiple of 10, then subtracting it from the number in the first column will leave the last digit (5) unchanged. So as long as we have at least two people, the last digit of the number in the second column is 5.       Clay  Posted 10 February 2006 at 03:12 pm      February 24th here!  What’s UP with that?       ke4roh  Posted 10 February 2006 at 05:39 pm      Probability is about counting things.  Counting is pretty easy, so long as you’re careful to count the right thing, and those blasted formulas just simplify the counting a little.  Say you want to know the odds that any 2 people in a group will have the same birthday (and let’s assume they’re evenly distributed even though they are clumped towards the spring). It’s easier to count how likely they are to not have the same birthday: the first person in the room can have any birthday at all, the second has only 364 possible days without conflict, the third has only 363 days, and so forth.  But consider that the people didn’t choose their birthdays – they were all picked at random from the same set of 365, not from that constrained set.  Coincidences are bound to arise.  What, then, does the table count?  Certainly not the same thing.  It’s counting the ways in which birthdays of individual people can be arranged – person A could be born on any of 365 days, person B on any of 365 days, and person C on any of 365 days.  True enough, but it accounts for people as individuals rather than considering them as a group.  In fact, the birthday paradox formula accounts for the individuals, too, but the denominator cancels them out.       TheEstablishment  Posted 10 February 2006 at 06:30 pm      5318008  Nice.

Or you can go around thinking about it and looking for examples until it gradually sneaks into your intuiton.  Ill give a couple of examples.  take a 6 digit license plate for simplicity sake we will say each character can only be a digit 0-9 no letters. if we have just one digit then we have ten combinations 0-9.  If we have have 2 characters we have one hundred combinations 0-99 3: 0-999          1000 combinations 10^3 4: 0-9999       10000 combinations 10^4 5: 0-99999     100000 combinations 10^5 6: 0-999999  1000000 combinations 10^6  you just multiply the number of combinations for any one character by the number of combinations for any other character.  10*10*10*10*10*10 or 10^6.  if you had letters too, then each character would have 36 possible combinations 0-9 +a-z =36 then you calculate 36^6 = 2176782336 possible combinations.  And Briefly there is the binary number system which i find to be a simple demonstration of this concept but you might not.  As you may know the binary number system is base 2 meaning each digit can only be a 0 or a 1.  in binary you count like this  0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111,1000  with one digit there are two combinations 0 or one 0   1 with two digits there are four combintations 2^2 0  0 0  1 1  0 1   1 three digits make for eight combinations 2^3 0  0 0  1 1  0 1   1 1   0   0 1   0   1 1   1   0 1   1   1  and so on  with simple probablity it is always (possible combinations for any one variable)^(number of variables)  hope i helped… if i didnt i just wasted an aweful lot of time at work       mrjondoe  Posted 11 February 2006 at 11:03 am      joe:  the reason that there are 133,225 possible combinations for 2 peoples birthday is fairly simple.  person 1 can be born on 365 days, and person 2, likewise on 365 days.  so the number of combinations is number of ways to choose person 1’s birthday times the number of ways to choose person 2’s birthday, or 365 *365 = 133,225  may 31st here       po8  Posted 11 February 2006 at 11:16 am      I don’t think the Birthday Paradox is that complicated to understand.  First, let’s get away from the math for a bit.  What if there are 367 people (curse you, Feb 29) in a room?  What then is the probability that two of them have the same birthday?  Why, it’s guaranteed that two do!  The “pigeonhole principle” says that if you keep picking unique birthdays for folks in the room, you will run out of unique birthdays before you run out of folks.  Now, let’s do a tiny bit of math.  Suppose there are 120 folks in the room and they all have unique birthdays.  Then what are the odds that a 121st person with a randomly selected birthday has the same birthday as one of them?  Well, about 1/3…1/3 of the unique birthdays are taken, and the other 2/3s aren’t.  That’s pretty good odds, still.  But now think of it this way…imagine we start with 120 unique birthdays in the room, and add people #121..#130.  Each of these folks has a roughly 1/3 chance of colliding with the original 120.  So now you ask, “what are the odds that in 10 tries you don’t roll 1 or 2 on a six-sided die?”   In other words, what are the odds that you fail to achieve a 1/3 probability in 10 tries?  The answer, it turns out, is 2/3 to the 10th power, which is a little less than 2%.  If this is counterintuitive to you, get a die and try it.  You’ll likely get bored before you get through 10 rolls of just 3..6.  So it seems clear that if 130 people were in the room, two would almost certainly have the same birthday, because even if the first 120 didn’t contain such a pair, one of the next 10 would.  Now, it should all be coming clear.  Imagine that instead we’d started with 110 people in the room and worked up to 120.  By exactly the same logic, the odds would be almost identical. So in a room with 120 people, it’s still almost certain that two will have the same birthday.  You see where this is going.  Since with two people in the room, there’s little chance they’ll have the same birthday, the number of people for which the chance of a same birthday is 50% is going to be somewhere between 2 and 120 (already less than half), but by our math it looks way closer to 2 than 120.  If you’re mathematically sophisticated, you can now write down the right equation to get the number of people achieving a 50% chance.  If not, you can look it up.  Hopefully, this is clear.  I think I didn’t make any giant leaps.  Let me know if I am wrong.       shivers  Posted 11 February 2006 at 11:50 am      I made a computer application that helps people understand the paradox.

(e.g., the deci-mal system)  Million means 1,000 times 1,000. Billion means 1,000 times 1,000 twice—“bi-” meaning “two”. Sextillion, then, means 1000 times 1,000 ^ 6, which is 10^21 or 10 with 21 zeros after it. Sexdecillion, therefore, is simply a mangled Latin-inspired way of saying 1,000 times 1,000 16 times.  If there’s anything dirty about the name, it’d be its liberal “borrowing” of grammar and vocabulary from dead languages.       MrDlCastle  Posted 11 February 2006 at 01:50 pm      You all probably have heard of this one.  But if you look at the year you are born and then the year your father is born (or mother).  When you reach their year in age (for example if they were born in 1933, then when you reach 33), they will be the year you were born. I thought this was kind of cool.  I think it breaks somewhere, but I think it holds true for all those up to 1999.  Try it. Carlos (Of course if you were adopted or otherwise not born of your parents then this wouldn’t work).

Ok… let’s count this one up, and ignore the leap years to make things easier.  What are the odds of you both being born on 3/13?  Well, the odds of you being born on 3/13 are 1 in 365, but you walked into the room with that birthday, so it was a foregone conclusion and gave the date significance, so that much is a probability of 1.  The odds of your room mate having the same birthday (nevermind year), are 1 in 365 (assuming evenly distributed birthdays).  To answer the question of the same year, again, it’s a foregone conclusion that you were born in 1979, so those odds are 1.  What are the odds of the mate having the same birth year?  Probably pretty good.  It depends on a zillion factors – how you met the person and life circumstances.  Let’s assume you put an ad in the paper and took the first caller.  Let’s assume the caller would be at least 18 years old, and not more than… (and here’s the whopper of a guess) 40.  The ages of people with room mates in the United States (where I am – but I don’t know where you are), probably favors the 18-30 group.  Others tend to get married or get their own places.  An octagenarian might have called you up, too, so we shift the guess a little to the higher end.  So… assuming (wild assumption) that the years are evenly distributed amongst the ages 18 and 40, birth years are from 1965 to 1987, inclusive, a 23 year span.  We’ll say, then, that there was a 1/23 chance of your having the same birth year as your roommate.   A more complicated approach would probably show that it was more likely for you to have a similar birth year, with odds possibly as good as 1/6…  So 1/23 (odds of same year as you) * 1/365 (odds of same day as you) = 1/8395.  Bear in mind that my estimates of odds for your birthday collision are pessimistic.  An optomistic answer would consider that birthdays are clustered towards the spring… oh, a 1/200 chance of March 13, we might say… And we could suppose that your roommate would be within 4 years of your age for compatibility’s sake, reducing to 9 the number of possible years… 1/9 chance… and if those estimates are close, the 1/1800 odds aren’t so long as you might have imagined.  (Of course, for those born in August, the odds are not so good.)  To test it: survey at least 30,000 roommates in different dwellings and ask them if they have the same birthdate.  Then you’ll have an imperical estimate ;-)  Good luck!  I remember not too many years ago a lottery number came up “0 0 0 0” in a game where you pick four digits from 0 to 9 in order (obviously, for the probability pedants reading, with replacement).  When someone actually won with that number, a reporter asked of a lottery person, “what are the odds?”  She didn’t know!  Well… there are 10,000 possibilities with each as likely as the others, so the odds were 1 in 10,000.  You’d think the lottery folks would know that!  Your odds of having met the roommate with the same birthday are undoubtedly better than your chance of winning at that particular lottery game.

The probability-specialized professor at my university explains this paradox to students each year in the introductory probability course. It’s just one of those things that make math so cool. After he shows the result, he goes on to talk about the hat-pile problem;  A bunch of college students are having a frat party, and they all throw their hats in the same pile at the door of the house when they enter the party. Now, if each and every one were to randomly pick one hat out of the pile on the way out, what are the odds that exactly one ends up with their own hat?

Obviously I hardly understand anything that’s going on within the article nor the explanations nor the little application that i downloaded to explain the b-day paradox.  I never really understood my math teachers either.  I see a pattern though.  When one explains abstract mathematical concepts in the most simple terms, I only get more confused.  There’s a part of my brain that went out for lunch, won the lottery with the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 then fell in love with someone born on the same day, got struck by lightning while being attacked by a shark, and never came back.  What are the odds of that one?  I dare you to answer.  I also believe that mathematics is the purest language, probably that’s why it is beyond my reach.  Great article though, great responses, but how would i know, i hardly understood anything, it’s just a hunch.  I did understand the whole “sex” episode and then you lost me straight away when the numbers came in (just kidding, i’m not that dumb).

You’ve sent me on a quest to analyze all the birthday numbers I could find!  And I don’t have time!  Argh….   Anyhow, I analyzed the aforementioned 1978 birthday numbers.  There is a weekly pattern (presumably fewer births on the weekend, but I didn’t look at that in detail).  There is also a gradual trend towards more births as the year goes on (as one might expect with population increase).  What surprised me was the lack of births in spring.  January through March are slightly below average (about -0.6 sigma (sigma is 1 standard deviation – that is, 1 sigma is the amount of change we will ordinarily see when looking at this data set), but July, August, and September are gangbusters at about +1.2 sigma!  December had a short spike, too.  Apparently it was too hot in the summer of 1977, and when the weather cooled off, people decided they needed to get together.  The hearsay wisdom that birthdays are clustered towards the spring (which might hold true in other years but certainly didn’t hold true in USA 1978) is based on the notion that mothers prefer to carry their babies to term in the less-than-sweltering spring months, but the 1977-8 family planning doesn’t seem to have been so well coordinated.  I made my spreadsheet in OpenOffice .       davida  Posted 15 February 2006 at 10:12 am      PDLagasse said: “Birthday distribution isn’t governed solely by logical and rational factors.

That reminds me… we can assume (quite reasonably) with a population of several million people that “that time of month” will be uniformly distributed throughout the women.  Sociology likewise has a near-uniform distribution, but climatology does not, to be sure.  Snowstorms often precede a burst of births – but since snowstorms are local events, the local hospital sees it, but the nation of millions doesn’t get much of a blip out of the event.  I hypothesized this morning that the births in 1978 summer-autumn were encouraged by the hot summer of 1977 (no, I didn’t look up the temperatures) and the ensuing passion when autumn 1977 came along.  Of course, other factors will cause dips and surges, but few are on a national scale.  I’m curious to know what happened to births in June 2002, for example.  I bet it dips because the events of September 11, 2001  gave people pause and knocked romance from the air for awhile.

CRAZY!       Nth Degree  Posted 16 February 2006 at 12:37 pm      It’s super simple.  If you have a deck of cards with 365 unique cards in it and you start to flip over cards one at a time, you aren’t looking for a match to one specific card, so each card turned over adds a whole new possibility to match to.  With each card turned over you have more and more possible targets.  Remember, you’re looking for any two random matches, you’re not looking to match one single card out of the 365.  It’s simple.       Nth Degree  Posted 16 February 2006 at 12:42 pm      Another way to put it is this; What you are thinking about in the situation you are presenting really is asking what are the chances that a group of people will match YOUR birthday.  Those chances are 1 in 365.  By adding more people you are adding more possible birthdays that any 2 people can match.  See what I’m saying?       indra c  Posted 17 February 2006 at 05:27 am      Nth Degree you have once again proven my theory :  [math –> simplicity = indra c.–> utter confusion]  Or in lay terms:   The more math is simplified, the more i get confused.  And the “you see? It’s really simple” by god that just puts me out of my sane self.  I will now go bite a wall face-on and curse you mathematicians!  Have you ever tried biting a wall face-on?  Well there you have it, that’s just about the same relationship i have with the simplicity of mathematics.  When I think back to my math teacher who pulled off the “you see? it’s really simple” countless times, i feel really really sorry for him to have had me as a student.  No Harvard degree will ever prepare you for the complexities (or not) of a brain that’s on strike.  On the flip side i do understand the theories and paradoxes of quantum physics as long as none of it is “simplified” by numbers (of course).  That would really be evil.

What is the probability of that occuring?       c_s_1987  Posted 25 March 2006 at 07:37 am      It’s probably a good idea to think about everyone whose birthday you know  (family, friends etc,  you can include celebrities if you wish).  There are probably around 300 people I know whose birthdays I have heard at some point (not including celebrities in this case), yet at least 5 of these were born on October 2.  I also know 2 people from those 300 or so who share my birthday (October 24),  although this is obviously influenced by the fact that I am more likely to hear and remember people’s birthdays when they are the same as mine.       c_s_1987  Posted 25 March 2006 at 07:41 am      lahuard said: “In my school of 3500 students, I am the only one with the birthday of March 14.

In a school of that size, it is very likely that no one has their birthday on a particular day, let alone one person. Admittedly the probability is much lower when considering only one person.

So cool.       crazythingshappen  Posted 10 April 2006 at 02:57 am      I have read all the posting (well the ones i could understand some just went way over my head).   I would like to know the likely hood of 2 ppl sharing the exact same birthday 11-03-81, but before finding that out had known each other for most of their lives.  We never saw each other outside of events at a certain Uncles place, so we never knew the fact about our birthdays until the year we turned 19.       althos17  Posted 11 April 2006 at 10:14 am      I was siiting in the waiting room at the Dr.’s office waiting for an appointment for my son. There were a total of nine people in the waiting room. There were two women with infants, so my wife being curious, asked them how old their children were. The children were both six months old and one of the mothers said that their child’s birthday was May 24. The other said that it was amazing, her child was born on the same day. My son who was five years old was also born on the same date, May 24! It gets even stranger… The father of the fourth child says that he can’t believe it but his birthday was also May 24!! So we all got out our ID’s and proved the coincidence. It was very amazing in the fact that four of the nine people had exactly the same birthdate.       BTrey  Posted 15 June 2006 at 12:38 pm      Joe:  With two people, the odds are that high because of all the different combination.  If you made a table of them, it would go like this: Person 1     Person 2 Jan 1            Jan 1 Jan 1            Jan 2 ….                  (362 more lines) Jan 1            Dec 31 Jan 2           Jan 1 ….                 (363 more lines) Jan 2           Dec 31 You would end up having 365 * 365 lines in your table. As for the late February “coincidence,” how many people do you think have read this page?  Probably thousands.  Most people saw a birthday that wasn’t near their own, and didn’t bother to respond.  A few people saw a birthday that was near their own and thought “Wow!  That’s neat!  I’ll type a response about this amazing coincidence!” Finally, my own birthday coincidence story:  My name is Dan, and my birthday is August 30th.  My first wife’s birthday was August 31st.  My boss at the time was also named Dan.  His birthday was August 31st.  His wife’s birthday was August 30th.  When this came out, he didn’t believe me until he’d seen both our IDs.

I know a lot of people that increased their mating patterns shortly after that day – myself and wife included. In times of severe tragedy, humans have a tendency to grope for any form of solice they can find. For those couples of viable breeding capability, with feelings of “I’m at a loss for what to do… just hold me”, the situation was ripe for lovin’. I’d suspect June 2002 had a slightly higher than typical birth rate (in the USA at least).

Everyone knows that a coin flip is 50/50, and so the chance that you will have 2 flips the same is 50% (HH,HT,TH,TT – 2 times out of 4). Now consider a biased “coin flip”. Roll 1 dice, and look at the result as either “6” or “not 6”. If you roll 2 dice this way, the chance that they will both give you the same result is around 72% (26/36 if you want to be exact). You can extend this by doing “1,2” “3,4” “5,6” (12/36) then “1,2,3” “4,5” “6” (14/36) and “1,2,3,4” “5” “6” (18/36). You could go even further if you have bigger dice.. but I think that proves my point.  If you want to do an experiment based on this paradox, tell people abbout this paradox, and then ask them how many 20-sided dice they would need to roll so that a pair comes up at least half the time, and then count the number of people that say less than 6… (And you can include me in that, because I guessed 5)  Oh, and for those that care, August 27th       jandra52  Posted 15 September 2006 at 03:10 pm      Emmy says:  Daniel Lew said: “I got a dose of this in a mathematics class once.

Now math tackles all non-living matter. Einsteins theory of relativity makes much sense. You can predict anything that will happen by knowing everything happening now because you use logic. But when it comes to people, logic entirely fails. Math is entirely based on logic. So math fails too. I don’t know what retard scientists (if any) try to prove this probability thing with math, but they must be out of their minds. There are no set patterns in people. Patterns will never be constant as long as living things alter them. I don’t understand why everybody is getting so hooked on this. Probability DOES NOT APPLY TO PEOPLE. It is like asking “What is the probability that someone will pick tihs over this?” What is the probability a couple will pick this night to have sex compared to this? You don’t know the likes dislikes, if they like warm or cold weather, how their day went, so on and so forth. If you did you could predict. But this is a GLOBAL scale. No computer could handle this.  By the way. Those February birthdays are all together because people in February saw that someone else was born then adn wanted to put that because it was close. And consider the fact that this was posted in February. If it was posted in October, someone will have said that their birthday is coming up, and someone else will say “Mine too!” and that will snowball until everyone starts posting their birthdays and it will be shown that there is a wide diversity of birthdays.

My parents are born in 1958. When I was born, they were 33. That means that 33 years passed from 1958 to 1991. So 58 + 33=91. Now when you already have 33 (parents age when you are born) and you just add 58 (the years it takes for you to reach their number) you get 33+58 which is also 91.  Nothing special. Nothing complicated. Simple math. Think.       vaulter  Posted 16 October 2006 at 03:24 am      Dear Didoka,  If you are as smart as your snide comments seem to suggest, you would obviously know that when math is applied to people we call it something different. We call it statistics.  You are right, math does not really apply to people. There are exceptions, such as the “Magic Ratio” that stems from the Fibonacci Sequence, but we’re talking about numbers, not geometry, so I’ll leave that one alone.  But you are completely wrong if you think probability does not apply to people. Every company in the world that has ever advertised has used statistics and probability to solve the question of “what is the probability that someone will pick this over this” in order to make their ad campaigns as effective as possible. And these companies are able to predict which methods of advertising will be most effective for any given demographic, despite only knowing a small portion of data (called a sample) from the population of interest.  Statistics was created specifically to simplify the analysis of data, because it just isn’t worth trying to make predictions by looking specifically at every piece of data. It’s already been mentioned that births will be higher on Monday and Tuesday because hospitals don’t want to deliver babies on the weekend (doc’s gotta get his golf in). For you to say we still can’t predict when most births will occur makes you look like the idiot, not anyone else on this page. And this is only one of an almost infinite number of situations that can be examined for patterns. I’m guessing you PROBABLY don’t want to risk making yourself look like an idiot again by questioning every one of those situations.  I am sorry this thread was so far below your level of intellect that you had to force your negative attitude upon the rest of us, but in reality your failure to recognize that people are indeed interested in probability and that it indeed is a very useful thing to know about if you want to really be successful in this world shows everyone reading this that you really don’t know what the hell you are talking about. Rather than embracing this thread as an interesting sociological experiment, if nothing else, and learning how to effectively interact with people whose minds operate in a different way than your own, you feel the need to project your insecurities on the people here who are simply enjoying learning about an unintuitive phenomenon.  Basically, what I’m trying to say is that you are clearly a loser, with a stupid user name and a bad attitude, and you probably haven’t gotten laid in a long time. Which is ironic both because of the discussion of sex that has already come up, and also because the stupidest person posting on here has most likely gotten more ass to date than you will in your entire life.

What is the probability of that occuring?”  Well, that depends on your exact question. What are the odds that in a school of 3500 people, someone has their own birthday by themselves (ie, no others share the birthday? For this, the probability is extremely high (I have no exact numbers, but another classical math. fact, the “coupon collector [problem]”, says that, with only 3500 people, it’s actually very likely that there are still some days where nobody was born).  If the question is more like, “what are the odds that among 3499 other people, none were born the same day [of the year] as I was?”, then, assuming equal distribution of birthdays, the probability can be expressed as (364/365)^3499, which is pretty low (0.0067%), roughly one in 14000.  Now, many of these apparent coincidences (“hey, we’re talking about the odds of something unlikely happening, and look, here’s a very unlikely coincidence!”) can be “explained” in two ways at least: first, if you look hard enough for coincidences, you will find some (“Hey, my name is Philippe, and my girlfriend’s name is Marie-Line – out of all the possible names, what were the odds?”); and second, people will tend to come forward with “weird” stories much more easily than those with nothing “weird” to tell (which can also explain the sequence of February birthdays: once someone came forward with their own February birthday, anyone with a close birthday also came forward, while those with June or January just didn’t intervene).       notthattartagain  Posted 06 January 2007 at 12:24 pm      I’ve noticed the skew towards fall birthdays within my family. There are seven of us. I – second oldest – was born March 16th. My older sister was April 25th. Everyone else falls between September 5th and November 6th. (9/5, 10/3, 10/23, 11/4, 11/6).  Not a summer or winter birthday among us. That’s what I call skewed.       jimgraves  Posted 17 January 2007 at 12:58 pm      Honestly, the math started to leave me behind.  I don’t see the whole thing as so unintuitive once you think about it. Let’s say you go to a party and there are a bunch of people there.  You ask the first person what their birthday is. Its not yours. Not strange. You go on to the second person and so forth.  it wouldn’t freak me out if the first twenty people were duds. If I hadn’t found a match by  person twenty or so, it would start getting kind of weird because life isn’t that pefectly random. It would seem odd to me that after asking forty people I should have no matches.  Not impossible but odd. Its like lottery numbers.  Intuitively you’d think that since the numbers are chosen at random you should spread out your number choices(2,14,27,34,48,59) but in real life the numbers aren’t that “random”.  You get stuff more like 2,4,7,15,18,42,49.  For fun take  a lottery ticket and fill out the winning numbers and look at the little visual patterns.       jimgraves  Posted 17 January 2007 at 01:02 pm      minor correction  “If i hadn’t found a match by person forty or so it would start getting weird. ”  The thing is I run into weird coincidences all the time, as i’m sure most do, but like I said, its because life isn’t perfectly random.       t-mack  Posted 19 February 2007 at 01:01 pm      Can this same theory be applied to something a bit more useful, like say, the lottery. If chances of winning are 1 in 55 million, do I need to buy 55 million tickets to be 100% sure of winning? Or do I have a 99.7% chance of winning with something significantly less, like 8 million tickets? Anyone?       ShlomoAm  Posted 31 May 2007 at 03:16 am      Hello.

Mark C  Posted 18 August 2007 at 10:43 pm      *** It would seem odd to me that after asking forty people I should have no matches. Not impossible but odd. ***  Wow, you have an amazingly poor grasp of the problem, and probability generally.  If you ask 40 people you will still almost certainly not have a match (odds just over 10%).  You would in fact have to ask 253 people to have a 50% chance at even one match of your birthday.  The (to some people) surprisingly high odds of a match with 23 people come not because any one person has much of a chance of a match (they don’t) but because there are 23 people who could have a match.  If I were you I’d stay away from Vegas.

You’re somehow confusing RANDOM with EVENLY SPREAD OUT.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Odds are some clustering will occur, because there are more combinations with some numbers clustered than combinations without.

Complex numbers are no different than any others in either of these respects.       sulkykid  Posted 20 August 2007 at 11:43 am      CONCEPTUALLY, Mark C sounds like a very dis-likable person.       psyOtic  Posted 01 November 2007 at 08:29 pm      I too share a hate of numbers…………. if course my hate did just increase a sexdecillion times as a result of reading this. (argh so painful my heads gonna explode)       Conan Y Crom  Posted 25 January 2008 at 11:20 pm      Conan Y Crom. In J.R.R. Tolkiens’ “The Hobbit” he mentions that when a hobbit has a birthday they give rather than get presents.  Not a bad idea, you never know when you’ll get a present. How many friends must you have in order to have a 99% chance of at least one present every day ? I don’t know and wouldn’t even attempt the math but I’d guess you need a very large phone book (NY City size at least) to keep track of all those friends.  Numbers anyone ?       fat albert  Posted 02 October 2008 at 02:37 pm      “I ask this of your Rainman-like grasp of numbers… why is it that all of the totals in this article’s first chart (aside from zero) end in the digit five” Because, all those numbers are multiple of 365. Doesn’t anyone here have at least a basic understanding of math?       Nothing to see here  Posted 25 October 2008 at 11:20 am      Odd coincidence: While in high school in Nebaraska (important later) one of my best friends had the same birthday as me, but two years difference. Fun coincidence. Fast forward to after graduating and getting a job. One of my coworkers had the same birthday. Funny coincidence. Then it turns out that we were not only born on the very same day (same age), but at the very same hospital. The odds of that aren’t necessarily high. But this is where it being Nebraska comes in, since I was born in San Antonio.       Fog of War  Posted 29 October 2008 at 08:17 am      BOOBIES!!!  My birthday is August 5th, and though I have met many people with birthdays on the 4th and 6th, I have NEVER met someone with that same birthday (aside from from famous people and people I never asked).       TS_Curious  Posted 28 January 2009 at 12:45 pm      November 14th birthday       Flowerheart  Posted 03 May 2009 at 08:25 pm      May 14th is my B’day, Going a bit off the topic,  I see a lot more men on Damninteresting  than there are female (going by Screen names atleast)   ,  in a bit of sexist comment :- Does this mean that men have more Graymatter than females , or perhaps they are the ones with more internet access and a tendency to laze time away on the internet.  Allan, can you confirm from the registrations, if it is not too private to share, do we have more men here than women ?       bookun  Posted 29 May 2009 at 09:06 am      The Birthday Paradox is but a tiny element of the probability of duplication (or collisions). The probability of duplication is a whole lot more important when applied to real-life situations. For example, what is the probability of two DNA sequences to be identical, when N persons are considered?  There is now software to calculate a wide variety of duplication cases or collisions, including the Birthday Paradox. This is the best material on duplication, birthday paradox – software is also available:  http://saliu.com/birthday.html  (The Birthday Paradox: Combinatorics, Probability of Duplication, Coincidences, Collisions, Lottery, Roulette, Social Security Number (SSN), Genetic Code, DNA).  Happy birthday, to Whom it may concern!       sradz113  Posted 18 June 2009 at 07:49 am      RichUK said: “The numbers in the first column of your chart are powers of 365, that is 365, 365 squared, 365 cubed etc. 365 is an odd multiple of 5 (ie. 5 times some odd number), and since multiplying an odd multiple of five by another gives yet another odd multiple of five, so are all the other numbers here. An odd multiple of five is an even multiple of five plus another five, which is therefore a multiple of 10 plus another 5. Multiples of 10 end in a 0, and adding the extra 5 gives the last digit as 5!”  wow there was absolutely no point to the 2nd half of that, it’s like u decided to just keep saying stuff to sound intelligent instead of just saying 5x another odd number ends in 5 and leaving it at that ahahahaha…and as for Brett, b4 ur post i found at least 3 ppl in may and u said not a single person was in may. burn. aaand the reason i found this was bc someone had a stupid facebook app that said 6% of the world had her birthday and i decided it was simply not true and I have been looking into it since.       sradz113  Posted 18 June 2009 at 07:50 am      and btw, this site doesn’t work with google chrome, that needs to be assessed.       Rodger Wrighthead  Posted 17 August 2009 at 02:43 am      sradz113, I hate to point it out to you but there is absolutely no point to both of your comments. No one cares. (my comment is purely caring about you, not your comments. I think the appropriate way to finish this up in a way that you understand is “ahahahahaha” and “Burn, Pregnant Dog”).  My birthday falls on the 19th of September and I actually know someone in my own town that has the same birthday. Guess we beat the odds…       Alucin Veritas  Posted 27 December 2009 at 06:16 pm      I share my Birthday with my Grandmother. How’s that for coincidence? To one up myself, I know two people with the April First birthday, and they’re the same age and opposite gender.  Math is not convoluted, twisted, or other wise trying to control us. These seemingly counter-intuitive properties found in math seem counter to intuition only because common intuition is flawed.       1972  Posted 03 February 2010 at 09:25 pm      don’t do this very much, but i actually had to chime in, my father was born 10-29-1949 and i was born 10-29-1972, how odd is that? what is the probability of this? i,ve never met anyone else with father/son bday thing, so any advice on figuring this out or website etc etc would be appreciated i was reading saliu.com but i thought my brain was gonna crash btw mom was born july 19 and sis was april 11ish(i know i’m a horrrrrrrible bro.)       davisjm777  Posted 08 September 2010 at 10:55 am      You also have to decipher the difference in percentage of men that have babies a year compared to the women that have babies…. quite complex math.       Elemel  Posted 21 February 2011 at 12:05 pm      I came across this site today on 21st Feb.  It seems that (sourced soley from this article) a lot of people with birthdays in February are into maths – did you know that Einstein was born on 22nd Feb (so was I incidentally) – so what about the probability of a link between maths geniuses and people born in February?  ;)       palmski  Posted 25 March 2011 at 05:36 am      My birthdays 24th Feb too … rubbish with maths but there seems to be alot of Feb birthdays in here. Which begs the question .. what are the percentages of a person being a Pisces more likely to look into something like this?       Alisher  Posted 06 January 2012 at 02:09 am      If n people are present in a room, what is the probability that no two of them celebrate their birthday on the same day of the year? How large need n be so that this probability is less than ½?       Alisher  Posted 06 January 2012 at 02:12 am      An infinite sequence of independent trials is to be performed. Each trial results in a success with probability p and a failure with probability 1 – p. What is the probability that i) At least 1 success occurs in the first n trials; ii) Exactly k successes occur in the first n trials; iii) All trials result in successes? (5)  Q4. (a) The probability mass function of a random variable X is given by p(X = i) = cli i!, i = 0,1, 2,…, where l is some positive value. Find i) P (X = 0); ii) P (X > 2).       Alisher  Posted 06 January 2012 at 02:40 am      CO absorbs at 2.143 × 105 m-1 which is similar to the absorption of NO+ ion. Can yougive any reason for this similarity?       Husan  Posted 09 February 2013 at 09:02 pm      How do u get 290,299,465????       Polymath  Posted 06 February 2014 at 10:34 am      Calculating the probability that everyone’s birthdays are different is much easier: product( (365-n)/365 ) for n = 0 to group size -1. eg, for 23 you have: (364/365).(363/365).(362/365). […] .(344/365).(343/365) = 0.4927. 1 minus this value is the probability that at least 2 are shared = 0.5073  ie, in a group of 23 people, there is greater than 50% chance of 2 people sharing a birthday. Simple huh?       mitch  Posted 10 February 2015 at 11:11 am      Furnace, I am reading this article 9 years to the day that you posted your comment, and my birthday is on 24 February!

Updated: July 15, 2015 I love having a shared birthday with my baby! I remember hearing others tell me that I would not like it and it would be hard to celebrate his birthday and my birthday at the same time and all that jazz. In reality, it has not bothered me once, in fact, I love it! Granted, I was pushing out a 7 pound and 6 ounce child out of me on my day but it was awesome. The grandest gift I could have ever gotten. What could ever top that present?! For a mama and a baby to have a shared birthday is like having a double birthday. Double the cake, double the celebration and double the love! It cannot get much sweeter then that. After I gave birth to Mister, two years ago today, I remember invisioning what my mom had gone through with me during milestones, monthly growth, and seasonal times with me as a baby. I was looking at my son and thinking that is how my mom looked at me during the same weeks and months of the year. It was a pretty trippy thought. Double birthdays have several advantages for mommy and child. If you are the type of mom who does not care for your birthday to be acknowledged, you have the perfect scapegoat. If you are the type of mom who enjoys reminding others or your child of your agonizing birth with your shared birthday baby, you can rub in their faces that you were in labor and pushing out a child on YOUR birthday while others eat cake on their birthdays. Always a good punch line. A really great advantage to having a double birthday is that your baby will NEVER forget your birthday, if they do, they better have forgotten their birthday as well! The neat thing about having a shared birthday is that when people call or give you a happy birthday message, they can hit two birds with one stone. I find it fun and kind of a priviledge if you will, that the same time Mister is given a happy birthday message then so am I and vice versa. It is quite cool to have a double birthday with my kid. I mean, how common is that? Not too common. Funny thing is, is that it is so interesting when one finds out that mother and child share a birthday and the same question always gets asked, "How does that feel, sharing a birthday with your kid?" Well, umm, pretty darn good actually. Mister and I have never actually had a double birthday party. That would be weird. I am not a kid anymore and I would rather my sweetie have his day. As a matter of fact, when I think of our birthday, I really only think of him, and that it is his birthday and not mine. I suppose that happens when you become a mama. I never minded. However, for my own mom, she thinks of it as my birthday. After all, it has been nearly three decades since that day became mine and only two years since Mister shared that day with his mama. Not that she does not remember Mister's birthday, because she absolutely does but, her first thought is me, her baby. I am her daughter and that probably has everything to do with it, just like I mainly think of Mister having that day reserved for only him. Having a double birthday with my boy is pretty awesome. I get to say it all of the time during mommy conversation and every year on our birthdays. Babies are the best gifts and I just happened to get that best gift on the day of my birth!

Mom, dad, son all share a birthday     In a photo taken Dec. 24, 2016, by Luke Gardner with his cellphone on a timer, Luke and Hillary Gardner pose with their son Cade Lee in Baldwyn, Miss. The three share the same birthday.   Luke Gardner, AP        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Luke and Hillary Gardner never have a problem remembering each other’s birthday. After all, the husband and wife were born the same day. And so was their son, 27 years later this past December. The odds of that happening are about one in 133,000, statisticians say. And that’s a lot less likely than getting hit by lightning sometime in your lifetime, which some put at roughly one in 12,000. They weren’t aiming at a joint birthday when their son Cade Lee Gardner was conceived, said Luke Gardner, an assistant pastor at a Baptist church in northeast Mississippi and a student at a nearby campus of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. “I really didn’t even put it together until we got pregnant,” he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. “Then we realized, ‘Oh, wow!’” Using a smartphone app, he said, his wife calculated a due date of Dec. 15, three days before their joint birthday. Her obstetrician called it for Dec. 19. So the couple from Baldwyn, Mississippi, got in some exercise to try to hurry the baby up a bit. The night of Dec. 17, Gardner said, “we went walking” around the parking lot at First Baptist Church of Baldwyn, where Gardner is outreach pastor. Whether or not the exercise sped things up, Cade was born at 10:01 a.m. on Dec. 18 -- exactly 27 years after his parents’ birthdate. “Hillary is exactly six hours older than me,” Luke Gardner said. She was born at 8:10 a.m. and her husband at 2:10 p.m. on Dec. 18, 1989. They learned about their shared birthday before they started dating, while just part of a group of friends who hung out together. “I saw it on a Facebook page first and asked about it,” Gardner said. “I couldn’t really believe it when I saw it. I had to confirm it with her.” The chance of meeting someone born the same day as you is one in 365, explained Tumulesh Solanky, chair of the math department at the University of New Orleans. He said the chance of two people being born on the same day and having a baby on their birthday is about 1/365 times 1/365. “That comes out to .0000000751 -- seven zeros and then 751,” or about 7.5 in a million, he said, which comes to about one in 133,000. Statisticians note that this ignores such factors as leap years and the fact that births are not evenly spaced throughout the year. Gardner joked that if he and Hillary Gardner have more children, they may have to try for December. “If we have any more kids, if we don’t get pregnant in March, we’ll have to wait till the next year,” he said.   © 2017 The Associated Press.

Newborn shares birthday with mother, father Nell Luter Floyd, Clarion-Ledger correspondent Published 11:24 a.m. CT Jan. 10, 2017 | Updated 9:38 a.m. CT Jan. 11, 2017 CLOSE Cade Lee Gardner was born Dec. 18, 2016. He came on his own volition, with no induction of labor or planned C-section. His timing couldn't have been better, since now he shares the same birthday as his mother and father. Dustin Barnes/The Clarion-Ledger On Dec. 18, Cade Lee Gardner entered the world, bringing with him a family trifecta of sorts. He was born on the same date as both his parents, Hillary and Luke Gardner of Baldwyn. (Photo: Special to The Clarion-Ledger) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Pamela and Rod Cadenhead of Brandon marveled when their first grandchild was born — and with good reason. Cade Lee Gardner came into the world on Dec. 18, the same month and date his mother and father, Hillary and Luke Gardner of Baldwyn, did. “We all talked about how they might share the same birthday after we found out Hillary’s due date was Dec. 19,” said Rod Cadenhead, executive pastor of operations for Pinelake Church, which has locations at the Reservoir and in Madison, Clinton, Starkville and Oxford. Pamela Cadenheadl, wife of Rod Cadenhead, just knew Cade would be born on his parents’ birthday. “I just felt it was going to happen on that date,” she said. “I think it’s pretty neat.” Just in case you’re wondering, Cade appeared on his own volition. There was no induction of labor, no planned C-section. “This was totally natural,” said Hillary Gardner, 27, a graduate of Northwest Rankin High School and Mississippi State University who has worked as a real estate agent and is now a full-time mother. Hillary Gardner, whose best friend as a child was also born on Dec. 18, said that near her due date her obstetrician doubted there would be a birthday trifecta. Hillary Gardner took matters into her own hands and decided on Dec. 17 that a long walk might encourage labor to begin — and it did. Weighing 8 pounds, 1 ounce and measuring 20 inches long, Cade was born on Dec. 18 at 10:01 a.m. at Women’s Hospital in Tupelo. Luke Gardner, who grew up in Smithville, graduated from MSU and serves as children’s, evangelism and outreach pastor at First Baptist Church of Baldwyn, was also born there. Cade resembles his mother in facial features and has his father’s hair, Hillary Gardner said. The baby’s first name, Cade, is taken from Hillary Gardner’s maiden name, Cadenhead, and his middle name, Lee, is from Luke Gardner’s deceased father, Lee Gardner, who was pastor at Smithville Baptist Church for more than a decade. Ken Thompson, institutional researcher at Millsaps College in Jackson who teaches a class in elementary statistics, said it is very unlikely for a mother, father and their child to share the same birth date. “There are lots of variables at play,” he said. “To make it as simple as possible, let’s say that the distribution of birthdays throughout the year is uniform, that people are equally likely to be born on any given day of the year. This isn’t necessarily a true assumption, but it makes the interpretation much easier. I don’t know what the true distribution would be — babies are not likely to be conceived uniformly throughout the year — and let’s ignore leap years, which brings another level of complexity. “Given these ideal situations, the probability that a person is born on any given day of the year is 1/365, regardless of the day. The probability of being born on Dec. 18 is 1/365 for the mother, the father, and the son. “The probability of three independent events would be the product of the three probabilities. Thus, the probability of mom born on Dec. 18 and the probability of dad born on Dec. 18 and the probability of their son being born on Dec. 18 is (1/365)(1/365)(1/365), which is 0.000000021.” Wondering what plans the Gardners have for celebrating their joint birthdays? In the past, Hillary and Luke Gardner have visited retailers who give out free things to people on their birthdays, but Hillary Gardner expects that will change as Cade grows older. “We’ll be more about his birthday and less about ours,” she said.

Mom, dad, son all share a birthday     In a photo taken Dec. 24, 2016, by Luke Gardner with his cellphone on a timer, Luke and Hillary Gardner pose with their son Cade Lee in Baldwyn, Miss. The three share the same birthday.   Luke Gardner, AP        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Luke and Hillary Gardner never have a problem remembering each other’s birthday. After all, the husband and wife were born the same day. And so was their son, 27 years later this past December. The odds of that happening are about one in 133,000, statisticians say. And that’s a lot less likely than getting hit by lightning sometime in your lifetime, which some put at roughly one in 12,000. They weren’t aiming at a joint birthday when their son Cade Lee Gardner was conceived, said Luke Gardner, an assistant pastor at a Baptist church in northeast Mississippi and a student at a nearby campus of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. “I really didn’t even put it together until we got pregnant,” he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. “Then we realized, ‘Oh, wow!’” Using a smartphone app, he said, his wife calculated a due date of Dec. 15, three days before their joint birthday. Her obstetrician called it for Dec. 19. So the couple from Baldwyn, Mississippi, got in some exercise to try to hurry the baby up a bit. The night of Dec. 17, Gardner said, “we went walking” around the parking lot at First Baptist Church of Baldwyn, where Gardner is outreach pastor. Whether or not the exercise sped things up, Cade was born at 10:01 a.m. on Dec. 18 -- exactly 27 years after his parents’ birthdate. “Hillary is exactly six hours older than me,” Luke Gardner said. She was born at 8:10 a.m. and her husband at 2:10 p.m. on Dec. 18, 1989. They learned about their shared birthday before they started dating, while just part of a group of friends who hung out together. “I saw it on a Facebook page first and asked about it,” Gardner said. “I couldn’t really believe it when I saw it. I had to confirm it with her.” The chance of meeting someone born the same day as you is one in 365, explained Tumulesh Solanky, chair of the math department at the University of New Orleans. He said the chance of two people being born on the same day and having a baby on their birthday is about 1/365 times 1/365. “That comes out to .0000000751 -- seven zeros and then 751,” or about 7.5 in a million, he said, which comes to about one in 133,000. Statisticians note that this ignores such factors as leap years and the fact that births are not evenly spaced throughout the year. Gardner joked that if he and Hillary Gardner have more children, they may have to try for December. “If we have any more kids, if we don’t get pregnant in March, we’ll have to wait till the next year,” he said.   © 2017 The Associated Press.

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers   Jack Woida , Engineering and physics education; math hobby. Answered Feb 3, 2016 · Author has 488 answers and 1m answer views The chances of having your birthday on any given day of the year is 1/365.25 or about  0.274%.  So according to this you share a birthday with 0.274% of the people in the world, assuming births are randomly distributed throughout the year. But,. because 50% of these people are male and 50% are female, the chances that one of these people is your mother is half of this, or 0.137%. According to Mr. Google, that all knowing mystical font of information, the likelihood of a twin birth is about 3 in 100, or 3%. So the likelihood that you would share a birthday with a female who was a twin would be 3% times 0.137%, or roughly .0041%. I don't know how old you are.  There are about 7.4 B people in the world today, but let's assume that when you were born, there were only 6 B, and of these half, 3 B were female, and of these 60% were of child bearing age, roughly 1.8 B.  Then the odds that one of these were your mother would be 1 in 1.8 B. So now we combine the .0041% odds (the same as 1 in 24,350)  that you share a birthday with a female twin with the 1 in 1.8 B odds that any given female is your mother and we get one chance out of  43,830,000,000,000 of this happening. Actually I think the odds are probably even slimmer than that, since I thing the odds of having identical twins are even less than 3%. Anyway, that's my attempt at the math.  A professional statistician, smarter than me, may come along and correct me on this. 795 Views Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question Anonymous Answered Feb 3, 2016 Probability of being a twin is 3/100. 1/365 is the probability of having the same birthday. Not considering leap year and a birth day on February, 2. The provability you want is 3/36500. Not very rare. It's estimated to have 360000 child births a day. About 30 kids a day are born with your special case. 291 Views   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Answered Feb 4, 2016 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views I don't think I parse the question quite the same way that the other respondents have.  First, EVERYONE has a mother.  Every mother has a birthday.  So the probability that you share a birthday with your mother is roughly 1/365.  (It should be noted that I am ignoring leap days, but that approximation isn't as significant as is the fact that some days of the year are more likely than others to be birthdays for a handful of reasons that aren't worth discussing here.) Now, as for the twin part, given that you share a birthday with your mother and given that your mother has a twin (of any type), the probability that you share a birthday with the twin is very nearly one.  (It's possible but rare that the twins were born on consecutive days. In modern medicine, it is even possible, but EXCEEDINGLY rare for twins to be born weeks or even months apart.) So, since you have a mother and your mother has a mirror image twin, the probability that you all share a birthday is quite close to 1/365. However... Since the question says "you would share a birthday with your mother and her identical mirror image twin" my answer is zero as my mother has no twin. And finally, if we are to assume that you mean pick a person at random, what is the probability that this person has a mother who has a mirror image twin AND that all three share a birthday, we need to multiply the 1/365 probability discussed above by the probability that a person has a mirror image twin.  That probability is estimated at about 3/4000.  So the result is roughly 2 in a million. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Paul Robinson Thank you for your feedback!

I'm sure his answer is totally correct. You could also discuss the various technicalities of a coin flip. Sure, we might say that there's a 50% chance of heads, but maybe you flip your coins in a particular way, and the head side is slightly heavier than the other, and blah blah blah. It's totally correct to talk about these things, but sometimes it's more of a distraction than anything else. Simplifications are good! The simple answer is this: The chances that your kids would share the same birthday is 1/365 . Your first kid's birthday is July 23rd. So the only question there is: what is the odds of this other kid being born on July 23rd? 1/365. (Analogy: what are the odds of flipping a coin and getting the same thing twice? 1/2. This is just the odds of the second coin flip matching whatever the first one was.) The chances that both your kids are born on July 23rd specifically is 1/365*1/365. This is the first problem * the first problem. Both your kids now have to be born on July 23rd. (Analogy: what are the odds of getting heads twice? 1/2 for the first flip * 1/2 for the second flip. So 1/4.) This is the simple answer that you're looking for. 8.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

And the answer is fairly simple, although you'd have to make a few assumptions for the model in order to keep things simple. First, you assume that every child has a probability under uniform distribution of having a birthday on any given day of the year. Next, you assume that every child's probability is independent of other children's probabilities, i.e., having a child born on September 1st does not effect another child's probabilities. The question illustrates the importance of asking the right question, which is in fact: What is the probability that these two children do not share the same birthday? This is very simple. [math]\mathbb{P}(\mbox{different birthdays}) = \frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \approx .9973 [/math] To find out what the probability of these two children having the the same birthday, we simply say it is 1-.9973 = .0027 2k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Undo   Chong You Quan , prefers a euclidean world Answered Nov 20, 2012 · Author has 69 answers and 193.6k answer views Qiaochu Yuan's answer has covered much ground on this question. I would just like to present the answer in another way and include some of the factors that affect pregnancy and childbirth. We will first cover the math , then some other factors involved in childbirth. We shall use symbols [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] to denote the birthdays of the first and second child respectively. We consider 3 scenarios below, and the probabilities will become very clear. I will assume that there is no prior knowledge of when the children would be born before they are born and that there are no leap years involved here. 1. Before the children are born We have no knowledge of when the birthdays of the children would be (i.e. [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] are undetermined). There are two variables [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] , and each of them can take 365 possible values, so the probability that [math]x_1[/math] equals [math]x_2[/math] is (1/365)*(1/365)*365 = 1/365 . (The multiplication by 365 is due to the fact that there are 365 pairs of numbers that can match i.e. [math]x_1[/math] = [math]x_2[/math] =1, [math]x_1[/math] = [math]x_2[/math] = 2, ... and so on). 2. After the first child is born We now have knowledge of the birthday of the first child (i.e. [math]x_1[/math] is known, but [math]x_2[/math] is unknown. Thus, we have only one variable [math]x_2[/math] left (that can take 365 values), so the probability is 1/365 that it matches [math]x_1[/math] exactly. 3. After the second child is born We now have knowledge of the birthdays of both children, and there are no undetermined variables. So, we know that their birthdays match, with probability 1 . Now we have done the math, and I'll cover some factors that affect childbirth and pregnancy below: 1. Sex . Enough said. 2. Menstrual cycle of the mother Frequent sex does not exactly imply greater chance of conceiving a child. On day 14 of the average 28 day menstrual cycle, the egg leaves the ovary, entering the uterus, and it is called ovulation [1]. After that, the egg would begin to break apart 3 days after it leaves the ovary. It is during this crucial 3 day period that sex can result in conception . However, it must be noted that the length of menstrual cycles and times of egg release can vary (depending on the environment, stress levels, diet etc). For two children to be conceived at about the same time requires that the menstrual cycle somehow happen to coincide within the respective months (say, Nov 08 and Nov 11) that each child was conceived. 3. Gestation period Now, after the child is conceived, the gestation period would be about 9 months (266 days [2]). Boys usually take longer to gestate than girls [2]. About 50% of births occur within the first week of the estimated 266 days [3] (the online tool at [3] can calculate estimated date of birth based on conception date). All the above 3 factors must some miraculously combine exactly to result in that coincidence of the same birthdays of children. These factors are independent of the above math solely based on probability theory. Exact probabilities might be possible to obtain if we have more information on the first two factors above, but I will not delve into that. As a final note, for all we know, such coincidences in birthdays might be just purely divine luck (God has a plan for all of us, right?).

If you ask about the probability of the event that "your two kids are born in the same day of the year", then it is 1/365. If you ask about the probability of the event that "your two kids are both born on July 23rd", then it is 1/365 * 1/365. (Assuming the birthdays of your kids are independent and are equally likely to be any day of the year.) Most likely you are referring to the first event. We are only talking about classical probability here. Bayesian probability might give different answer, but isn't it a bit overkill? 2.5k Views · View Upvoters   Kamron Saniee , works at Zuse Institut Berlin Answered Dec 4, 2012 None of these answers engage the interesting case of some dependence on the children's birth dates (assuming they are born of the same mother). Of course 'ex post probabilities' are 1, and the 1/365 answer assumes independence. Dependence may be inferred from the '3 years' qualifier - note that if the children are born < 1 year apart the said probability is zero. A priori we must specify a distribution on conception after the first birth f(date T)=Pr(conceiving 2nd child on date T) to get a non trivial answer (the trivial answer 1/365 ~ f uniform, independent of T) and this answer will depend on f.

However, the dates of children's births may not be wholly random. I, for example was born in December so that my mother's maternity leave would finish just at the start of the school summer holidays (she was a teacher).

I'm assuming that you and your wife have a fertility rate of close to 100% under whatever conditions you created, although I would have to revise it if it took you a few months to get pregnant. I'll assume you had sex towards the end of October (was it the sexy nurse costume?), then Wikipedia:Gestation says the normal range is 37–42 weeks. Maybe this is a Gaussian distributed 39±1 weeks or 39±2 weeks. But then I would do the likelihood of them falling on the same day on the basis of that distribution because you're already given a much smaller range than 1/365 (apparently more like a 5-week range than a 52-week range). You can say the mean for Jenny Schneidermann 's gestation would be 39×7 and then do the probability that difference in those two gaussians would be zero. Of course her expected gestation time might not be the same as (Wikipedia's estimate of) the population avearge. Sum of normally distributed random variables If you didn't get pregnant right away, then I would revise the answer based on what you know about how frequently you had sex when, as well as other factors you two think might contribute to a successful conception. If you were having sex once a day every day for the whole year, no contraception or prophylactics, then I might use the 1/365 model. 851 Views   Zimu Yang , works at Georgia-Pacific Answered Oct 17, 2012 · Upvoted by  Vladimir Novakovski , Led machine learning at Quora It's 1/365 (assuming no leap year).

Undo Answer Wiki 4 Answers Quora User , Slacker Answered Apr 14, 2017 · Author has 702 answers and 943.3k answer views Unless I misunderstand the question, it is neither 1/365^2 or 1/365^3. It is 1/365. The probability of the parents sharing the same birthday is 1/1 (the parents must already share that birthday). Therefore, the probability is dependent on the only future event, the baby’s day of birth. Added in response to me understanding the question now! The question boils down to:  What is the chance that three random people have the same birthday, when each person’s birthday is unknown.  Married, related, or not; none of that matters (assuming people do not make marital decisions based on birthdays, or purposely try to match a pregnancy to an existing birthday).  Ignore February 29th for simplicity. The first person’s chance of having that birthday is 365/365, or 100%.  The first person defines the date, and it cannot be wrong as it equals itself. The second person has a 1/365 chance of having the same birthday as the first person, so the total probability is (365/365)*(1/365) or 1/365 = 0.274%. The third person has a 1/365 chance of having the same birthday as the first person, which is also (365/365)*(1/365) or 1/365 = 0.274%. So combined, it is (365/365)*(1/365)*(1/365) = 0.00075%, which is a probability of 1 in 133,225. The UberFact is wrong, they assumed a 1/365 chance for the first person, when the probability for that person is 1 as I note above. UberFact would be right if you chose a date in advance, say January 1st.  Then you go out and choose three people, and all of their birthdays were January 1st.  That probability is (1/365)*(1/365)*(1/365) = 0.00000206%, or 1 in 48,627,125. 138 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question   Corey Cole , I read "Lady Luck" once Answered Apr 14, 2017 · Author has 318 answers and 358.2k answer views As it happens, my son and his wife have the same birthday. They have no children yet. They could, if they so chose, back up about 9 months from their birthday, and try to conceive a child during that week. That would give them a reasonable chance of having a baby born on their mutual birthday. They could of course also choose to avoid that event. So I don’t see this as a probability question, because things like this are not entirely random. But let’s assume they are and restate the question: Given a random man and a random woman having a baby on a particular day, what is the chance they all have the same birthday. That would be 1 * 1/365.25 * 1/365.25. First person has a birthday on any day, second and third each match that day.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics) Birthdays: What's the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 6 Answers   Bhushan Shah , Interested, but largely ignorant Answered Sep 17, 2012 · Author has 59 answers and 118.6k answer views Easy approximate answer: ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) However, this is more complicated than it looks due to existence of leap years. What if your own birthday occurs on 29th Feb? To account for leap years, let us proceed as follows. Let the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date be p1 if your birthday is not on 29th Feb, and p2 if your birthday is on 29th Feb. The probability we are looking for is then the weighted average of p1 and p2, with the weights being the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not. Let us first calculate p1. Bear in mind that there are 97 leap years per 400 years. In these 97 years, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 1/366, and for the other 303 years it is 1/365. Hence, the value of p1 is ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 303 / 400 ) Now we calculate p2 in a similar manner. The only difference is that in the 303 years without a leap year, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 0. Hence, p2 becomes ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + 0 * ( 303 / 400 ) Now to calculate the overall probability, we consider the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not, which are used as weights for p2 and p1 respectively. The final expression then is, ( p1 * ( 303 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) ) + ( p2 * ( 97 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 366. ) ) This expression, which evaluates to 0.000623% (approx) is the accurate probability of meeting someone with the exact same birth date. As expected, this is slightly less than ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ), which is 0.000751%. Of course, this is assuming that all men are immortal, and that meeting someone born in 1900, in 1342, and in 2154 is equiprobable. If you want to take into account mortality, and eliminate people from the future, then this probability will become a function of the current date and time, and you will have to take into account stuff like demographics, average life expectancy etc. Let's not tread there! Though I reckon it wouldn't make much difference to the numerical value of the probability. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

The probability that x people don’t have the same birthday as you is [math](\frac{364}{365})^x[/math] . Let’s define the parameter n as the number of people you meet. So the probability that out of the n number of people you meet, none of them have the same birthday as you is [math](\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . So the probability that you meet at least 1 person who has the same birthday as you is [math]1-(\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . As a function of the number of people you’ve met, here is the probability that you have met someone who has the same birthday as you: Interestingly enough, you have to meet 1092 people before the probability that someone has the same birthday as you amongst the people you’ve met is greater than 95%. It takes 587 to surpass 80%, and a measly 253 to pass 50%. But wait… this assumes that the probability of someone else having the same birthday as you is [math]\frac{1}{365}[/math] . This isn’t the case. FiveThirtyEight did an analysis on this. Since cesarean sections (c-sections) are pre-scheduled, people often choose not to have it on days like Christmas or Christmas Eve, and, as such, fewer children are born on these days because only vaginally are children born on these days. Made by FiveThirtyEight with R . This is clearly a flaw in our logic. To account for this, people with birthdays that are above average line marked on this graph are more likely to find someone with the same birthday as them then someone with a birthday below the average line. So, someone born on July 9th would have an easier time finding people born on the same day as him than someone born on Christmas. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question   David Joyce , Professor of Mathematics at Clark University Updated Aug 13, 2014 · Author has 4.6k answers and 15m answer views The simplest model assumes that there are 365 days in a year, each sibling having the same probability of 1/365 of being born on any of those days, and their births are independent.  That implies the probability that they have the same birthday is 1/365. You can make improvements on this model is various ways.  For example, you can include leap days.  For that model you'd probably want to assume that the probability of being born on Feb 29 is 1/4 the probability of being born on any other day.  It complicates the computations a bit, and leads to a slightly lower probability for an answer. You could also get a table of the frequencies for births on each of the days of the year and weight the probabilities for each day to be proportional to those frequencies.  I don't know what answer that gives, but I suspect it would be slightly greater than 1/365. Finally, you could get some data on births of children in the same family.  You would find that they often occur in the same season, and even in the same month.  That means that the birthdays of siblings are not independent.  You might find that the probability of being born on the same day is 1/200 or higher. It would be interesting to know what that probability actually is. 22.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

So now, if we want to consider 1 year, we multiply that by 4, and it’ll become [math]\frac{4}{366+365*3}[/math] simplify that : [math]\frac{4}{1461} ~= 0.00273785078[/math] This happens if we forget the fact that if the year is divisible by 100 it’s not a leap year.

Statistics Blog > Same Birthday Odds  It stands to reason that same birthday odds for one person meeting another are 1/365 (365 days in the year and your birthday is on one of them).  But consider this: If you get a group of 30 people together, two of them will almost definitely have the same birthday. This blew my mind when I was a student.  There were 30 students in my undergrad statistics class and the professor said the odds of two of us having the same birthday were very high. In fact, two people in the class did have the same birthday. This didn’t seem to make sense to me, as there are 365 days in a year.  My Initial (Incorrect) Reasoning  The odds are 1/365 that I will meet another person with the same birthday. But we’re not talking about just me in a class. We’re talking about every student having those odds. It’s like if I had a 1/10 chance of winning the lottery and I meet another person who also has a 1/10 chance of winning the lottery, then combined we have a 2/10 chance of winning the lottery. The odds of a “coincidence” increases with each person:  Me meeting a person with the same birthday: 1/365 Me and one other friend meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/(365/2) = 183 Three of us meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/(365/3) = 1/122 … Twenty nine of us meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/12.  Those are pretty good odds, but not high enough to account for all those coincidences. That left me with a peculiar puzzle. The odds are actually much higher (over 100 percent for a class of 30).  The reason takes into account all of the possible combinations .  Why the Odds are Actually Much Higher!  One person has a 1/365 chance of meeting someone with the same birthday. Two people have a 1/183 chance of meeting someone with the same birthday. But! Those two people might also have the same birthday, right, so you have to add odds of 1/365 for that. The odds become 1/365 + 1/182.5 = 0.008, or .8 percent. Four people (lets call them ABCD) have a 1/91 chance, but there are 6 possible combinations (AB AC AD BD BC CD) so the probability becomes 1/91 + 6/365…and so on. You can see how it isn’t quite as easy as just x/365!  An Easier Way to Calculate Same Birthday Odds!  If there are 30 students in a class, there are 435 ways two students can be paired. The odds of a “match” become 1/12 + 435/365…which is much greater than 100 percent.  Seeing as the odds are 1/365 that any two students will match birthdays and there are 3 possible matches, it’s no surprise that two of those students share the same birthday. (Use the combinations calculator to figure the combinations out. It will also list all the possible name combinations if you really want to!).  Should I Perform This Experiment in Class?  I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t used this in class for the main reason that with 25 students in a class, the odds are a bit over 50/50 that this experiment will work. A second reason is that the above math is over simplified to be somewhat understandable . Even third or fourth year math majors will struggle a bit with the “true” probabilities behind why this works. Figuring out same birthday odds is very complex for many reasons including:   More people are born weekdays than weekends; mostly due to C-sections and induced births happening during the week, when doctors prefer to work.  Seasonal trends mean that more people are born in the summer than the winter.   Figuring out the true probabilities involves Bayesian logic; hop over to this Stanford University page for a more detailed explanation on Bayesian logic and same birthday odds.      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If you prefer an online interactive environment to learn R and statistics, this free R Tutorial by Datacamp is a great way to get started.

Same Birthday Odds: Higher Than You Think! was last modified: October 12th, 2017 by Stephanie     By Stephanie | October 3, 2014 | Statistics How To |    ← Predictive Analytics: Simple Definition and Real Life Examples  Probability Density Function/Probability Distribution Function: Definition, TI83 NormalPDF →    12 thoughts on “ Same Birthday Odds: Higher Than You Think! ”      Timmy September 16, 2015 at 9:47 am    Brilliant article. What i don´t understand is, how can the odds be “over 100 percent for a class of 30”? I thought it is impossible to get odds over 100 percent. At least this is what my teachers told me but they might be wrong.          Andale Post author September 17, 2015 at 12:22 pm    I’m 1000 percent certain your teacher was wrong ;) Just kidding. Your teacher is actually *technically* right. In statistics, the maximum probability IS 100 percent. But in “real life” we can be more than 100 percent certain about something, right? That’s one of the reasons the math behind this is mind boggling!          Paul December 15, 2016 at 6:04 am    What a brother and sister born the same day two years apart          Andale Post author December 19, 2016 at 9:13 am    The odds of two people being born on the same day are 1/365. Let’s say brother is born on Jan 1st. Sister can come along on that day…or one of 364 others.          Joanne March 2, 2017 at 5:36 pm    A friend of mine and I share the same birthday to the year and then we had our boys on the exact date! What are the odds of that?          Andale Post author March 3, 2017 at 7:32 am    I also had my son on my birthday ;) The question you are really asking is what are the odds of four people sharing the same birthday, or 1*1/365^3. That’s = .00000002 Or, “pretty small.” :)          Brandi June 7, 2017 at 3:21 pm    Just curious about the odds of someone sharing a birthday with thier maternal Grandmother AND paternal Grandfather. Any thoughts on that?          Andale Post author June 8, 2017 at 7:07 am    Wouldn’t it be just the same as three people sharing the same birthday? After all, the births of each person are independent.          Andrew September 28, 2017 at 7:02 am    I met someone at school who shares the same first name as I do as well as the same birthday, October 3rd.  Was just curious what the odds are of that.          Andale Post author September 28, 2017 at 10:48 am    You would have to know the ratio of how many Andrews there are in the U.S., out of all other names. If you can find that out, you can figure out the odds.          Tim October 1, 2017 at 7:59 am    There is one major flaw in your equation. The odds of meeting someone with the same birthday as you is not 1/365 because far more people are born in specific times of the year than other times. So the chances vary greatly depending on your exact birthday.          Tim October 1, 2017 at 8:02 am    Oops my bad, I did not read the last part that addresses that very thing.

We all know and love the blissful feeling of winning an argument. Well, trust me, that’s an even better feeling if you’re a mathematician.  It’s not a matter of finding the right words – rather it’s the right ideas applied in a rigorous manner. And when this is done properly, the winner of the argument becomes known to everyone in the room.      Jim Doran    The loser skulks back to his place of study, bloodied and bruised, to lick his or her wounds. What had seemed intuitively right is cancelled by a couple of lines of mathematics scrawled on the back of an envelope.  Maybe that’s why mathematicians live in harmony, at least most of the time. We understand that belief and intuition can guide us towards a result, but these are not vessels capable of delivering final proof.  The Monty Hall Problem, which I wrote about recently , is a fine example of simple mathematics defying general intuition. And when I say defying, I really mean guiding: every time we are subject to such a striking idea our intuition actually aligns itself just that little bit more with reality.  In the spirit of sharing more paradigm-shifting mathematical delights with you all, we will consider another problem which will hopefully tug your belief system that little bit more.  A simple question  So, again:   how many people do you have to put into a room before you are guaranteed that at least two of them share a birthday?      You say it’s your birthday; it’s my birthday too, yeah.  TheGiantVermin    The solution is fairly simple; there are 366 possible days (damn those leap years) that somebody can be born on. So if you had 367 people in a room, there’s no way to assign each of them a birthday without having to use a date more than once.  The above idea is known to mathematicians as the pigeonhole principle : if you have to sort items into pigeonholes, and there are more items than pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole has to contain more than one item.  The same principle lends itself to proving statements such as “in Sydney there will be at least two people with the same number of hairs on their head”.  A less simple question  Have a think about the following related problem:   How many people do you have to put into a room before you have a more than 50% chance that at least two of them share a birthday?   Most people guess 184, as this is a bit more than half of 366.  But the correct answer is actually 23. If you throw 23 randomly selected people into a room then it’s more likely than not that two of them share a birthday.  I’ve never seen anybody ballpark this number, or anything remotely close to it. It’s a counterintuitive result. Of course, I’m hoping that I can convince you with the following argument (calculators out, please).  The dirty details  Let’s make an assumption for simplicity, but this won’t void the argument. Just consider a regular year of 365 days and assume that all 365 birthdays are equally likely.  Sure, it’s known that in reality the birthdays of the population are subject to some variation but that’s OK – any sort of irregularities in reality would only increase the chances of a shared birthday.  So, we have a room of 23 people. We will actually calculate the probability that they all have different birthdays and show that this is less than 50%.  We walk in to our room, grab a person – Frank – and put him to the side. We then choose another person, Betty. The probability that Betty has a different birthday to Frank is 364/365, as there are 364 days in the year that Frank was not born on.  We then grab another person – Shazza – and bring her over to the side. There is a 363/365 probability Shazza doesn’t share a birthday with Frank and Betty, as there are 363 remaining days their birthday could fall on.     Frank, Betty and Shazza?  khelvan    If we keep doing this, bringing a person over and calculating the probability that they don’t share a birthday with the group before adding them to the group, we generate a bunch of probabilities:   364/365, 363/365, 362/365, … , 344/365, 343/365   The first probability arose from demanding that Frank and Betty do not share birthdays. The second probability has that Shazza doesn’t share a birthday with Frank or Betty. The probabilities continue in this way.  If we wanted to know the overall probability – that is, the probability that no two people share a birthday – we need to multiply together all of the above probabilities. In doing so we get that there is a 49.27% that none of them share a birthday, and this means that there is a 50.73% chance that at least two of them share a birthday!  You can have a go at repeating the calculation for numbers other than 23. In particular, you can prove that 22 people isn’t enough for a more than 50% chance. Also, 57 people will give you a 99% chance of a shared birthday!  Here’s a graph that shows the probability of a shared birthday given different numbers of people in a room.     BirthdayPlot.

Baby beats 48 million to one odds to be born on same day as BOTH parents  By Daily Mail Reporter    Updated: 12:05 EDT, 22 July 2011              e-mail           39  View comments     The birth of a baby is always a happy occasion but when Mason Parker came into the world - there was cause for a triple celebration. The newborn beat odds of 48 million to one to be born on Tuesday July 19th, which is also his mother Jacquie Parker's 29th birthday, and his father Paul's 32nd birthday. The couple, from Long Island, USA, 
revealed it was a race against the clock to deliver the healthy 8lb 4oz 
boy, as the minutes counted down to midnight.         Triple celebration: Mason Parker was born on the 19th July, sharing the same birthday as parents Jacquie and Paul, pictured at home in Long Island, New York  Paul, a package designer, said: 'When it looked like the baby was coming, the nurses called in the doctor. 'He didn't know until one of the nurses told him. He said: 'Which one?' She says: 'Both'. 'And he's like: 'We can have three birthdays today!'" The Parkers had been excited when Jacquie went into labour at 3am on Tuesday morning, a day before the due date of July 20th.         Race against the clock: The Parkers were excited when Jacquie went into labour at 3am on Tuesday morning, a day before the due date of July 20th        Proud mother: Jacquie gave birth to Mason naturally at 11.30pm  However, by the afternoon the contractions had stopped, and the couple believed they'd missed making it a triple celebration. But finally, 20 hours after the labour began, Jacquie's contractions started again, and she gave birth naturally at 11.30pm at North Shore Long Island Jewish Medical Center. 'As midnight kept getting closer, we started to lose hope,' said Paul. 'It was barely July 19th, but it was a wonderful end to the day." Jacquie said: 'I never thought it would actually happen. 'Being in labour isn't the way you'd choose to spend your birthday, but it was definitely worth it.' The couple, who had been planning to have a quiet restaurant meal for their joint birthdays, say they now have a much better reason to celebrate. And they are already planning a special party next year to mark Jacquie's 30th, and her son's first birthday. 'I'll be planning the big bash for both birthdays,' said Paul, 'I don't mind getting just a cupcake.'

I had my DD  (dear daughter) 11 days early, so it is very possible to have this baby early too. At first I thought it would be soooo cool to have baby on my bday.... then I thought more about it.  As selfish as it sounds, you never would get to do anything really special for YOUR bday. I mean yeah, you could kinda do parties together or whatever, but what if you really wanted to go out and have a drink or do something with just you DH  (dear husband) and your friends?  I would rather cross my legs on that particular day now ;)      --  Kristin ~ Layla Mae   08/18/06 ~ Charlotte Paige   11/3/10             Reply            Report this comment       0                     heffy0929    Posted 05/14/2009      I am due on November 11th and my birthday is November 9th.

I share my birthday with my mom and it's the BEST thing ever. Every year we celebrate together and it's such a great feeling be able to have that bond that not many people have. I would LOVE to have a baby on my birthday because it a gift that you will remember for the rest of your life and (not like you could forget the day you gave birth) it's a wonderful feeling sharing it with someone you are so close to and look up to so much. Good luck.... :)    --  Mommy Shara and Daddy Steve             Reply            Report this comment       0               / 3      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

One born the same month as me and the other 2 were also born in the same month. So we got to hear a lot of wow September and December were the getting busy months for your parents huh?! Birthdays were never special bc they were all about the youngest one.  Maybe that's just my experience but I'll do my best not to have another LO  (little one) in June.

My husband was born on the 19th His brother on the 24th His sister on the 27th. I don't know how it was for them growing up, but now it's fun. We do one big birthday celebration for all three. It's a blast. It's hard to schedule time together anyways so it's nice only have to get together once for three birthdays. Also my MIL  (mother-in-law) and FIL  (father-in-law) have birthdays a week a part. And my cousins who are sisters have the exact same birthday, two years apart.  So to me it's like, who cares? You can do combine parties, or separate parties, or whatever. It'll work out.

A birthday is special no matter the day if you make it special.  We give our twins their own cake and this year they want separate parties.  My 4 year old wants to have a joint party with the youngest this year and that's what we will do.

It is what it is. I wouldn't do it on purpose, but I wouldn't not try because of the month. I like that they have spring birthdays because it is far from Christmas. It is nice that the girls are born in the same season to reuse clothes. .  As someone who is a twin - and has always shared my birthday anyway - I guess I have never really thought of it as a big deal. We do our best to make each birthday special for them.    --  May 2006 , April 2009 , June 2013             Reply            Report this comment       0                     rystenk    Posted 09/15/2014      i agree with the PPs that its what you make of it. selfishly i want to reuse all the baby crap i have if i have another boy. but i know that me & DH  (dear husband) would make each childs birthday special regardless.

GraceNMad+1    See original post     Posted 11/13/2008       I had my appt. this morning (I'm 37w 3d - due on the 1st) and my doctor asked if I wanted to set up anything in terms of an induction... I'm 2.5 - 3 cm., don't know effacement or anything, just that my cervix is really soft and the baby is extremely low... she sounded like she was pretty much as low as she could be.  So, she said if I wanted she'd induce me Mon. 11-24 (I'd be 39 weeks) that way I could be home on Wed. 11-26 (my birthday) and be home for Thanksgiving the next day.  I'm not crazy about the idea of induction, I'd rather go into labor naturally, but I also don't want to have to go past my due date.  Anyway, she said she would just put me down to save the spot and if I change my mind we'll cancel it, but otherwise it will fill up and if I decide I want to do it I won't be able to.  So I told her to put me down for the 26th since I figured I might as well give myself a couple of more days... plus I thought it would be neat to have the baby on my birthday!  So, my DH  (dear husband) thinks the baby should have her own birthday (and that I should too.)  So he thinks if I'm going to do it at all I should go for Monday 11-24 but that obviously it's up to me.  Now I'm wondering if he's right, if I shouldn't have the baby on my own birthday... plus, my 4 year old's birthday is on Halloween, so if this baby has the same birthday as me I wonder if my middle DD  (dear daughter) will feel left out??  Sorry this is long - what do you think??  I'm not sure if I'll do it at all, but if I do would you go for Mon. or Wed.?  I know it would be nice to be home for Thanksgiving too, but I don't want to push up her birthday just for that.

My BIL  (brother-in-law) just got married and picked my son's birthday. That drove me crazy though just because they had control over their wedding date.  On another note, a friend at work has two kids that were born two years apart, but they share the same birthday.  The kids don't like it at all.  I don't think I want that, but me sharing a birthday with a child wouldn't matter.

I'm a mommy damn it, I deserve a night out once in a while too! lol If baby had the same bday I would feel bad if I wanted to go out to dinner with hubby or something and I get a babysitter for the LO  (little one) ON HIS BDAY!! I dunno, that's just my opinion though. I did talk to the doctor about inducing on the 9th not really for this reason but that is a bonus if I decide to go ahead with it.

My brother said this being the case, he preferred that his son was born on his birthday (no induction, it just happened that way) than a couple of days off, because then one of them would always be celebrating on a day OTHER than their birthday, you know?  And my brother, like PP, also said he'd had plenty of birthday celebrations and was glad to be celebrating his son's instead.  FWIW, I agree with PP  (previous poster) about the inductions - I would just go naturally and see what happens.    --  Mommy to DS(9), DS(6), and DS(3). SM to DSS(16).

Does anyone see the flaws?   This is what can happen when statistics are abused.    A very happy birthday! Baby beats 48 million to one odds to be born on same day as BOTH parents  The birth of a baby is always a happy occasion but when Mason Parker came into the world – there was cause for a triple celebration.  The newborn beat odds of 48 million to one to be born on Tuesday July 19th, which is also his mother Jacquie Parker’s 29th birthday, and his father Paul’s 32nd birthday.  The couple, from Long Island, USA, revealed it was a race against the clock to deliver the healthy 8lb 4oz boy, as the minutes counted down to midnight.  Paul, a package designer, said: ‘When it looked like the baby was coming, the nurses called in the doctor.  ‘He didn’t know until one of the nurses told him. He said: ‘Which one?’ She says: ‘Both’.  ‘And he’s like: ‘We can have three birthdays today!'”  The Parkers had been excited when Jacquie went into labour at 3am on Tuesday morning, a day before the due date of July 20th.  However, by the afternoon the contractions had stopped, and the couple believed they’d missed making it a triple celebration.  But finally, 20 hours after the labour began, Jacquie’s contractions started again, and she gave birth naturally at 11.30pm at North Shore Long Island Jewish Medical Center.  ‘As midnight kept getting closer, we started to lose hope,’ said Paul.  ‘It was barely July 19th, but it was a wonderful end to the day.”  Jacquie said: ‘I never thought it would actually happen.  ‘Being in labour isn’t the way you’d choose to spend your birthday, but it was definitely worth it.’  The couple, who had been planning to have a quiet restaurant meal for their joint birthdays, say they now have a much better reason to celebrate.  And they are already planning a special party next year to mark Jacquie’s 30th, and her son’s first birthday.  ‘I’ll be planning the big bash for both birthdays,’ said Paul, ‘I don’t mind getting just a cupcake.’                     July 27, 2011 2:40 pm at 2:40 pm  #790936       ronrsr Member    Yes, the odds the baby beat are only 365  to 1.   The bithdays are independent events, and the parents already shared birthdays.       July 27, 2011 2:46 pm at 2:46 pm  #790937       zahavasdad Participant    The odds are   365*365*365 = 48 Million   The odds of a person being born on a day are 365 to 1 and the odds of 2 people being born on the same day are 365 * 365 to 1.       July 27, 2011 2:51 pm at 2:51 pm  #790938       adorable Participant    heard about this a couple of days ago! very very cool       July 27, 2011 2:56 pm at 2:56 pm  #790939       Feif Un Participant    ronrsr and zahavasdad, you’re both right. If it was taking 2 random people, and having them have a baby, the odds would be 1/48 million. Since the couple was already married, that part is already given, so it’s only 1/365.

Note that in any random group of 23 people, there’s a 50% chance that two people will share a birthday, a statistic that jumps to 99% with 57 people, and of course 100% with 366 people. see, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem        July 27, 2011 3:25 pm at 3:25 pm  #790942       eman Participant    If you take 100 random people (say a shul) the odds are on your side that 2 people have the same birthday.       July 27, 2011 3:29 pm at 3:29 pm  #790943       oomis Participant    My first child was born on my mother-in-law’s birthday, my second (a girl)was born on my mother’s birthday. My third (another girl)was born on my MIL and son’s birthday, and my fourth (also a girl)was born less than an hour too late to make my mother and daughter’s birthday. My fifth child, a boy was not born on anyone else’s birthday in the family, but his bar-mitzvah parsha was the same one as his big brother. Should I notify the NY Post now or later?

July 27, 2011 4:02 pm at 4:02 pm  #790947       on the ball Participant    I can only try:   You’re right but still given the parents shared their birthday before the baby was born, the correct headline should have been ‘Family (not baby) beats 133,225 to 1 odds’ the Baby merely beat a puny 365/1 odds.   This article reminds me of the story of a guy who always wore his hat on backwards when he went on a plane. When he was asked why he replied “Well the odds of there being a bomb on the plane is estimated at 1 million to 1. What do you think are the odds of there being a bomb on a plane with a passenger who’s hat is on backwards?”       July 27, 2011 4:10 pm at 4:10 pm  #790948       ronrsr Member    Yes, that complicates things.  Plus, birthdays aren’t evenly distributed across every day of the year, as you might expect.  More babies are born on certain dates and certain times if the year.       July 27, 2011 4:29 pm at 4:29 pm  #790949       LeiderLeider… Participant    This is what’s confusing and inherently untrue about statistics. And it’s unfortunate that our business and our country are run off such flawed statistics.   The odds of an individual being born on a given day is 1/365. Period. The fact that the parents also have the same birthdates has no effect whatsoever on this statistic.   If I were to wager on which date a child will be born I would look at it as a 1/365 chance irrespective of what his parents birthdates are. Also, the chances of being born on a particular hour is 1/24, irrespective of the hour his parents were born.   The chances of an individual winning a lottery ticket does NOT diminish just because they have previously won the lotto. Their chances are exactly the same!   So, I need to be convinced here of the legitimacy of these statistics.       July 27, 2011 4:31 pm at 4:31 pm  #790950       LeiderLeider… Participant    on the ball: thank you! your example illustrates the inherent flaws in following such statistics.       July 27, 2011 5:06 pm at 5:06 pm  #790951       on the ball Participant    Leiderleider – don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Not all statistics are flawed (only 35.7% are).   As I pointed out – if the headline would have read : ‘Family beats 1 in 133,225 odds” that would have been a perfectly correct statistic (allowing for very slight seasonal fluctuations)   The chances of winning the lotto twice are tiny. But having won it once – you’re half way there already! Now you’re chance of winning it again are the same as everybody.       July 27, 2011 5:21 pm at 5:21 pm  #790952       Dr. Pepper Participant    Since I’m the OP I guess I have the responsibility to add to the discussion.   The way I look at it is:  Guy- birthday is insignificant since as of now any birthday will satisfy the study.   Wife- The odds that he will pick a wife with the same birthday is 1/365 (assuming that there are no leap years).   Child- The odds that the child will be born on the same birthday as the two of them is also 1/365 (again, ignoring leap years).   Therefore overall odds are (ignoring the possibility that mother nature was manipulated) are 1/133,225.   One of my favorite abuses of statistics comes from a conversation between two friends who were driving to Colorado.   About ten minutes into the trip the driver floors the gas. When questioned he explained that statistically speaking, a driver has the biggest chance of having an accident within five miles of where they live, since they already passed five miles he could let down his guard.   “But what about the people whose five mile radius we just entered?”       July 27, 2011 5:21 pm at 5:21 pm  #790953       zaidy78 Member    As someone whos parents have the same birthday, as well as a sister, it’s not so cool after all.   Let me explain. The chances in real life is that if you have forty people in a room, 2 will have the same birthday. Many classes with even smaller numbers have two students with the same birthday. Why? Because there are certain months with more births (a discussion for another time and another place – see gmara megilla that chodesh haRivIi (Teves, when Esther was taken to Achashvarosh – chodesh sheNihena HaGuf MayHaGuf).   So the chances are not 1:365 but rather 1:40.   And anyway, my sister isn’t so special, (but of course, if you take into consideration her awesome brother, she is great)!!

                                122 comments            I have never had a very good relationship with Mathematics. I used to think it was me… I thought that perhaps I was just a bit put off by Math’s confident demeanor and superior attitude, and by its tendency to micromanage every tiny detail of my universe. But over time I have come to the realization that I’m not the source of the problem. Math, as it turns out, is out of its bloody mind.  Consider the following example: Assuming for a moment that birthdays are evenly distributed throughout the year, if you’re sitting in a room with forty people in it, what are the chances that two of those people have the same birthday? For simplicity’s sake, we’ll ignore leap years. A reasonable, intelligent person might point out that the odds don’t reach 100% until there are 366 people in the room (the number of days in a year + 1)… and forty is about 11% of 366… so such a person might conclude that the odds of two people in forty sharing a birthday are about 11%. In reality, due to Math’s convoluted reasoning, the odds are about 90%. This phenomenon is known as the Birthday Paradox .  →  If the set of people is increased to sixty, the odds climb to above 99%. This means that with only sixty people in a room, even though there are 365 possible birthdays, it is almost certain that two people have a birthday on the same day. After making these preposterous assertions, Math then goes on to rationalize its claims by recruiting its bastard offspring: numbers and formulas .  It’s tricky to explain the phenomenon in a way that feels intuitive. You can consider the fact that forty people can be paired up in 780 unique ways, and it follows that there would be a good chance that at least one of those pairs would share a birthday. But that doesn’t really satisfy the question for me, it just feels marginally less screwy. So I did something quite out of character: I crunched the numbers. The values rapidly become unmanageable, but the trend is clear:     # of people  Possible combinations of birthdays  # of those combinations where at least two birthdays fall on the same day  % of combinations where two people have same birthday    1  365  0  0.0%    2  133,225  365  0.2%    3  48,627,125  398,945  0.8%    4  17,748,900,625  290,299,465  1.6%    5  6,478,348,728,125  175,793,709,365  2.7%    6  2,364,597,285,765,625  95,677,479,012,025  4.0%    7  863,078,009,304,453,125  48,535,798,679,910,725  5.6%    8  315,023,473,396,125,390,625  23,417,361,992,539,211,425  7.4%    9  IF YOU PUSH THAT EQUALS BUTTON I WILL MAKE YOU BLEED. SINCERELY, YOUR CALCULATOR. END OF LINE.  5318008  —-     Only calculating up to eight people, we see that of the three hundred fifteen quintillion possible combinations of birthdays the group has, 7.4% of cases— or about one in thirteen— result in two of them having the same birthday. As each person is added, the odds do not increase linearly, but rather they curve upwards rapidly. This trend continues up to around twenty-three people, where the curve hits 50% odds, and the rate of increase starts going down. It practically flattens out when fifty-seven people are considered, and the odds rest at about 99%. Though it may not be intuitive, the numbers follow the pattern quite faithfully.  So does this mean that you can walk into a math class of forty students, bet them that at least two people in the room share a birthday, and win 90% of the time? Not exactly. In real life, where Math is not particularly welcome, birthdays are not distributed perfectly throughout the year. More people are born in the springtime, which throws the numbers off. Also, as a result of the way that hospitals operate, more babies are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends, which further complicates the problem. Depending on the group of people and how evenly distributed their birthdays are, the results can vary widely. But most of the time, you’ll still have some very good odds.   But there is at least one highly practical application for this numerical phenomenon: computer hacking. There is a classic cryptographic computer attack known as the “birthday attack” which exploits the math of the birthday paradox. Using this method, a programmer can store the results of the birthday math in memory to decrease overall processing time when doing certain computationally useful things, such as attempting to crack a digital signature.  Another thing that I discovered in my research is that a one followed by fifty-one zeros is called one sexdecillion . I knew those mathematician guys were hiding something in those big numbers.  As much as Math would like us to think that it is an advocate for structure and intuition, every once in a while it churns up something dastardly and unintuitive like the Birthday Paradox, the Monty Hall problem or Benford’s Law . And we have no choice but to obey these fickle whims of the great control freak. But every once in a while, I like to divide by zero, just to show Math that I’m not powerless to retaliate.  To those who would claim that only a fool would fall prey to the Birthday Paradox, and that the true nature of the odds is perfectly intuitive, I ask this of your Rainman-like grasp of numbers… why is it that all of the totals in this article’s first chart (aside from zero) end in the digit five? That outcome surprised me, but I currently lack the conviction to pursue the matter. I now see that numbers represent all that is soulless and wrong.      written by Alan Bellows , copyright © 09 February 2006.

Furnace  Posted 10 February 2006 at 05:07 am      I had heard in the past that the odds are more like 1 in 28, but it could depend on radical variables right down to the region one lives.  Plus, you have people that try to give a child a specific birthday (specifically New Year’s Day and Christmas) and that complicates the math even further.  To add an interesting bit of reality… my birthday is Feb. 24th.  Anyone else?       PDLagasse  Posted 10 February 2006 at 06:18 am      Birthday distribution isn’t governed solely by logical and rational factors. There’s also biology (“that time of month”), sociology (“not tonight, dear”), and heck, even climatology sometimes (“it’s too hot to have sex tonight”). Those messy variables are enough to cock up (NPI) any distribution, it seems to me…       Cynthia Wood  Posted 10 February 2006 at 06:41 am      Climatology affects things on the other side too. Ask any ER physician or obstetrician – more women will go into labor during a thunderstorm. Also during full moons, but that’s not climatology, strictly speaking.

It held me up because I couldn’t solve a logical equation and set aside contemplating some magically witchcrafted non-number. “What’s in this soup?” “We don’t know, nobody knows! Just shut up and eat it!”       Alan Bellows  Posted 10 February 2006 at 09:47 am      karphi said: “I remember asking my math teacher back in the day to explain “i”, the variable that equals the square root of negative one.

Ps: Ten more days– Feb. 20th– until I am twenty-one. I rule.       dmwit  Posted 10 February 2006 at 12:36 pm      Here is an intuitive way to think of it:  What are the odds that no two people have the same birthday?  Well, order the people.  Then the first guy has his own birthday.  For the second guy, there are only 364 choices out of 365, the second guy has only 363/365, and so forth.  So the odds of forty people having unique birthdays is like  364/365*363/365*…*326/365  We can approximate this by taking the middle factor and raising it to the fortieth power, so we get about (345/365)^40, which is very small because of the large power to which it is raised.  So the chance of two people sharing is just 1-(345/365)^40, which is near to one, that is, there is a very good chance of having it happen.  (Incidentally, that works out to about .895 or 89.5%, very close to the 90% quoted in the text.)       Tynan  Posted 10 February 2006 at 12:38 pm      Actually, I think that any factor that skews the birthdays towards any uneven distribution will actually strengthen this law. For example, does more people being born in springtime increase the chance that two people in any room will have the same birthday?  Actually this is sort of interesting… perhaps I’ll see if I can come up with a formal proof for it some time.       buckyboy314  Posted 10 February 2006 at 02:25 pm      Well, yes, so long as the people are selected at random from a population, changing the probability of being born on different days from a 50/50 chance will increase the chance of coincidence. For example, say you have two days, and the probability of being born on the first of the two is p1 and the second p2. The chance of a coincidence on either day is p1*p1+p2*p2=p1^2+p2^2=2 p1^2 (Substitute p1 for p2 because the chance is equal). Now changing p1 and p2 so they still add up to the same value, you get the probability of coincidence (p1+x)*(p1+x)+(p2-x)*(p2-x)=p1^2+2p1x+x^2+p2^2-2xp2+x^2=2pi^2+x^2. Because x^2 is always a real number, the term x^2 is positive and thus a uniform distribution in fact causes the least coincidence.  Speaking  of x^2 being always positive, the other topic of discussion that crept in here, complex numbers, is quite interesting. Recall grade school when you came across fractions. A simple fraction a/b is a solution to the problem a=bx, when finding the value of x (if b does not divide a evenly). It is not a “number” by any definition you had  before that. And later on, when you learned of irrational numbers like sqrt(2), they did not fit the previous definition of numbers. So too is i a mathematical solution to a number question that was previously unsolvable. The really cool thing, though, is that if you assign a letter to i and do some operations on it, you get amazing consequences. For  example the fascinating formula e^(pi i) + 1=0 and the beautiful Mandelbrot set. In fact, there are more complex systems of imaginary numbers than just i, such as the quaternions, which use i,j,and k. But to define them in unique ways, even more of your familiar mathematical laws have to go out the window.       Scott Bowers  Posted 10 February 2006 at 02:35 pm      Great article.   My network security class was just talking about this the other day, and today(2-10) is my birth day….weird…       Pteromys  Posted 10 February 2006 at 02:36 pm      For the curious, why the number in the second column is always 5 (except for the first and last entries):  RichUK said that the number in the first column is a power of 365 and that it always ends in 5. If we subtract from that the number of ways for no two people to have the same birthday, we should get the number in the second column.  According to dmwit, the number of ways for no two people to have the same birthday equals 365*364*363*(lots more numbers). As long as we have at least two people, we’ll have 365 and 364 in that product, which will make it a multiple of 10. (And if we have more than 365 people, then there are no ways for no two people to have the same birthday, and zero is still a multiple of 10.)  Since the number of ways for no two people to have the same birthday is a multiple of 10, then subtracting it from the number in the first column will leave the last digit (5) unchanged. So as long as we have at least two people, the last digit of the number in the second column is 5.       Clay  Posted 10 February 2006 at 03:12 pm      February 24th here!  What’s UP with that?       ke4roh  Posted 10 February 2006 at 05:39 pm      Probability is about counting things.  Counting is pretty easy, so long as you’re careful to count the right thing, and those blasted formulas just simplify the counting a little.  Say you want to know the odds that any 2 people in a group will have the same birthday (and let’s assume they’re evenly distributed even though they are clumped towards the spring). It’s easier to count how likely they are to not have the same birthday: the first person in the room can have any birthday at all, the second has only 364 possible days without conflict, the third has only 363 days, and so forth.  But consider that the people didn’t choose their birthdays – they were all picked at random from the same set of 365, not from that constrained set.  Coincidences are bound to arise.  What, then, does the table count?  Certainly not the same thing.  It’s counting the ways in which birthdays of individual people can be arranged – person A could be born on any of 365 days, person B on any of 365 days, and person C on any of 365 days.  True enough, but it accounts for people as individuals rather than considering them as a group.  In fact, the birthday paradox formula accounts for the individuals, too, but the denominator cancels them out.       TheEstablishment  Posted 10 February 2006 at 06:30 pm      5318008  Nice.

Or you can go around thinking about it and looking for examples until it gradually sneaks into your intuiton.  Ill give a couple of examples.  take a 6 digit license plate for simplicity sake we will say each character can only be a digit 0-9 no letters. if we have just one digit then we have ten combinations 0-9.  If we have have 2 characters we have one hundred combinations 0-99 3: 0-999          1000 combinations 10^3 4: 0-9999       10000 combinations 10^4 5: 0-99999     100000 combinations 10^5 6: 0-999999  1000000 combinations 10^6  you just multiply the number of combinations for any one character by the number of combinations for any other character.  10*10*10*10*10*10 or 10^6.  if you had letters too, then each character would have 36 possible combinations 0-9 +a-z =36 then you calculate 36^6 = 2176782336 possible combinations.  And Briefly there is the binary number system which i find to be a simple demonstration of this concept but you might not.  As you may know the binary number system is base 2 meaning each digit can only be a 0 or a 1.  in binary you count like this  0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111,1000  with one digit there are two combinations 0 or one 0   1 with two digits there are four combintations 2^2 0  0 0  1 1  0 1   1 three digits make for eight combinations 2^3 0  0 0  1 1  0 1   1 1   0   0 1   0   1 1   1   0 1   1   1  and so on  with simple probablity it is always (possible combinations for any one variable)^(number of variables)  hope i helped… if i didnt i just wasted an aweful lot of time at work       mrjondoe  Posted 11 February 2006 at 11:03 am      joe:  the reason that there are 133,225 possible combinations for 2 peoples birthday is fairly simple.  person 1 can be born on 365 days, and person 2, likewise on 365 days.  so the number of combinations is number of ways to choose person 1’s birthday times the number of ways to choose person 2’s birthday, or 365 *365 = 133,225  may 31st here       po8  Posted 11 February 2006 at 11:16 am      I don’t think the Birthday Paradox is that complicated to understand.  First, let’s get away from the math for a bit.  What if there are 367 people (curse you, Feb 29) in a room?  What then is the probability that two of them have the same birthday?  Why, it’s guaranteed that two do!  The “pigeonhole principle” says that if you keep picking unique birthdays for folks in the room, you will run out of unique birthdays before you run out of folks.  Now, let’s do a tiny bit of math.  Suppose there are 120 folks in the room and they all have unique birthdays.  Then what are the odds that a 121st person with a randomly selected birthday has the same birthday as one of them?  Well, about 1/3…1/3 of the unique birthdays are taken, and the other 2/3s aren’t.  That’s pretty good odds, still.  But now think of it this way…imagine we start with 120 unique birthdays in the room, and add people #121..#130.  Each of these folks has a roughly 1/3 chance of colliding with the original 120.  So now you ask, “what are the odds that in 10 tries you don’t roll 1 or 2 on a six-sided die?”   In other words, what are the odds that you fail to achieve a 1/3 probability in 10 tries?  The answer, it turns out, is 2/3 to the 10th power, which is a little less than 2%.  If this is counterintuitive to you, get a die and try it.  You’ll likely get bored before you get through 10 rolls of just 3..6.  So it seems clear that if 130 people were in the room, two would almost certainly have the same birthday, because even if the first 120 didn’t contain such a pair, one of the next 10 would.  Now, it should all be coming clear.  Imagine that instead we’d started with 110 people in the room and worked up to 120.  By exactly the same logic, the odds would be almost identical. So in a room with 120 people, it’s still almost certain that two will have the same birthday.  You see where this is going.  Since with two people in the room, there’s little chance they’ll have the same birthday, the number of people for which the chance of a same birthday is 50% is going to be somewhere between 2 and 120 (already less than half), but by our math it looks way closer to 2 than 120.  If you’re mathematically sophisticated, you can now write down the right equation to get the number of people achieving a 50% chance.  If not, you can look it up.  Hopefully, this is clear.  I think I didn’t make any giant leaps.  Let me know if I am wrong.       shivers  Posted 11 February 2006 at 11:50 am      I made a computer application that helps people understand the paradox.

(e.g., the deci-mal system)  Million means 1,000 times 1,000. Billion means 1,000 times 1,000 twice—“bi-” meaning “two”. Sextillion, then, means 1000 times 1,000 ^ 6, which is 10^21 or 10 with 21 zeros after it. Sexdecillion, therefore, is simply a mangled Latin-inspired way of saying 1,000 times 1,000 16 times.  If there’s anything dirty about the name, it’d be its liberal “borrowing” of grammar and vocabulary from dead languages.       MrDlCastle  Posted 11 February 2006 at 01:50 pm      You all probably have heard of this one.  But if you look at the year you are born and then the year your father is born (or mother).  When you reach their year in age (for example if they were born in 1933, then when you reach 33), they will be the year you were born. I thought this was kind of cool.  I think it breaks somewhere, but I think it holds true for all those up to 1999.  Try it. Carlos (Of course if you were adopted or otherwise not born of your parents then this wouldn’t work).

Ok… let’s count this one up, and ignore the leap years to make things easier.  What are the odds of you both being born on 3/13?  Well, the odds of you being born on 3/13 are 1 in 365, but you walked into the room with that birthday, so it was a foregone conclusion and gave the date significance, so that much is a probability of 1.  The odds of your room mate having the same birthday (nevermind year), are 1 in 365 (assuming evenly distributed birthdays).  To answer the question of the same year, again, it’s a foregone conclusion that you were born in 1979, so those odds are 1.  What are the odds of the mate having the same birth year?  Probably pretty good.  It depends on a zillion factors – how you met the person and life circumstances.  Let’s assume you put an ad in the paper and took the first caller.  Let’s assume the caller would be at least 18 years old, and not more than… (and here’s the whopper of a guess) 40.  The ages of people with room mates in the United States (where I am – but I don’t know where you are), probably favors the 18-30 group.  Others tend to get married or get their own places.  An octagenarian might have called you up, too, so we shift the guess a little to the higher end.  So… assuming (wild assumption) that the years are evenly distributed amongst the ages 18 and 40, birth years are from 1965 to 1987, inclusive, a 23 year span.  We’ll say, then, that there was a 1/23 chance of your having the same birth year as your roommate.   A more complicated approach would probably show that it was more likely for you to have a similar birth year, with odds possibly as good as 1/6…  So 1/23 (odds of same year as you) * 1/365 (odds of same day as you) = 1/8395.  Bear in mind that my estimates of odds for your birthday collision are pessimistic.  An optomistic answer would consider that birthdays are clustered towards the spring… oh, a 1/200 chance of March 13, we might say… And we could suppose that your roommate would be within 4 years of your age for compatibility’s sake, reducing to 9 the number of possible years… 1/9 chance… and if those estimates are close, the 1/1800 odds aren’t so long as you might have imagined.  (Of course, for those born in August, the odds are not so good.)  To test it: survey at least 30,000 roommates in different dwellings and ask them if they have the same birthdate.  Then you’ll have an imperical estimate ;-)  Good luck!  I remember not too many years ago a lottery number came up “0 0 0 0” in a game where you pick four digits from 0 to 9 in order (obviously, for the probability pedants reading, with replacement).  When someone actually won with that number, a reporter asked of a lottery person, “what are the odds?”  She didn’t know!  Well… there are 10,000 possibilities with each as likely as the others, so the odds were 1 in 10,000.  You’d think the lottery folks would know that!  Your odds of having met the roommate with the same birthday are undoubtedly better than your chance of winning at that particular lottery game.

Obviously I hardly understand anything that’s going on within the article nor the explanations nor the little application that i downloaded to explain the b-day paradox.  I never really understood my math teachers either.  I see a pattern though.  When one explains abstract mathematical concepts in the most simple terms, I only get more confused.  There’s a part of my brain that went out for lunch, won the lottery with the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 then fell in love with someone born on the same day, got struck by lightning while being attacked by a shark, and never came back.  What are the odds of that one?  I dare you to answer.  I also believe that mathematics is the purest language, probably that’s why it is beyond my reach.  Great article though, great responses, but how would i know, i hardly understood anything, it’s just a hunch.  I did understand the whole “sex” episode and then you lost me straight away when the numbers came in (just kidding, i’m not that dumb).

You’ve sent me on a quest to analyze all the birthday numbers I could find!  And I don’t have time!  Argh….   Anyhow, I analyzed the aforementioned 1978 birthday numbers.  There is a weekly pattern (presumably fewer births on the weekend, but I didn’t look at that in detail).  There is also a gradual trend towards more births as the year goes on (as one might expect with population increase).  What surprised me was the lack of births in spring.  January through March are slightly below average (about -0.6 sigma (sigma is 1 standard deviation – that is, 1 sigma is the amount of change we will ordinarily see when looking at this data set), but July, August, and September are gangbusters at about +1.2 sigma!  December had a short spike, too.  Apparently it was too hot in the summer of 1977, and when the weather cooled off, people decided they needed to get together.  The hearsay wisdom that birthdays are clustered towards the spring (which might hold true in other years but certainly didn’t hold true in USA 1978) is based on the notion that mothers prefer to carry their babies to term in the less-than-sweltering spring months, but the 1977-8 family planning doesn’t seem to have been so well coordinated.

That reminds me… we can assume (quite reasonably) with a population of several million people that “that time of month” will be uniformly distributed throughout the women.  Sociology likewise has a near-uniform distribution, but climatology does not, to be sure.  Snowstorms often precede a burst of births – but since snowstorms are local events, the local hospital sees it, but the nation of millions doesn’t get much of a blip out of the event.  I hypothesized this morning that the births in 1978 summer-autumn were encouraged by the hot summer of 1977 (no, I didn’t look up the temperatures) and the ensuing passion when autumn 1977 came along.  Of course, other factors will cause dips and surges, but few are on a national scale.  I’m curious to know what happened to births in June 2002, for example.

CRAZY!       Nth Degree  Posted 16 February 2006 at 12:37 pm      It’s super simple.  If you have a deck of cards with 365 unique cards in it and you start to flip over cards one at a time, you aren’t looking for a match to one specific card, so each card turned over adds a whole new possibility to match to.  With each card turned over you have more and more possible targets.  Remember, you’re looking for any two random matches, you’re not looking to match one single card out of the 365.  It’s simple.       Nth Degree  Posted 16 February 2006 at 12:42 pm      Another way to put it is this; What you are thinking about in the situation you are presenting really is asking what are the chances that a group of people will match YOUR birthday.  Those chances are 1 in 365.  By adding more people you are adding more possible birthdays that any 2 people can match.  See what I’m saying?       indra c  Posted 17 February 2006 at 05:27 am      Nth Degree you have once again proven my theory :  [math –> simplicity = indra c.–> utter confusion]  Or in lay terms:   The more math is simplified, the more i get confused.  And the “you see? It’s really simple” by god that just puts me out of my sane self.  I will now go bite a wall face-on and curse you mathematicians!  Have you ever tried biting a wall face-on?  Well there you have it, that’s just about the same relationship i have with the simplicity of mathematics.  When I think back to my math teacher who pulled off the “you see? it’s really simple” countless times, i feel really really sorry for him to have had me as a student.  No Harvard degree will ever prepare you for the complexities (or not) of a brain that’s on strike.  On the flip side i do understand the theories and paradoxes of quantum physics as long as none of it is “simplified” by numbers (of course).  That would really be evil.  If you really want to insult me, put candles on my birthday cake and ask me to count them.

What is the probability of that occuring?       c_s_1987  Posted 25 March 2006 at 07:37 am      It’s probably a good idea to think about everyone whose birthday you know  (family, friends etc,  you can include celebrities if you wish).  There are probably around 300 people I know whose birthdays I have heard at some point (not including celebrities in this case), yet at least 5 of these were born on October 2.  I also know 2 people from those 300 or so who share my birthday (October 24),  although this is obviously influenced by the fact that I am more likely to hear and remember people’s birthdays when they are the same as mine.       c_s_1987  Posted 25 March 2006 at 07:41 am      lahuard said: “In my school of 3500 students, I am the only one with the birthday of March 14. What is the probability of that occuring?”  Probably higher than you think (don’t know how to work it out exactly though). In a school of that size, it is very likely that no one has their birthday on a particular day, let alone one person. Admittedly the probability is much lower when considering only one person.       The_Smurf_Strangler  Posted 06 April 2006 at 02:17 pm      Just so I feel included I’m Jan. 9 ….I know no one cares. But my sister is feb. 27       Juelstar  Posted 06 April 2006 at 08:56 pm      My birthday is Feb 22 also. So cool.       crazythingshappen  Posted 10 April 2006 at 02:57 am      I have read all the posting (well the ones i could understand some just went way over my head).   I would like to know the likely hood of 2 ppl sharing the exact same birthday 11-03-81, but before finding that out had known each other for most of their lives.  We never saw each other outside of events at a certain Uncles place, so we never knew the fact about our birthdays until the year we turned 19.       althos17  Posted 11 April 2006 at 10:14 am      I was siiting in the waiting room at the Dr.’s office waiting for an appointment for my son. There were a total of nine people in the waiting room. There were two women with infants, so my wife being curious, asked them how old their children were. The children were both six months old and one of the mothers said that their child’s birthday was May 24. The other said that it was amazing, her child was born on the same day. My son who was five years old was also born on the same date, May 24! It gets even stranger… The father of the fourth child says that he can’t believe it but his birthday was also May 24!! So we all got out our ID’s and proved the coincidence. It was very amazing in the fact that four of the nine people had exactly the same birthdate.       BTrey  Posted 15 June 2006 at 12:38 pm      Joe:  With two people, the odds are that high because of all the different combination.  If you made a table of them, it would go like this: Person 1     Person 2 Jan 1            Jan 1 Jan 1            Jan 2 ….                  (362 more lines) Jan 1            Dec 31 Jan 2           Jan 1 ….                 (363 more lines) Jan 2           Dec 31 You would end up having 365 * 365 lines in your table. As for the late February “coincidence,” how many people do you think have read this page?  Probably thousands.  Most people saw a birthday that wasn’t near their own, and didn’t bother to respond.  A few people saw a birthday that was near their own and thought “Wow!  That’s neat!  I’ll type a response about this amazing coincidence!” Finally, my own birthday coincidence story:  My name is Dan, and my birthday is August 30th.  My first wife’s birthday was August 31st.  My boss at the time was also named Dan.  His birthday was August 31st.  His wife’s birthday was August 30th.  When this came out, he didn’t believe me until he’d seen both our IDs.

I bet it dips because the events of September 11, 2001  gave people pause and knocked romance from the air for awhile.”  I would think it would be the opposite. I know a lot of people that increased their mating patterns shortly after that day – myself and wife included. In times of severe tragedy, humans have a tendency to grope for any form of solice they can find. For those couples of viable breeding capability, with feelings of “I’m at a loss for what to do… just hold me”, the situation was ripe for lovin’. I’d suspect June 2002 had a slightly higher than typical birth rate (in the USA at least).

Everyone knows that a coin flip is 50/50, and so the chance that you will have 2 flips the same is 50% (HH,HT,TH,TT – 2 times out of 4). Now consider a biased “coin flip”. Roll 1 dice, and look at the result as either “6” or “not 6”. If you roll 2 dice this way, the chance that they will both give you the same result is around 72% (26/36 if you want to be exact). You can extend this by doing “1,2” “3,4” “5,6” (12/36) then “1,2,3” “4,5” “6” (14/36) and “1,2,3,4” “5” “6” (18/36). You could go even further if you have bigger dice.. but I think that proves my point.  If you want to do an experiment based on this paradox, tell people abbout this paradox, and then ask them how many 20-sided dice they would need to roll so that a pair comes up at least half the time, and then count the number of people that say less than 6… (And you can include me in that, because I guessed 5)  Oh, and for those that care, August 27th       jandra52  Posted 15 September 2006 at 03:10 pm      Emmy says:  Daniel Lew said: “I got a dose of this in a mathematics class once.

Now math tackles all non-living matter. Einsteins theory of relativity makes much sense. You can predict anything that will happen by knowing everything happening now because you use logic. But when it comes to people, logic entirely fails. Math is entirely based on logic. So math fails too. I don’t know what retard scientists (if any) try to prove this probability thing with math, but they must be out of their minds. There are no set patterns in people. Patterns will never be constant as long as living things alter them. I don’t understand why everybody is getting so hooked on this. Probability DOES NOT APPLY TO PEOPLE. It is like asking “What is the probability that someone will pick tihs over this?” What is the probability a couple will pick this night to have sex compared to this? You don’t know the likes dislikes, if they like warm or cold weather, how their day went, so on and so forth. If you did you could predict. But this is a GLOBAL scale. No computer could handle this.  By the way. Those February birthdays are all together because people in February saw that someone else was born then adn wanted to put that because it was close. And consider the fact that this was posted in February. If it was posted in October, someone will have said that their birthday is coming up, and someone else will say “Mine too!” and that will snowball until everyone starts posting their birthdays and it will be shown that there is a wide diversity of birthdays.

But if you look at the year you are born and then the year your father is born (or mother).  When you reach their year in age (for example if they were born in 1933, then when you reach 33), they will be the year you were born.  I thought this was kind of cool.  I think it breaks somewhere, but I think it holds true for all those up to 1999.  Try it.  Carlos  (Of course if you were adopted or otherwise not born of your parents then this wouldn’t work).”  Carlos you are an idiot. There is nothing special about that.  E.G. : I’m born 1991. My parents are born in 1958. When I was born, they were 33. That means that 33 years passed from 1958 to 1991. So 58 + 33=91. Now when you already have 33 (parents age when you are born) and you just add 58 (the years it takes for you to reach their number) you get 33+58 which is also 91.  Nothing special. Nothing complicated. Simple math. Think.       vaulter  Posted 16 October 2006 at 03:24 am      Dear Didoka,  If you are as smart as your snide comments seem to suggest, you would obviously know that when math is applied to people we call it something different. We call it statistics.  You are right, math does not really apply to people. There are exceptions, such as the “Magic Ratio” that stems from the Fibonacci Sequence, but we’re talking about numbers, not geometry, so I’ll leave that one alone.  But you are completely wrong if you think probability does not apply to people. Every company in the world that has ever advertised has used statistics and probability to solve the question of “what is the probability that someone will pick this over this” in order to make their ad campaigns as effective as possible. And these companies are able to predict which methods of advertising will be most effective for any given demographic, despite only knowing a small portion of data (called a sample) from the population of interest.  Statistics was created specifically to simplify the analysis of data, because it just isn’t worth trying to make predictions by looking specifically at every piece of data. It’s already been mentioned that births will be higher on Monday and Tuesday because hospitals don’t want to deliver babies on the weekend (doc’s gotta get his golf in). For you to say we still can’t predict when most births will occur makes you look like the idiot, not anyone else on this page. And this is only one of an almost infinite number of situations that can be examined for patterns. I’m guessing you PROBABLY don’t want to risk making yourself look like an idiot again by questioning every one of those situations.  I am sorry this thread was so far below your level of intellect that you had to force your negative attitude upon the rest of us, but in reality your failure to recognize that people are indeed interested in probability and that it indeed is a very useful thing to know about if you want to really be successful in this world shows everyone reading this that you really don’t know what the hell you are talking about. Rather than embracing this thread as an interesting sociological experiment, if nothing else, and learning how to effectively interact with people whose minds operate in a different way than your own, you feel the need to project your insecurities on the people here who are simply enjoying learning about an unintuitive phenomenon.  Basically, what I’m trying to say is that you are clearly a loser, with a stupid user name and a bad attitude, and you probably haven’t gotten laid in a long time. Which is ironic both because of the discussion of sex that has already come up, and also because the stupidest person posting on here has most likely gotten more ass to date than you will in your entire life. Sucks to be you.  Sincerely, Dave       PhilD  Posted 13 December 2006 at 06:38 am      lahuard said: “In my school of 3500 students, I am the only one with the birthday of March 14. What is the probability of that occuring?”  Well, that depends on your exact question. What are the odds that in a school of 3500 people, someone has their own birthday by themselves (ie, no others share the birthday? For this, the probability is extremely high (I have no exact numbers, but another classical math. fact, the “coupon collector [problem]”, says that, with only 3500 people, it’s actually very likely that there are still some days where nobody was born).  If the question is more like, “what are the odds that among 3499 other people, none were born the same day [of the year] as I was?”, then, assuming equal distribution of birthdays, the probability can be expressed as (364/365)^3499, which is pretty low (0.0067%), roughly one in 14000.  Now, many of these apparent coincidences (“hey, we’re talking about the odds of something unlikely happening, and look, here’s a very unlikely coincidence!”) can be “explained” in two ways at least: first, if you look hard enough for coincidences, you will find some (“Hey, my name is Philippe, and my girlfriend’s name is Marie-Line – out of all the possible names, what were the odds?”); and second, people will tend to come forward with “weird” stories much more easily than those with nothing “weird” to tell (which can also explain the sequence of February birthdays: once someone came forward with their own February birthday, anyone with a close birthday also came forward, while those with June or January just didn’t intervene).       notthattartagain  Posted 06 January 2007 at 12:24 pm      I’ve noticed the skew towards fall birthdays within my family. There are seven of us. I – second oldest – was born March 16th. My older sister was April 25th. Everyone else falls between September 5th and November 6th. (9/5, 10/3, 10/23, 11/4, 11/6).  Not a summer or winter birthday among us. That’s what I call skewed.       jimgraves  Posted 17 January 2007 at 12:58 pm      Honestly, the math started to leave me behind.  I don’t see the whole thing as so unintuitive once you think about it. Let’s say you go to a party and there are a bunch of people there.  You ask the first person what their birthday is. Its not yours. Not strange. You go on to the second person and so forth.  it wouldn’t freak me out if the first twenty people were duds. If I hadn’t found a match by  person twenty or so, it would start getting kind of weird because life isn’t that pefectly random. It would seem odd to me that after asking forty people I should have no matches.  Not impossible but odd. Its like lottery numbers.  Intuitively you’d think that since the numbers are chosen at random you should spread out your number choices(2,14,27,34,48,59) but in real life the numbers aren’t that “random”.  You get stuff more like 2,4,7,15,18,42,49.  For fun take  a lottery ticket and fill out the winning numbers and look at the little visual patterns.       jimgraves  Posted 17 January 2007 at 01:02 pm      minor correction  “If i hadn’t found a match by person forty or so it would start getting weird. ”  The thing is I run into weird coincidences all the time, as i’m sure most do, but like I said, its because life isn’t perfectly random.       t-mack  Posted 19 February 2007 at 01:01 pm      Can this same theory be applied to something a bit more useful, like say, the lottery. If chances of winning are 1 in 55 million, do I need to buy 55 million tickets to be 100% sure of winning? Or do I have a 99.7% chance of winning with something significantly less, like 8 million tickets? Anyone?       ShlomoAm  Posted 31 May 2007 at 03:16 am      Hello.  How are the numbers in the second colum (# of these combinations where at least two people have the same birthday) computed ?       Mark C  Posted 18 August 2007 at 10:43 pm      *** It would seem odd to me that after asking forty people I should have no matches. Not impossible but odd. ***  Wow, you have an amazingly poor grasp of the problem, and probability generally.  If you ask 40 people you will still almost certainly not have a match (odds just over 10%).  You would in fact have to ask 253 people to have a 50% chance at even one match of your birthday.  The (to some people) surprisingly high odds of a match with 23 people come not because any one person has much of a chance of a match (they don’t) but because there are 23 people who could have a match.  If I were you I’d stay away from Vegas.

You’re somehow confusing RANDOM with EVENLY SPREAD OUT.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Odds are some clustering will occur, because there are more combinations with some numbers clustered than combinations without.  It has nothing to do with “real life” not being “that random.”  It has to do with you having no idea what randomness really means.

How many friends must you have in order to have a 99% chance of at least one present every day ? I don’t know and wouldn’t even attempt the math but I’d guess you need a very large phone book (NY City size at least) to keep track of all those friends.

Nothing to see here  Posted 25 October 2008 at 11:20 am      Odd coincidence: While in high school in Nebaraska (important later) one of my best friends had the same birthday as me, but two years difference. Fun coincidence. Fast forward to after graduating and getting a job. One of my coworkers had the same birthday. Funny coincidence. Then it turns out that we were not only born on the very same day (same age), but at the very same hospital. The odds of that aren’t necessarily high.

The probability of duplication is a whole lot more important when applied to real-life situations. For example, what is the probability of two DNA sequences to be identical, when N persons are considered?  There is now software to calculate a wide variety of duplication cases or collisions, including the Birthday Paradox.

Elemel  Posted 21 February 2011 at 12:05 pm      I came across this site today on 21st Feb.  It seems that (sourced soley from this article) a lot of people with birthdays in February are into maths – did you know that Einstein was born on 22nd Feb (so was I incidentally) – so what about the probability of a link between maths geniuses and people born in February?  ;)       palmski  Posted 25 March 2011 at 05:36 am      My birthdays 24th Feb too … rubbish with maths but there seems to be alot of Feb birthdays in here. Which begs the question .. what are the percentages of a person being a Pisces more likely to look into something like this?       Alisher  Posted 06 January 2012 at 02:09 am      If n people are present in a room, what is the probability that no two of them celebrate their birthday on the same day of the year? How large need n be so that this probability is less than ½?       Alisher  Posted 06 January 2012 at 02:12 am      An infinite sequence of independent trials is to be performed. Each trial results in a success with probability p and a failure with probability 1 – p. What is the probability that i) At least 1 success occurs in the first n trials; ii) Exactly k successes occur in the first n trials; iii) All trials result in successes? (5)  Q4. (a) The probability mass function of a random variable X is given by p(X = i) = cli i!, i = 0,1, 2,…, where l is some positive value. Find i) P (X = 0); ii) P (X > 2).       Alisher  Posted 06 January 2012 at 02:40 am      CO absorbs at 2.143 × 105 m-1 which is similar to the absorption of NO+ ion. Can yougive any reason for this similarity?       Husan  Posted 09 February 2013 at 09:02 pm      How do u get 290,299,465????       Polymath  Posted 06 February 2014 at 10:34 am      Calculating the probability that everyone’s birthdays are different is much easier: product( (365-n)/365 ) for n = 0 to group size -1. eg, for 23 you have: (364/365).(363/365).(362/365). […] .(344/365).(343/365) = 0.4927. 1 minus this value is the probability that at least 2 are shared = 0.5073  ie, in a group of 23 people, there is greater than 50% chance of 2 people sharing a birthday. Simple huh?       mitch  Posted 10 February 2015 at 11:11 am      Furnace, I am reading this article 9 years to the day that you posted your comment, and my birthday is on 24 February! Pretty cool!       Matthijs  Posted 13 May 2015 at 07:51 am      Great article, although the title is misleading. This is in no way a paradox, just a strange phenomenon.       name  Posted 04 July 2015 at 07:12 pm      My daughter and I share the same birthday down to the minute. My wife’s birthday is the 2 days before ours. My daughter was late compared to her due date (due date would have put her in the day BETWEEN my wife and me) I was premature by two months (yay crack baby) lol.       eternel  Posted 27 August 2015 at 01:39 am      I have married two times Both my wifes have exctly the same birthday 29 january 1975 One birth country Armenia the second South Africa i feel that iam unique in this world       geoff  Posted 15 October 2015 at 02:30 am      The matching Birthday with the parents Birthday pretty interesting I guess the famous beyonce is the late Joan Rivers daughter       steve  Posted 02 June 2016 at 09:50 pm      I wish to make a comment on birthday paradoxs What are the chances of 2 people having the same date month and year of birth and those 2 people being born 1 female in the northern hemisphere and the other Male in the southern hemisphere And those 2 people meeting quite by accident and starting a relationship ?       Akem  Posted 10 August 2016 at 06:31 am      My mother and father have 6 kids and we all was born on the 2nd or 16 of different months 3 of us are born on the 16 and 3 born on the 2nd!!!

Updated: July 15, 2015 I love having a shared birthday with my baby! I remember hearing others tell me that I would not like it and it would be hard to celebrate his birthday and my birthday at the same time and all that jazz. In reality, it has not bothered me once, in fact, I love it! Granted, I was pushing out a 7 pound and 6 ounce child out of me on my day but it was awesome. The grandest gift I could have ever gotten. What could ever top that present?! For a mama and a baby to have a shared birthday is like having a double birthday. Double the cake, double the celebration and double the love! It cannot get much sweeter then that. After I gave birth to Mister, two years ago today, I remember invisioning what my mom had gone through with me during milestones, monthly growth, and seasonal times with me as a baby. I was looking at my son and thinking that is how my mom looked at me during the same weeks and months of the year. It was a pretty trippy thought. Double birthdays have several advantages for mommy and child. If you are the type of mom who does not care for your birthday to be acknowledged, you have the perfect scapegoat. If you are the type of mom who enjoys reminding others or your child of your agonizing birth with your shared birthday baby, you can rub in their faces that you were in labor and pushing out a child on YOUR birthday while others eat cake on their birthdays. Always a good punch line. A really great advantage to having a double birthday is that your baby will NEVER forget your birthday, if they do, they better have forgotten their birthday as well! The neat thing about having a shared birthday is that when people call or give you a happy birthday message, they can hit two birds with one stone. I find it fun and kind of a priviledge if you will, that the same time Mister is given a happy birthday message then so am I and vice versa. It is quite cool to have a double birthday with my kid. I mean, how common is that? Not too common. Funny thing is, is that it is so interesting when one finds out that mother and child share a birthday and the same question always gets asked, "How does that feel, sharing a birthday with your kid?" Well, umm, pretty darn good actually. Mister and I have never actually had a double birthday party. That would be weird. I am not a kid anymore and I would rather my sweetie have his day. As a matter of fact, when I think of our birthday, I really only think of him, and that it is his birthday and not mine. I suppose that happens when you become a mama. I never minded. However, for my own mom, she thinks of it as my birthday. After all, it has been nearly three decades since that day became mine and only two years since Mister shared that day with his mama. Not that she does not remember Mister's birthday, because she absolutely does but, her first thought is me, her baby. I am her daughter and that probably has everything to do with it, just like I mainly think of Mister having that day reserved for only him. Having a double birthday with my boy is pretty awesome. I get to say it all of the time during mommy conversation and every year on our birthdays. Babies are the best gifts and I just happened to get that best gift on the day of my birth!
