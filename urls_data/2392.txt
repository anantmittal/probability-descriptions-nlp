There are almost as many ways of choosing lottery numbers as there are chances of winning it.  With a must-win £24.7 million jackpot up for grabs this week , picking the right numbers could change your life.  However, the first thing to realise is that the odds are stacked against you.  The chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 (or approximately 1 in 14 million), while there is a 1 in 2,330,636 chance of getting five numbers plus the bonus ball.  There is a one in 55,000 chance of five of your numbers being selected by the lottery machine.  To win the Euromillions jackpot there is a one in 116.5 million of all your numbers being drawn.       Changes to the National Lottery        T he chance winning any of the lottery prizes, however small,  is approximately 54 to 1. So an average of one million people per draw will likely win a prize.  But is there a way of narrowing these odds? Let's take a look at some of the options:  Picking the most commonly drawn numbers  One approach would be to choose the numbers that come up most often. At the moment the most frequently drawn ball is the number 44 .  Since the National Lottery began in 1994, it has been drawn 253 times.  The other most common numbers are:   38 – 251 times  40 – 249 times  23 – 248 times  39 – 246 times  33 – 245 times   However, their frequency of appearance is no indication that they will be drawn together. In fact, the chance of these numbers cropping up in a winning combination is the same as any other set of six.           1. Choosing the birthdays of family or friends  F or those who use birthdays, five of the most commonly drawn numbers are more than 31, meaning they are not likely to have picked them.  Sticking to birthdays certainly limits the range of numbers you can choose and this is a common system, so more people are likely to pick those numbers, meaning you may have to share your prize.                 And the winner is...   Credit: PA          2. Picking overdue numbers  A nother approach that is commonly used is to look for numbers that have not come up in a while.  Human intuition tells us that if something has not happened in a while, then it is probably overdue.  Currently the most overdue number is 48 – it has not been picked in nearly 81 days. Similarly, the numbers 23 and 46 last appeared 77 days ago.  The 21 ball came up 63 days ago while number 14 was selected 60 days ago and number 2 emerged 56 days ago.  The least picked numbers are 20, 13, 21, 41, 16, and 37.  However, while the concept that things which are overdue will eventually happen makes sense, it does not mean they will when it comes to the National Lottery .                 In it to win it   Credit: Paul Grover          D r John Haigh, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Sussex who has written a paper on the statistics underlying the National Lottery, said: “Just because a number has not come up for a while does not mean it will in the next draw.  “Just as you flip a coin, if you get five heads in a row, it does not mean the next time it is more likely to be tails. The odds are still 50/50.           “So with the lottery, they remain one in 14 million.”  3. Lucky numbers  L ike birthdays, this is a common approach, steeped more in superstition than any real logic. But some people are naturally drawn to certain numbers in the same way they may have a favourite colour.  Interestingly the most commonly chosen numbers are those that end in a 7 according to work done by experimental physicist Jonathan Clarke .  The key here is having enough lucky numbers to fill an entire lottery ticket – if you have to borrow numbers from someone else then they are not really lucky any more are they?  And if you win, are you going to share the jackpot with them?  4. Picking previous winning numbers  Analysis of the Swiss lottery revealed has revealed a surprising trend – people tend to choose their numbers based on the previous week’s winning numbers.  Others were found to use the jackpot numbers from two weeks before and some further back than that.  Does this make any difference? Sadly, Dr Haigh tells us the odds remain the same. But it does make picking the numbers easier.  5. Pick the best-ever performing ticket  If you had selected the ticket 03 06 13 23 27 49 in every draw since the National Lottery started you would have won £2,017,671 according to analyst Richard Lloyd .  He has found that this ticket has been the best performing in the history of the lottery so far in terms of the number of prize winning matches.           H owever, the odds of that combination coming up again remain the same.  6. The appliance of science  There is a multitude of reading material giving advice about how win the lottery.  For upwards of £20 of your hard -earned money, you too can learn how to use complicated maths or systems like wheeling to pick your numbers.  Wheeling, which is one of the most popular systems, involves buying multiple tickets and using seven numbers rather six across those, for example.  Prediction software is also widely available on the internet with accompanying claims of great accuracy.  In fact, none of these have ever been proven to be effective and experts say those that with enough people using these systems, simple statistics says some people will win using them.  Indeed, perhaps the only people who really win from these approaches are the people who pocket the cash being paid for the books in the first place.  7. The random selection  Surprisingly, this is seen as the best approach by experts.  Not because it increases your chance of winning, but because it increases your chance of winning MORE.  By selecting numbers that use systems employed by others, it is more likely that other people will also have picked those numbers too.  If your numbers were to win the jackpot, then you would have to share more of your prize with those other people.  Randomly plucking numbers means the combination is least likely to have been selected by someone else.  “If you pick the least popular numbers and win, then you will probably share your jackpot with fewer people,” explains Dr Haigh.           8. Try the aesthetic approach  I n the ninth ever draw of the National Lottery in 1995, there were a record breaking 133 winners who shared the £16 million jackpot.  Analysis of the numbers revealed an interesting phenomenon – all of the numbers were contained within the three inside columns of the playing slip at the time.  There were also no two numbers on the same row nor adjacent to each other. It appears the numbers were selected randomly for the way they looked on the slip.  Dr Haigh says: “This is a really lazy way of choosing numbers as it is an easy thing to do.  “People do like to make pretty patterns on their playing slip.  “Research on the Swiss lottery has also shown that a lot of people select numbers that go diagonally across or down the slip, for example.”  However, Dr Haigh has some final words of wisdom that may help you decide which of these methods to use.  He says: “Whatever method you chose, the chances of your six numbers coming up remain the same. It is ridiculous to think otherwise.”  But remember, if any of these tips actually do result in a jackpot win, I’m more than happy to share some of the prize.

After increasing the number of balls from 49 to 59 in October, the National Lottery organisers reduced the odds on anyone’s six numbers coming up from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 45 million.

If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .  This gives the following results:    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    0          (    6  0    )        (    43  6    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 0}{43 \choose 6} \over {49 \choose 6}}    435,461/998,844  0.436  2.2938    1          (    6  1    )        (    43  5    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 1}{43 \choose 5} \over {49 \choose 6}}    68,757/166,474  0.413  2.4212    2          (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4} \over {49 \choose 6}}    44,075/332,948  0.132  7.5541    3          (    6  3    )        (    43  3    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 3}{43 \choose 3} \over {49 \choose 6}}    8,815/499,422  0.0177  56.66    4          (    6  4    )        (    43  2    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 4}{43 \choose 2} \over {49 \choose 6}}    645/665,896  0.000969  1,032.4    5          (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}    43/2,330,636  0.0000184  54,200.8    6          (    6  6    )        (    43  0    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 6}{43 \choose 0} \over {49 \choose 6}}    1/13,983,816  0.0000000715  13,983,816    When a bonus number is included, the adjusted odds are: [1]    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    5, bonus not won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )   1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000180208  55,491.33    5, bonus won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )    (  1  −  1  )     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose (1-1)} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000004291  2,330,636    Pick8-32 odds and calculations [ edit ]  The Pick8-32 Lottery game by Trillion Coins [2] implements a lotto game ticket where 8 numbers from 01 to 32 are selected in any order and can be repeated. The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

Contents    1  Choosing 6 from 49  2  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49  3  Pick8-32 odds and calculations  4  Powerballs And Bonus Balls  5  Minimum number of tickets for a match  6  References  7  External links     Choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  In a typical 6/49 game, each player chooses six non-duplicate numbers from a range of 1-49. If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .  This gives the following results:    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    0          (    6  0    )        (    43  6    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 0}{43 \choose 6} \over {49 \choose 6}}    435,461/998,844  0.436  2.2938    1          (    6  1    )        (    43  5    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 1}{43 \choose 5} \over {49 \choose 6}}    68,757/166,474  0.413  2.4212    2          (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4} \over {49 \choose 6}}    44,075/332,948  0.132  7.5541    3          (    6  3    )        (    43  3    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 3}{43 \choose 3} \over {49 \choose 6}}    8,815/499,422  0.0177  56.66    4          (    6  4    )        (    43  2    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 4}{43 \choose 2} \over {49 \choose 6}}    645/665,896  0.000969  1,032.4    5          (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}    43/2,330,636  0.0000184  54,200.8    6          (    6  6    )        (    43  0    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 6}{43 \choose 0} \over {49 \choose 6}}    1/13,983,816  0.0000000715  13,983,816    When a bonus number is included, the adjusted odds are: [1]    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    5, bonus not won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )   1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000180208  55,491.33    5, bonus won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )    (  1  −  1  )     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose (1-1)} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000004291  2,330,636    Pick8-32 odds and calculations [ edit ]  The Pick8-32 Lottery game by Trillion Coins [2] implements a lotto game ticket where 8 numbers from 01 to 32 are selected in any order and can be repeated. The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .

The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

In the 5-from-90 lotto, the minimum number of tickets that can guarantee a ticket with at least 2 matches is 100. [3]  References [ edit ]     ^  Zabrocki, Mike (2003-03-01).

Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !

For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   .

Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .

The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

In the 5-from-90 lotto, the minimum number of tickets that can guarantee a ticket with at least 2 matches is 100. [3]  References [ edit ]     ^  Zabrocki, Mike (2003-03-01).

If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .  This gives the following results:    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    0          (    6  0    )        (    43  6    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 0}{43 \choose 6} \over {49 \choose 6}}    435,461/998,844  0.436  2.2938    1          (    6  1    )        (    43  5    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 1}{43 \choose 5} \over {49 \choose 6}}    68,757/166,474  0.413  2.4212    2          (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4} \over {49 \choose 6}}    44,075/332,948  0.132  7.5541    3          (    6  3    )        (    43  3    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 3}{43 \choose 3} \over {49 \choose 6}}    8,815/499,422  0.0177  56.66    4          (    6  4    )        (    43  2    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 4}{43 \choose 2} \over {49 \choose 6}}    645/665,896  0.000969  1,032.4    5          (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}    43/2,330,636  0.0000184  54,200.8    6          (    6  6    )        (    43  0    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 6}{43 \choose 0} \over {49 \choose 6}}    1/13,983,816  0.0000000715  13,983,816    When a bonus number is included, the adjusted odds are: [1]    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    5, bonus not won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )   1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000180208  55,491.33    5, bonus won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )    (  1  −  1  )     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose (1-1)} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000004291  2,330,636    Pick8-32 odds and calculations [ edit ]  The Pick8-32 Lottery game by Trillion Coins [2] implements a lotto game ticket where 8 numbers from 01 to 32 are selected in any order and can be repeated. The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

In the 5-from-90 lotto, the minimum number of tickets that can guarantee a ticket with at least 2 matches is 100. [3]  References [ edit ]     ^  Zabrocki, Mike (2003-03-01).

If you do, DON  T PLAY THE LOTTERY. YOUR ODDS OF WINNING ARE AWFUL! This page will calculate your odds of winning. Here are some things to think about:  You have better chances of getting into a car accident, plane accident, or struck my lightning, than to win your lottery.  1/3 of people in the United States think winning the lottery is the only way to become financially secure in life.     How many correct numbers must you choose in order to win? (e.g. how many numbered balls or tokens are drawn for each lottery?)      What is the lowest number you can choose?    What is the highest number you can choose?         Note:
This calculation assumes that only one of each possible number will appear in the "winning numbers."  That is,
a given number, say 10, can only appear ONCE in the winning combination (most work this way).        Quick! I need help with:  Choose Math Help Item ...

As a mathematician, I have never purchased a lottery ticket. I find the odds depressing and have never had luck in winning anything from these kinds of games.  This hub is all about calculating lottery probability or odds. In order to make it more relevant to me, I decided to base it on the Grandlotto 6/55, the lottery game with the biggest prize money here in the Philippines. There will be two different cases discussed in the hub: the probability of winning the game with all six numbers matching, and the probability of having n numbers matching.   Rules of the Lottery Game It is always important to find out the rules of any game before participating in it. For the Grandlotto 6/55, in order to win the jackpot prize, you have to match six numbers from a pool of 55 numbers ranging from 1-55. The initial payout is a minimum of P20 (or around $0.47). It is also possible to win some money if you are able to match three, four, or five numbers of the winning combination. Note that the order of the winning combination here does not matter.  Here is a table for the prizes you can obtain:     No. of Matching Nos.   Prize Money (in Php)   Prize Money (in $)   6   minimum of 30 million   ~700,000   5   150,000   ~3,500   4   2,000   ~47   3   150   ~4      Some Probability Concepts Before we start with the calculations, I would like to talk about Permutations and Combinations . This is one of the basic concepts you learn in Probability Theory. The main difference being that permutations consider order to be important, while in combinations, order isn't important.  In a lottery ticket, permutation should be used if the numbers in your ticket have to match the order of the draw for the winning string of numbers. In the Grandlotto 6/55, order is not important because so long as you have the winning set of numbers, you can win the prize.  The next formulas only apply for numbers without repetition . This means that if the number x is drawn, it cannot be drawn again. If the number drawn from the set is returned before the next draw, then that has repetition.   This is the formula for Permutations, where order is important. | Source       This is the formula for Combinations, where order is not important. | Source   , where n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.  Note that based on the formulas given, C(n,k) is always less than or equal to P(n,k). You will see later on why it is important to make this distinction for calculating lottery odds or probability.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability for 6 Matching Numbers So now that we know the basic concepts of permutations and combinations, let us go back to the example of Grandlotto 6/55. For the game, n = 55, the total number of possible choices. k = 6, the number of choices we can make. Because order is not important, we will use the formula for combination:   Source   These are the odds or the total number of possible combinations for any 6-digit number to win the game. To find the probability, just divide 1 by the number above, and you will get: 0.0000000344 or 0.00000344%. See what I mean by depressing odds?  So what if we're talking about a different lottery game where order does matter. We will now use the permutation formula to get the following:   Source   Compare these two results and you will see that the odds for getting the winning combination where order matters has 3 additional zero's! It's going from about 28 million:1 odds to 20 billion:1 odds! The probability of winning for this case is 1 divided by the odds which equals to 0.0000000000479 or 0.00000000479%.  As you can see, because the permutation is always greater than or equal to the combination, the probability of winning a game where order matters is always less than or equal to the probability of winning a game where order does not matter. Because the risk is greater for games where order is required, this implies that the reward must also be higher.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability with Less Than 6 Matching Numbers Because you can also win prizes if you have less than 6 matching numbers, this section will show you how to calculate the probability if there are x matches to the winning set of numbers.  First, we need to find the number of way to choose x winning numbers from the set and multiply it by the number of ways to choose the losing numbers for the remaining 6-x numbers. Consider the number of ways to choose x winning numbers. Because there are only 6 possible winning numbers, in essence, we are only choosing x from a pool of 6. And so, because order does not matter, we get C(6, x).  Next, we consider the number of ways to choose the remaining 6-x balls from the pool of losing numbers. Because 6 are winning numbers, we have 55 - 6 = 49 balls to choose the losing numbers from. So, the number of possibilities for choosing a losing ball can be obtained from C(49, 6 - x). Again, order does not matter here.  So, in order to calculate the probability of winning with x matching numbers out of a possible 6, we need to divide the outcome from the previous two paragraphs by the total number of possibilities to win with all 6 matching numbers. We get:       Source   If we write this in a more general form, we get:   Source   , where n = total number of balls in the set, k = total number of balls in the winning combination for the jackpot prize, and x = total numbers of balls matching the winning set of numbers.  If we use this formula to calculate the probability (and the odds) of winning the Grandlotto 6/55 with only x matching numbers, we get the following:     x matches   Calculation   Probability   Odds (1/Probability)   0   C(6,0) * C(49,6)/C(55,6)   0.48237   2.07308   1   C(6,1) * C(49,5)/C(55,6)   0.39466   2.53777   2   C(6,2) * C(49,4)/C(55,6)   0.10963   9.12158   3   C(6,3) * C(49,3)/C(55,6)   0.01271   78.67367   4   C(6,4) * C(49,2)/C(55,6)   0.00060   1643.40561   5   C(6,5) * C(49,1)/C(55,6)   0.00001   98604.33673   6   C(6,6) * C(49,0)/C(55,6)   0.00000003   28989675      How to Choose the Winning Numbers in Lottery As you can see from the math in this hub, the probability of winning the lottery is the same for any 6-number combination available in the Grandlotto 6/55 game. This is also applicable for other lottery games out there.  As I was researching for this hub, I came across links that said never choose numbers that are sequential, like from 1-6 or some such nonsense. There is no such secret to winning the lottery! Each number is as equally likely to come up in the draw as the next number.  If you are willing to face the very little probability of winning the lottery, I say go choose any number you want. You can base it on your birthdays, special days, anniversaries, lucky numbers, etc. Just remember that with great risk comes great reward!

However there are also many factors(known and many unknown) which produces lottery results that happen to produce patterns, which may help in striking like few matching numbers but still ultra difficult in winning 6 matching numbers. It's still a combination of luck, for now i conclude it's combination of probability+luck (L.O.A or whatever u wanna call it)...cheers n good luck hehe  Author dezalyx 2 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Subs. From the definition of classical probability, every statistical outcome will contain elements that are equally likely to happen. This means that if you roll a 6-sided dice, it is equally probable that the outcome will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Or in the case of flipping a coin, the probability of heads will be equal to the probability of tails. No magic coins, no loaded dice, all equally probable to happen. When calculating the lottery probability in this article, this assumption is already used. This is usually the case when calculating probabilities theoretically. Having no affiliation to companies who hold the lottery, it would be difficult for me to assume that certain balls are more likely to surface because they are loaded. In my opinion, historical data does not have any bearing on lottery outcomes. Statistically speaking, working on other probability approaches will not work because of this. Just because the number N appears frequently in lottery drawings, does not mean that the ball is more likely to surface than the number N+1 in the next drawing.  Subs 2 months ago  Can the classical probability theory be used here? And please give an example  Subs 2 months ago  What other probability approaches can be used?  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Odds. Thanks for commenting. I did not say choosing one's birthday would contribute to one's luck. I just said you can choose any number you want if you're willing to face the fact that there's only a very small chance that you can win the jackpot prize. Heck, you could choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 if you wanted to. The basis of this article is that the probability of each ball getting drawn is the same as any other ball in the lottery. While I kept getting comments on how likely certain numbers will get picked over other numbers, mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as having weighted balls for lottery drawings. While you might not have studied mathematics, you certainly were on point when you said that you should never try your luck in gambling. That's actually a mathematician's saying. Never gamble, because the house always wins.  ODDS 7 months ago  I didn't study mathematics, but you were wrong when you mentioned that the numbers of the player's birthday would contribute to his luck, rather it would add up to the improbability, because certainly the player would not live enough to wait his birthday's numbers to come up! And yeah you certainly can top up your chances even if mathematically every number may pop up randomly. If i were to buy a ticket, i would consider not selecting numbers that are altogether evens/odds, divisible by 5 altogether etc. If the order does not matter, you will get more chances! But you know what, never try your luck in gambling, it's made to steal your money and you end up depressed.  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, jazer. I've been receiving a ton of comments lately asking for what the winning number will be for the next lottery draw, but the article is just about the probability of winning the lottery. I don't know about the specifics of the composition of lotto balls, since it probably differs for every company that makes them, but looking for trends when there is no factual basis will just result in you losing money. And given the odds of winning the lottery, you would be better off investing that money in something else with a higher chance of getting a profit. While I agree with the idea that maybe the composition of the balls would get it drawn more than the others, you can never bank on that, since it could be changed without you ever knowing about it (repainting the balls numbers, changing the balls entirely, having different sets of balls for different drawings, etc.).      jazer 8 months ago  Probability is probability. We cannot predict the future. But for the purpose of conversation, some people used they called a "trend". A history of past result. From trend you may "guess" which number can be with higher probability. Is this true in nature? Actually, this is only my opinion. My reasoning with the trend is somewhat related to the composition of the lotto balls e.g. weight, etc, that's why some numbers were drawn more that the others. What is your opinion on this? Thanks.  Kgomotso Comfort 9 months ago  I just want know how can I calculate the probabilities of 6/49  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Edgard, it seems to me that your question is still about the gambler's fallacy. Just because a certain number comes out approximately 6 times out of x number of drawings will not change the probability of the number being drawn again in the future. Imagine changing the game into a simple heads or tails coin flip. The probability of getting either outcome is 1/2. Just because you get 6 heads in a row does not mean the next result would be a tail. Even if you get 100 heads in a row, the probability of getting either outcome is still going to be 1/2. There won't be any probability equations to predict what you are looking for. If there is, the people who have discovered such equations would already be taking advantage of the lottery system. The only thing you can do with the study is plot historical graphs on how many times a certain number has come out previously and marvel at how some numbers seem to appear more than others.  Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalix, We really appreciate your time and answers We are aware that there will always be an average for any set of numbers, also we can find a trend to explain any series of numbers, but these work outs are not a guaranty that we will get really meaningful results. Our previous questions came out from the following fact: We made a sequential review of winning numbers of 260 draws of a 6/45 lottery, to find out the number of times (frequency) that each of the 45 balls was drawn; we started with a 160 draws sample, and increased the sample with 10 draws data each time, until we got the last sample of 260 draws; with every sample of draws, we worked out the rate = [total draws of the sample / frequency of each ball in the sample] for every ball, then we worked out the average of this 45 ratios; the result clearly showed a steady trend for this average, which started at 6.63, for the 160 draws sample, to 6.55 for the 260 draws sample; of course we could work with more sample, but we just decided to stop at 260 draws sample. We initially thought this ratio means the average number of draws we expect to wait for a ball to be drawn; but, what would be the right mining of this average (6.55), if any?, why the average has a steady trend?, and is there any probability equation to predict this average? ratio ni = [N° draws/Freq ni] i = [1, 45] Samples	       Average N° Draws	of ratios      Min ratio  Max ratio 260	                6.55	      4.73            8.97 250	                6.56	      4.63	          8.93 240	                6.57	      4.44	          8.57 230	                6.59	      4.26	          8.85 220	                6.58	      4.31	          8.46 210	                6.59	      4.29	          9.13 200	                6.61	      4.17	          9.09 190	                6.61	      4.13	          8.64 180	                6.62	      3.91	          9.00 170	                6.62	      3.95	          8.95 160	                6.63	      3.81	          8.89 Regards Edgard  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines No. The law of large numbers indicate that given a large number of opportunities, we should expect a certain event to happen again, no matter how unlikely it may be. For example, a set of 6 lottery numbers can get picked 2 weeks in a row. But, just because it happened, doesn't mean you should go running to buy the same exact set of numbers in the hopes of getting lucky. Each lottery picking is still independent of each other. So the probability of picking the correct set of numbers will remain the same for each drawing. Saying that one number has the chance to be drawn every specific number of games is succumbing to gambler's fallacy (mistaken belief that just because something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future). Odds represent the ratio that allow you to calculate how much money you will win on your bet in comparison to your stake. So your $10 ticket can become $23.67 if one number gets drawn. That is why you will notice that the odds keep increasing as you get more matches, meaning you get more money the more matches you get. I hope this answers your question, Edgard.      Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalyx, Thanks again, Regarding the same game 6/45: As the probability of one match is  0.42417, then Odds (1/Probability) will be 2.3678. According to probability theory and the law of large numbers, is it right to say, at least theoretically, that every 2.3678 games we should expect one match; in other words, one number has the chance to be drawn every 2.3678 games?  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Edgar. Just replace the numbers in the formula (from 55 to 45, 49 to 39) then solve for the answer to your question. [0.4241]  Edgard 11 months ago  ¿What would be the probability of one single ball to be part of the winner combination in a game where we have to pick a 6 number combination out of 45 numbers?. Thanks in advance for your answer!  Steve Ho Ong 2 years ago  from Dumaguete City This article is very clear because it is a step by step procedure.

Photo: Martin Barraud/Getty Images     By  Kimberly Amadeo    Updated November 07, 2017   The biggest lottery jackpot ever was $1.6 billion on January 13, 2016. Authorities announced three winning Powerball tickets in California, Tennessee, and Florida. That beats the Mega Millions on March 31, 2012. Three winners split a $656 million jackpot. The winning tickets were sold in Illinois, Maryland, and Kansas. Those states don't have to reveal the names of the winners. The prior largest Powerball payout was close behind, at $590.5 million.         Gloria C. Mackenzie, an 84-year old Floridian, won on June 5, 2013. The odds of winning either the Powerball or Mega Millions were roughly the same: 175 million to one . Despite those odds, one-third of Americans believe that winning the lottery is the only way they will ever retire. But how likely is it? Here's a humorous look comparing the odds of winning the lottery to some other lucky and unlucky events. That's followed by strategies that are more likely to win you a bountiful retirement . Things That Are More Likely Than Winning the Lottery If you believe in the odds of winning the lottery, then you should never fly or drive. That because you are more apt to be killed in a plane crash, where the odds are 25 million to one, and far more likely to die in a car accident, where the odds are only 5,000 to one. Similarly, you should start sleeping on the floor and taking showers. That's because the odds of being killed by falling out of bed are 2 million to one, while the odds of drowning while taking a bath are 840,000 to one.   But don't think you can improve your chances by avoiding cleanliness altogether. The odds of dying from a flesh-eating bacteria are only 1 million to one. Maybe you'll have better luck outside. Not! The odds of being killed by lightning are 2 million to one while being mauled to death by a dog are 700,000 to one.         Bring your anti-venom kit, because you are even more likely to die from a snake bite or bee sting, where the odds are 100,000 to one. If these statistics have you feeling a little paranoid, cheer up. Many good things are also more likely than winning the lottery. For example, the odds of becoming a movie star are only 1.5 million to one, while the odds of getting a royal flush in the first hand of poker are just 649,740 to one. Even better (guys), the odds of dating a supermodel are a measly 88,000 to one. To put it all into perspective, consider this. Scientists have calculated that there is just a 300 to one chance that asteroid 2004 MN4 will strike the Earth on April 13, 2029. The asteroid is about a quarter mile (400 meters) wide. That is larger than the asteroid that carved out Meteor Crater in Arizona, and the one that flattened thousands of square miles of forest in Siberia in 1908. Things You No Longer Have to Worry About OK, time for a little cheering up again. Many bad things are less likely than winning the lottery. For example, it's safe to go back into the water. The odds of dying from a shark attack are 300 million to one, only half as likely as winning the lottery. Swimming with the sharks is much safer than petting a dog, driving your car, or sleeping in your bed.          How to Improve Your Odds If you've read all these statistics, and still want to play the lottery, here are some ways to improve your chances. First, use the computer-generated numbers, they tend to be the luckiest. That's because there is less chance of someone else picking a duplicate number. Furthermore, only 30 percent of the winning numbers were the players' "lucky" numbers. Whatever you do, don't pick "lucky" seven, 11, or a birthday. You can be sure that someone else will have also picked those numbers. Second, be sure to play the $1 million or $2 million second prize in the Powerball. There, you only have to match five of the six numbers. Those odds are one out of 5 million. You get even better odds if you just play in the state lotteries instead of the national one. How to Improve Your Chances of Attaining Retirement Perhaps you are one of those who consider the lottery their best chance of retiring.  Well, consider this comparison instead. Let's say you currently buy a $2 lottery ticket every week for the next 17 years (before the 300 to one chance the asteroid hits Earth). There is little likelihood, based on the odds, that you would have won. If you instead invested that $2 a week in securities and got a 5 percent return, you would have accumulated $2,926. Doesn't sound like much, does it? Let's say you invested $2 a day instead. You would wind up with $20,5361 by 2029. Your return will probably be greater than that. Before the 2008 financial crisis , the average stock market return was 10 percent a year. If you get that return over the next 17 years, then your $2 a day would become $33,287. True, that's not enough to retire on. But what if you increased it to $5 a day. You'd wind up with $83,220. Or doubled that, and invested $10 a day, you'd get $166,436. Now you're talking. The point is that you do have better odds for a successful retirement if you plan for it than by playing the lottery. You don't have to depend on fate, chance or luck. You can take matters into your own hands, starting today.

          Updated Dec 29, 2017 2:14 PM EST   'Tis the season to start dreaming: Prizes for the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries have climbed past $300 million , with drawings set for Friday and Saturday. But don't quit your day job just yet. The odds of winning one of the jackpots is roughly one in 259 million for Mega Millions and one in 292 million for Powerball. And the chances of winning both, for those of you thinking really big? Roughly one in 75 quadrillion -- that's 15 zeros -- according to data scientists at Allstate. To understand how unlikely those odds are, it's worth comparing them to the probability of other unlikely events. Americans are much more likely to get struck by lightning (odds of one in 13,500) or to die in a car accident (one in 645). While the old lottery campaign "You've got to be in it to win it" holds true, the real value in buying a ticket may simply be to enjoy the dream of winning.     The Powerball website announced Thursday that no winning tickets had been sold. The estimated top prize for the next drawing on Saturday night is $384 million, or a cash prize of $242.9 million. The estimated Mega Millions jackpot is $306 million (or a cash option of $191 million), with the next drawing set for Friday at 11 p.m. Eastern time. Tickets cost $2. Sales time cut-offs vary by state but are usually one to two hours before the drawing. The average American spends about $200 a year on lottery tickets , though residents of some states spend far more. According to a study by LendEDU, the average Massachusetts resident spends $735 annually on lottery tickets . Rhode Islanders plop down $514 a year. And if you live in Delaware or New York, you're likely spending about $400 a year, or $33 per month (see map below). The odds of winning "scratchers" -- those little instant winning tickets that you can buy for prices ranging from $1 to $50 -- are better, but it's still no way to get rich. LendEDU experimented with determining "a return on investment" with scratchers by buying $1,000 worth of tickets. The good news: The site won with 68 of the 314 tickets -- indicating that you have a near 22 percent chance of a positive return with lottery scratchers. And, in fact, a big win ($500) on a $20 ticket helped the lending site recover the bulk of its investment. The bad news: Like most players, LendEDU lost money in the end, recovering just $974 of its $1,000. That amounts to an average return on investment of -2.6 percent. So who does make out in lottery sales? Convenience stores. Big jackpots tend to bring customers into gas stations and convenience stores, said Jeff Lenard, vice president of strategic industry initiatives at the National Association of Convenience Stores. Its members sell about two-thirds of all lottery tickets in the U.S. The giant Powerball and Mega Million jackpots are feeding on each other, with customers coming into stores to buy a ticket for one and noticing the other jackpot, he said.     "The key thing for awareness is really, once you go into the store to buy one, there's that screen that shows that there's another big jackpot," Lenard said. "It's that digital signage inside the store that's driving that double interest." Convenience stores make about a dime on a $2 ticket, or about 5 percent to 6 percent on each dollar spent. Winning stores also earn a commission, although the amount varies by state. Following are the odds of winning the jackpots, as calculated by Allstate, along with the chances of other unlikely events: Being a victim of identity theft by the age of 40 : 1 in 6 Getting bitten by a dog while out for a jog : 1 in 133 Getting a hole in one on your birthday : 1 in 25,000 Having all of the above happen to one person : 1 in 19,900,000 Winning Powerball: 1 in 292,201,338 Winning Mega Millions : 1 in 258,890,850 Winning both Powerball and Mega Millions : 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

Kevin Breuninger | @KevinWilliamB   Published  1:12  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018  Updated   1:42  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018  CNBC.com                show chapters               U.S. lottery players now have two chances at jackpots of more than $300 million   4:30  PM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  00:37       If your retirement plan involves winning either of this weekend's multi-million dollar lottery jackpots, sorry — you're far more likely to be killed by a falling asteroid.   The combined Powerball and the Mega Millions jackpots are the largest ever , at more than $1 billion. The Powerball jackpot is currently $570 million, and the Mega Millions stands at $450 million. Both games had their most recent jackpot wins in late October.  The next Mega Millions drawing is scheduled for 11 p.m. ET on Friday, and the next Powerball drawing is Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.   Two lottery drawings does technically imply more opportunities to win — but really, you should check your hopes at the convenience store counter.  The odds of winning the Powerball grand prize are 1 in 292.2 million, according to the game's own assessment . The Mega Millions jackpot odds are even more hopeless, at 1 in 302.5 million.  (In late October, Mega Millions changed its range of numbers players can choose from, which made the odds of winning the big jackpot slimmer. Before that change, its jackpot odds were 1 in 258.9 million.)  A few points of comparison. Your odds of being struck dead by a stray asteroid are just 1 in 1.9 million, according to Jim Murphy at sportsbettingexperts.com . The odds of being killed by a shark are even less likely at 1 in 3.7 million.       Getty Images   Yet both of these improbabilities are exponentially more likely than winning the whole bonanza in either of this weekend's lottery drawings.  And perish the thought of winning both the Mega Millions and the Powerball. An Allstate analysis from mid-2017 (before the Mega Millions top prize odds worsened) put the chance of a double-win at 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300. (That's 75 quadrillion.)  For those lucky few who do win the lottery, be prepared to sacrifice a hefty chunk of your winnings in tax payments almost immediately.  Lottery site USAMega.com estimates the federal tax withholding on the $281.2 million Mega Millions lump sum would be $70.3 million, and state taxes could knock out up to another $24.8 million (with New York the worst offender). For the Powerball, those tax tallies for the $358.5 million cash prize would be $89.6 million and up to $31.6 million, respectively.

Tweet This     on Saturday night, someone could win the largest Powerball lottery ever, $700 million    Every time you buy a quick pick, you get a different set of numbers; therefore, your odds are always going to be at their worst in that particular game,      I defy you to find anyone who has never fantasized about winning the lottery. The house! The travel! The help for loved ones and favorite charities! Someone to deliver a single, perfect piece of chocolate to your door every day! (OK, maybe that's just me.)  While most of us will never see that kind of money dumped in our laps, a select few lottery winners do actually get to realize their fantasy—and  on Saturday night, someone could win the largest Powerball lottery ever, $700 million .         Richard Lustig of Orlando, FL, has won seven lottery grand prizes through a system he developed.        One of the “luckiest” people in the nation is Richard Lustig, author of Learn How To Increase Your Chances of Winning the Lottery , who has won seven lottery grand prizes and perfected his strategy though trial and error. “When the lottery came to Florida, I was like everybody else: ‘Wow, buy lottery tickets, win a lot of money, retire, buy a big fancy yacht, whatever, blah, blah, blah,’” he said. “Like everybody else, I was running out and buying haphazardly, buying quick picks, I mean buying tickets with no plan, or no method, or whatever. Like everybody else, I was losing all the time.”  Then Lustig realized there had to be a way to increase his chances. Every time something worked, he’d write it down. Eventually, he had a “formula” that worked for him and others. His main tips--which don't all follow strict mathematical logic, and have been discounted by some as nonsense --for those playing lotteries are below:    Don’t use the “quick-pick” numbers generated from the store’s computer. Even though it seems like every number has an equal amount of “luck,” certain number sets are better than others. “  Every time you buy a quick pick, you get a different set of numbers; therefore, your odds are always going to be at their worst in that particular game, whatever game you're playing. In this case, the hype, of course, is all about the Powerball right now,” Lustig says.  Go beyond the birthdays. The spread is important—if you always choose birth month and dates, like most people do, you’re relegating yourself to less than half the numbers available, 1 through 31. Equally important about including bigger numbers: “If you pick your own numbers and only play birthdays and anniversaries, you’re splitting the pot with 20-40 people. If you spread the numbers out across the whole track, you’ll either be the only winner or will split it with only one or two people,” Lustig says.  Don’t change the numbers. Once you’ve determined which numbers are “good,” (he recommends a specific way to find these in his book) don’t switch them, play them every time. If you buy more than one card, use a different set of numbers. “Remember, a set of numbers wins the grand prize, not individual numbers,” Lustig says. He says it’s OK to repeat a number or two, but be sure each group of numbers is mostly different so you increase your odds. (Though, if you're looking at this in a solid math sense, in a fair lottery, every number has the same probability of being drawn.)  Play consistently. “Never miss a drawing in the game you’re playing. Every Saturday, every Wednesday, every week,” Lustig says.  Understand the odds, but know your limits : If you play 100 cards, you’ll have a better chance than if you pay just 10—but only play what you can afford to lose. It’s not a regular investment, as in an IRA or a stock. “One of the things that I preach to people all the time is budget, budget, budget,” Lustig says. “Set a budget of what you're going to spend. Do not get caught up in what's called lottery fever. Don't spend grocery money. Don't spend rent money. Figure out what you can afford to spend. Don't worry about how much Joe Blow down the street is spending. … Figure out what your budget is, what you can comfortably afford to spend, and stay within that budget."

Of course, plenty of financial professionals say it's never worth it to play the lottery. Even though there's a lot to be gained, in general, playing Powerball is still a bad decision because you never get the full jackpot, and chances are  you'll be splitting it, says Paul Dreyer, a mathematician for the RAND Corporation (who, for the record, fully disagrees with the logic of Lustig's method).

There are almost as many ways of choosing lottery numbers as there are chances of winning it.  With a must-win £24.7 million jackpot up for grabs this week , picking the right numbers could change your life.  However, the first thing to realise is that the odds are stacked against you.  The chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 (or approximately 1 in 14 million), while there is a 1 in 2,330,636 chance of getting five numbers plus the bonus ball.  There is a one in 55,000 chance of five of your numbers being selected by the lottery machine.  To win the Euromillions jackpot there is a one in 116.5 million of all your numbers being drawn.       Changes to the National Lottery        T he chance winning any of the lottery prizes, however small,  is approximately 54 to 1. So an average of one million people per draw will likely win a prize.  But is there a way of narrowing these odds? Let's take a look at some of the options:  Picking the most commonly drawn numbers  One approach would be to choose the numbers that come up most often. At the moment the most frequently drawn ball is the number 44 .  Since the National Lottery began in 1994, it has been drawn 253 times.  The other most common numbers are:   38 – 251 times  40 – 249 times  23 – 248 times  39 – 246 times  33 – 245 times   However, their frequency of appearance is no indication that they will be drawn together. In fact, the chance of these numbers cropping up in a winning combination is the same as any other set of six.           1. Choosing the birthdays of family or friends  F or those who use birthdays, five of the most commonly drawn numbers are more than 31, meaning they are not likely to have picked them.  Sticking to birthdays certainly limits the range of numbers you can choose and this is a common system, so more people are likely to pick those numbers, meaning you may have to share your prize.                 And the winner is...   Credit: PA          2. Picking overdue numbers  A nother approach that is commonly used is to look for numbers that have not come up in a while.  Human intuition tells us that if something has not happened in a while, then it is probably overdue.  Currently the most overdue number is 48 – it has not been picked in nearly 81 days. Similarly, the numbers 23 and 46 last appeared 77 days ago.  The 21 ball came up 63 days ago while number 14 was selected 60 days ago and number 2 emerged 56 days ago.  The least picked numbers are 20, 13, 21, 41, 16, and 37.  However, while the concept that things which are overdue will eventually happen makes sense, it does not mean they will when it comes to the National Lottery .                 In it to win it   Credit: Paul Grover          D r John Haigh, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Sussex who has written a paper on the statistics underlying the National Lottery, said: “Just because a number has not come up for a while does not mean it will in the next draw.  “Just as you flip a coin, if you get five heads in a row, it does not mean the next time it is more likely to be tails. The odds are still 50/50.           “So with the lottery, they remain one in 14 million.”  3. Lucky numbers  L ike birthdays, this is a common approach, steeped more in superstition than any real logic. But some people are naturally drawn to certain numbers in the same way they may have a favourite colour.  Interestingly the most commonly chosen numbers are those that end in a 7 according to work done by experimental physicist Jonathan Clarke .  The key here is having enough lucky numbers to fill an entire lottery ticket – if you have to borrow numbers from someone else then they are not really lucky any more are they?  And if you win, are you going to share the jackpot with them?  4. Picking previous winning numbers  Analysis of the Swiss lottery revealed has revealed a surprising trend – people tend to choose their numbers based on the previous week’s winning numbers.  Others were found to use the jackpot numbers from two weeks before and some further back than that.  Does this make any difference? Sadly, Dr Haigh tells us the odds remain the same. But it does make picking the numbers easier.  5. Pick the best-ever performing ticket  If you had selected the ticket 03 06 13 23 27 49 in every draw since the National Lottery started you would have won £2,017,671 according to analyst Richard Lloyd .  He has found that this ticket has been the best performing in the history of the lottery so far in terms of the number of prize winning matches.           H owever, the odds of that combination coming up again remain the same.  6. The appliance of science  There is a multitude of reading material giving advice about how win the lottery.  For upwards of £20 of your hard -earned money, you too can learn how to use complicated maths or systems like wheeling to pick your numbers.  Wheeling, which is one of the most popular systems, involves buying multiple tickets and using seven numbers rather six across those, for example.  Prediction software is also widely available on the internet with accompanying claims of great accuracy.  In fact, none of these have ever been proven to be effective and experts say those that with enough people using these systems, simple statistics says some people will win using them.  Indeed, perhaps the only people who really win from these approaches are the people who pocket the cash being paid for the books in the first place.  7. The random selection  Surprisingly, this is seen as the best approach by experts.  Not because it increases your chance of winning, but because it increases your chance of winning MORE.  By selecting numbers that use systems employed by others, it is more likely that other people will also have picked those numbers too.  If your numbers were to win the jackpot, then you would have to share more of your prize with those other people.  Randomly plucking numbers means the combination is least likely to have been selected by someone else.  “If you pick the least popular numbers and win, then you will probably share your jackpot with fewer people,” explains Dr Haigh.           8. Try the aesthetic approach  I n the ninth ever draw of the National Lottery in 1995, there were a record breaking 133 winners who shared the £16 million jackpot.  Analysis of the numbers revealed an interesting phenomenon – all of the numbers were contained within the three inside columns of the playing slip at the time.  There were also no two numbers on the same row nor adjacent to each other. It appears the numbers were selected randomly for the way they looked on the slip.  Dr Haigh says: “This is a really lazy way of choosing numbers as it is an easy thing to do.  “People do like to make pretty patterns on their playing slip.  “Research on the Swiss lottery has also shown that a lot of people select numbers that go diagonally across or down the slip, for example.”  However, Dr Haigh has some final words of wisdom that may help you decide which of these methods to use.  He says: “Whatever method you chose, the chances of your six numbers coming up remain the same. It is ridiculous to think otherwise.”  But remember, if any of these tips actually do result in a jackpot win, I’m more than happy to share some of the prize.

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (April 2011)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Lottery mathematics is used to calculate probabilities in a lottery game.     Contents    1  Choosing 6 from 49  2  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49  3  Pick8-32 odds and calculations  4  Powerballs And Bonus Balls  5  Minimum number of tickets for a match  6  References  7  External links     Choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  In a typical 6/49 game, each player chooses six non-duplicate numbers from a range of 1-49. If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .  This gives the following results:    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    0          (    6  0    )        (    43  6    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 0}{43 \choose 6} \over {49 \choose 6}}    435,461/998,844  0.436  2.2938    1          (    6  1    )        (    43  5    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 1}{43 \choose 5} \over {49 \choose 6}}    68,757/166,474  0.413  2.4212    2          (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4} \over {49 \choose 6}}    44,075/332,948  0.132  7.5541    3          (    6  3    )        (    43  3    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 3}{43 \choose 3} \over {49 \choose 6}}    8,815/499,422  0.0177  56.66    4          (    6  4    )        (    43  2    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 4}{43 \choose 2} \over {49 \choose 6}}    645/665,896  0.000969  1,032.4    5          (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}    43/2,330,636  0.0000184  54,200.8    6          (    6  6    )        (    43  0    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 6}{43 \choose 0} \over {49 \choose 6}}    1/13,983,816  0.0000000715  13,983,816    When a bonus number is included, the adjusted odds are: [1]    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    5, bonus not won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )   1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000180208  55,491.33    5, bonus won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )    (  1  −  1  )     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose (1-1)} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000004291  2,330,636    Pick8-32 odds and calculations [ edit ]  The Pick8-32 Lottery game by Trillion Coins [2] implements a lotto game ticket where 8 numbers from 01 to 32 are selected in any order and can be repeated. The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

In the 5-from-90 lotto, the minimum number of tickets that can guarantee a ticket with at least 2 matches is 100. [3]  References [ edit ]     ^  Zabrocki, Mike (2003-03-01).

If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .  This gives the following results:    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    0          (    6  0    )        (    43  6    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 0}{43 \choose 6} \over {49 \choose 6}}    435,461/998,844  0.436  2.2938    1          (    6  1    )        (    43  5    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 1}{43 \choose 5} \over {49 \choose 6}}    68,757/166,474  0.413  2.4212    2          (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4} \over {49 \choose 6}}    44,075/332,948  0.132  7.5541    3          (    6  3    )        (    43  3    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 3}{43 \choose 3} \over {49 \choose 6}}    8,815/499,422  0.0177  56.66    4          (    6  4    )        (    43  2    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 4}{43 \choose 2} \over {49 \choose 6}}    645/665,896  0.000969  1,032.4    5          (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}    43/2,330,636  0.0000184  54,200.8    6          (    6  6    )        (    43  0    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 6}{43 \choose 0} \over {49 \choose 6}}    1/13,983,816  0.0000000715  13,983,816    When a bonus number is included, the adjusted odds are: [1]    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    5, bonus not won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )   1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000180208  55,491.33    5, bonus won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )    (  1  −  1  )     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose (1-1)} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000004291  2,330,636    Pick8-32 odds and calculations [ edit ]  The Pick8-32 Lottery game by Trillion Coins [2] implements a lotto game ticket where 8 numbers from 01 to 32 are selected in any order and can be repeated. The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237.

Contents    1  Choosing 6 from 49  2  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49  3  Pick8-32 odds and calculations  4  Powerballs And Bonus Balls  5  Minimum number of tickets for a match  6  References  7  External links     Choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  In a typical 6/49 game, each player chooses six non-duplicate numbers from a range of 1-49. If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .  This gives the following results:    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    0          (    6  0    )        (    43  6    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 0}{43 \choose 6} \over {49 \choose 6}}    435,461/998,844  0.436  2.2938    1          (    6  1    )        (    43  5    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 1}{43 \choose 5} \over {49 \choose 6}}    68,757/166,474  0.413  2.4212    2          (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4} \over {49 \choose 6}}    44,075/332,948  0.132  7.5541    3          (    6  3    )        (    43  3    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 3}{43 \choose 3} \over {49 \choose 6}}    8,815/499,422  0.0177  56.66    4          (    6  4    )        (    43  2    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 4}{43 \choose 2} \over {49 \choose 6}}    645/665,896  0.000969  1,032.4    5          (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}    43/2,330,636  0.0000184  54,200.8    6          (    6  6    )        (    43  0    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 6}{43 \choose 0} \over {49 \choose 6}}    1/13,983,816  0.0000000715  13,983,816    When a bonus number is included, the adjusted odds are: [1]    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    5, bonus not won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )   1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000180208  55,491.33    5, bonus won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )    (  1  −  1  )     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose (1-1)} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000004291  2,330,636    Pick8-32 odds and calculations [ edit ]  The Pick8-32 Lottery game by Trillion Coins [2] implements a lotto game ticket where 8 numbers from 01 to 32 are selected in any order and can be repeated. The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .

The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.  The general formula for     B    {\displaystyle B}   matching balls in a     N    {\displaystyle N}   choose     K    {\displaystyle K}   lottery with one bonus ball from the     N    {\displaystyle N}   pool of balls is:         K  −  B    N  −  K        (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K-B \over N-K}{K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}    The general formula for     B    {\displaystyle B}   matching balls in a     N    {\displaystyle N}   choose     K    {\displaystyle K}   lottery with zero bonus ball from the     N    {\displaystyle N}   pool of balls is:         N  −  K  −  K  +  B    N  −  K        (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {N-K-K+B \over N-K}{K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}    The general formula for     B    {\displaystyle B}   matching balls in a     N    {\displaystyle N}   choose     K    {\displaystyle K}   lottery with one bonus ball from a separate pool of     P    {\displaystyle P}   balls is:        1  P       (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {1 \over P}{K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}    The general formula for     B    {\displaystyle B}   matching balls in a     N    {\displaystyle N}   choose     K    {\displaystyle K}   lottery with no bonus ball from a separate pool of     P    {\displaystyle P}   balls is:         P  −  1   P       (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {P-1 \over P}{K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}    Minimum number of tickets for a match [ edit ]  It is a hard (and often open) problem to calculate the minimum number of tickets one needs to purchase to guarantee that at least one of these tickets matches at least 2 numbers. In the 5-from-90 lotto, the minimum number of tickets that can guarantee a ticket with at least 2 matches is 100. [3]  References [ edit ]     ^  Zabrocki, Mike (2003-03-01).

Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !

This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .  This gives the following results:    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    0          (    6  0    )        (    43  6    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 0}{43 \choose 6} \over {49 \choose 6}}    435,461/998,844  0.436  2.2938    1          (    6  1    )        (    43  5    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 1}{43 \choose 5} \over {49 \choose 6}}    68,757/166,474  0.413  2.4212    2          (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4} \over {49 \choose 6}}    44,075/332,948  0.132  7.5541    3          (    6  3    )        (    43  3    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 3}{43 \choose 3} \over {49 \choose 6}}    8,815/499,422  0.0177  56.66    4          (    6  4    )        (    43  2    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 4}{43 \choose 2} \over {49 \choose 6}}    645/665,896  0.000969  1,032.4    5          (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}    43/2,330,636  0.0000184  54,200.8    6          (    6  6    )        (    43  0    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 6}{43 \choose 0} \over {49 \choose 6}}    1/13,983,816  0.0000000715  13,983,816    When a bonus number is included, the adjusted odds are: [1]    Score  Calculation  Exact Probability  Approximate Decimal Probability  Approximate 1/Probability    5, bonus not won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )   1    )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose 1} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000180208  55,491.33    5, bonus won          (    6  5    )        (     (  43  −  1  )    (  1  −  1  )     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{(43-1) \choose (1-1)} \over {49 \choose 6}}     0.0000004291  2,330,636    Pick8-32 odds and calculations [ edit ]  The Pick8-32 Lottery game by Trillion Coins [2] implements a lotto game ticket where 8 numbers from 01 to 32 are selected in any order and can be repeated. The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.  The general formula for     B    {\displaystyle B}   matching balls in a     N    {\displaystyle N}   choose     K    {\displaystyle K}   lottery with one bonus ball from the     N    {\displaystyle N}   pool of balls is:         K  −  B    N  −  K        (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K-B \over N-K}{K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}    The general formula for     B    {\displaystyle B}   matching balls in a     N    {\displaystyle N}   choose     K    {\displaystyle K}   lottery with zero bonus ball from the     N    {\displaystyle N}   pool of balls is:         N  −  K  −  K  +  B    N  −  K        (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {N-K-K+B \over N-K}{K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}    The general formula for     B    {\displaystyle B}   matching balls in a     N    {\displaystyle N}   choose     K    {\displaystyle K}   lottery with one bonus ball from a separate pool of     P    {\displaystyle P}   balls is:        1  P       (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {1 \over P}{K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}    The general formula for     B    {\displaystyle B}   matching balls in a     N    {\displaystyle N}   choose     K    {\displaystyle K}   lottery with no bonus ball from a separate pool of     P    {\displaystyle P}   balls is:         P  −  1   P       (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {P-1 \over P}{K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}    Minimum number of tickets for a match [ edit ]  It is a hard (and often open) problem to calculate the minimum number of tickets one needs to purchase to guarantee that at least one of these tickets matches at least 2 numbers. In the 5-from-90 lotto, the minimum number of tickets that can guarantee a ticket with at least 2 matches is 100. [3]  References [ edit ]     ^  Zabrocki, Mike (2003-03-01).

Here are some things to think about:  You have better chances of getting into a car accident, plane accident, or struck my lightning, than to win your lottery.  1/3 of people in the United States think winning the lottery is the only way to become financially secure in life.     How many correct numbers must you choose in order to win? (e.g. how many numbered balls or tokens are drawn for each lottery?)      What is the lowest number you can choose?    What is the highest number you can choose?         Note:
This calculation assumes that only one of each possible number will appear in the "winning numbers."  That is,
a given number, say 10, can only appear ONCE in the winning combination (most work this way).        Quick! I need help with:  Choose Math Help Item ...

As a mathematician, I have never purchased a lottery ticket. I find the odds depressing and have never had luck in winning anything from these kinds of games.  This hub is all about calculating lottery probability or odds. In order to make it more relevant to me, I decided to base it on the Grandlotto 6/55, the lottery game with the biggest prize money here in the Philippines. There will be two different cases discussed in the hub: the probability of winning the game with all six numbers matching, and the probability of having n numbers matching.   Rules of the Lottery Game It is always important to find out the rules of any game before participating in it. For the Grandlotto 6/55, in order to win the jackpot prize, you have to match six numbers from a pool of 55 numbers ranging from 1-55. The initial payout is a minimum of P20 (or around $0.47). It is also possible to win some money if you are able to match three, four, or five numbers of the winning combination. Note that the order of the winning combination here does not matter.  Here is a table for the prizes you can obtain:     No. of Matching Nos.   Prize Money (in Php)   Prize Money (in $)   6   minimum of 30 million   ~700,000   5   150,000   ~3,500   4   2,000   ~47   3   150   ~4      Some Probability Concepts Before we start with the calculations, I would like to talk about Permutations and Combinations . This is one of the basic concepts you learn in Probability Theory. The main difference being that permutations consider order to be important, while in combinations, order isn't important.  In a lottery ticket, permutation should be used if the numbers in your ticket have to match the order of the draw for the winning string of numbers. In the Grandlotto 6/55, order is not important because so long as you have the winning set of numbers, you can win the prize.  The next formulas only apply for numbers without repetition . This means that if the number x is drawn, it cannot be drawn again. If the number drawn from the set is returned before the next draw, then that has repetition.   This is the formula for Permutations, where order is important. | Source       This is the formula for Combinations, where order is not important. | Source   , where n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.  Note that based on the formulas given, C(n,k) is always less than or equal to P(n,k). You will see later on why it is important to make this distinction for calculating lottery odds or probability.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability for 6 Matching Numbers So now that we know the basic concepts of permutations and combinations, let us go back to the example of Grandlotto 6/55. For the game, n = 55, the total number of possible choices. k = 6, the number of choices we can make. Because order is not important, we will use the formula for combination:   Source   These are the odds or the total number of possible combinations for any 6-digit number to win the game. To find the probability, just divide 1 by the number above, and you will get: 0.0000000344 or 0.00000344%. See what I mean by depressing odds?  So what if we're talking about a different lottery game where order does matter. We will now use the permutation formula to get the following:   Source   Compare these two results and you will see that the odds for getting the winning combination where order matters has 3 additional zero's! It's going from about 28 million:1 odds to 20 billion:1 odds! The probability of winning for this case is 1 divided by the odds which equals to 0.0000000000479 or 0.00000000479%.  As you can see, because the permutation is always greater than or equal to the combination, the probability of winning a game where order matters is always less than or equal to the probability of winning a game where order does not matter. Because the risk is greater for games where order is required, this implies that the reward must also be higher.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability with Less Than 6 Matching Numbers Because you can also win prizes if you have less than 6 matching numbers, this section will show you how to calculate the probability if there are x matches to the winning set of numbers.  First, we need to find the number of way to choose x winning numbers from the set and multiply it by the number of ways to choose the losing numbers for the remaining 6-x numbers. Consider the number of ways to choose x winning numbers. Because there are only 6 possible winning numbers, in essence, we are only choosing x from a pool of 6. And so, because order does not matter, we get C(6, x).  Next, we consider the number of ways to choose the remaining 6-x balls from the pool of losing numbers. Because 6 are winning numbers, we have 55 - 6 = 49 balls to choose the losing numbers from. So, the number of possibilities for choosing a losing ball can be obtained from C(49, 6 - x). Again, order does not matter here.  So, in order to calculate the probability of winning with x matching numbers out of a possible 6, we need to divide the outcome from the previous two paragraphs by the total number of possibilities to win with all 6 matching numbers. We get:       Source   If we write this in a more general form, we get:   Source   , where n = total number of balls in the set, k = total number of balls in the winning combination for the jackpot prize, and x = total numbers of balls matching the winning set of numbers.  If we use this formula to calculate the probability (and the odds) of winning the Grandlotto 6/55 with only x matching numbers, we get the following:     x matches   Calculation   Probability   Odds (1/Probability)   0   C(6,0) * C(49,6)/C(55,6)   0.48237   2.07308   1   C(6,1) * C(49,5)/C(55,6)   0.39466   2.53777   2   C(6,2) * C(49,4)/C(55,6)   0.10963   9.12158   3   C(6,3) * C(49,3)/C(55,6)   0.01271   78.67367   4   C(6,4) * C(49,2)/C(55,6)   0.00060   1643.40561   5   C(6,5) * C(49,1)/C(55,6)   0.00001   98604.33673   6   C(6,6) * C(49,0)/C(55,6)   0.00000003   28989675      How to Choose the Winning Numbers in Lottery As you can see from the math in this hub, the probability of winning the lottery is the same for any 6-number combination available in the Grandlotto 6/55 game. This is also applicable for other lottery games out there.  As I was researching for this hub, I came across links that said never choose numbers that are sequential, like from 1-6 or some such nonsense. There is no such secret to winning the lottery! Each number is as equally likely to come up in the draw as the next number.  If you are willing to face the very little probability of winning the lottery, I say go choose any number you want. You can base it on your birthdays, special days, anniversaries, lucky numbers, etc. Just remember that with great risk comes great reward!

However there are also many factors(known and many unknown) which produces lottery results that happen to produce patterns, which may help in striking like few matching numbers but still ultra difficult in winning 6 matching numbers. It's still a combination of luck, for now i conclude it's combination of probability+luck (L.O.A or whatever u wanna call it)...cheers n good luck hehe  Author dezalyx 2 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Subs. From the definition of classical probability, every statistical outcome will contain elements that are equally likely to happen. This means that if you roll a 6-sided dice, it is equally probable that the outcome will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Or in the case of flipping a coin, the probability of heads will be equal to the probability of tails. No magic coins, no loaded dice, all equally probable to happen. When calculating the lottery probability in this article, this assumption is already used. This is usually the case when calculating probabilities theoretically. Having no affiliation to companies who hold the lottery, it would be difficult for me to assume that certain balls are more likely to surface because they are loaded. In my opinion, historical data does not have any bearing on lottery outcomes. Statistically speaking, working on other probability approaches will not work because of this. Just because the number N appears frequently in lottery drawings, does not mean that the ball is more likely to surface than the number N+1 in the next drawing.  Subs 2 months ago  Can the classical probability theory be used here? And please give an example  Subs 2 months ago  What other probability approaches can be used?  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Odds. Thanks for commenting. I did not say choosing one's birthday would contribute to one's luck. I just said you can choose any number you want if you're willing to face the fact that there's only a very small chance that you can win the jackpot prize. Heck, you could choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 if you wanted to. The basis of this article is that the probability of each ball getting drawn is the same as any other ball in the lottery. While I kept getting comments on how likely certain numbers will get picked over other numbers, mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as having weighted balls for lottery drawings. While you might not have studied mathematics, you certainly were on point when you said that you should never try your luck in gambling. That's actually a mathematician's saying. Never gamble, because the house always wins.  ODDS 7 months ago  I didn't study mathematics, but you were wrong when you mentioned that the numbers of the player's birthday would contribute to his luck, rather it would add up to the improbability, because certainly the player would not live enough to wait his birthday's numbers to come up! And yeah you certainly can top up your chances even if mathematically every number may pop up randomly. If i were to buy a ticket, i would consider not selecting numbers that are altogether evens/odds, divisible by 5 altogether etc. If the order does not matter, you will get more chances! But you know what, never try your luck in gambling, it's made to steal your money and you end up depressed.  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, jazer. I've been receiving a ton of comments lately asking for what the winning number will be for the next lottery draw, but the article is just about the probability of winning the lottery. I don't know about the specifics of the composition of lotto balls, since it probably differs for every company that makes them, but looking for trends when there is no factual basis will just result in you losing money. And given the odds of winning the lottery, you would be better off investing that money in something else with a higher chance of getting a profit. While I agree with the idea that maybe the composition of the balls would get it drawn more than the others, you can never bank on that, since it could be changed without you ever knowing about it (repainting the balls numbers, changing the balls entirely, having different sets of balls for different drawings, etc.).      jazer 8 months ago  Probability is probability. We cannot predict the future. But for the purpose of conversation, some people used they called a "trend". A history of past result. From trend you may "guess" which number can be with higher probability. Is this true in nature? Actually, this is only my opinion. My reasoning with the trend is somewhat related to the composition of the lotto balls e.g. weight, etc, that's why some numbers were drawn more that the others. What is your opinion on this? Thanks.  Kgomotso Comfort 9 months ago  I just want know how can I calculate the probabilities of 6/49  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Edgard, it seems to me that your question is still about the gambler's fallacy. Just because a certain number comes out approximately 6 times out of x number of drawings will not change the probability of the number being drawn again in the future. Imagine changing the game into a simple heads or tails coin flip. The probability of getting either outcome is 1/2. Just because you get 6 heads in a row does not mean the next result would be a tail. Even if you get 100 heads in a row, the probability of getting either outcome is still going to be 1/2. There won't be any probability equations to predict what you are looking for. If there is, the people who have discovered such equations would already be taking advantage of the lottery system. The only thing you can do with the study is plot historical graphs on how many times a certain number has come out previously and marvel at how some numbers seem to appear more than others.  Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalix, We really appreciate your time and answers We are aware that there will always be an average for any set of numbers, also we can find a trend to explain any series of numbers, but these work outs are not a guaranty that we will get really meaningful results. Our previous questions came out from the following fact: We made a sequential review of winning numbers of 260 draws of a 6/45 lottery, to find out the number of times (frequency) that each of the 45 balls was drawn; we started with a 160 draws sample, and increased the sample with 10 draws data each time, until we got the last sample of 260 draws; with every sample of draws, we worked out the rate = [total draws of the sample / frequency of each ball in the sample] for every ball, then we worked out the average of this 45 ratios; the result clearly showed a steady trend for this average, which started at 6.63, for the 160 draws sample, to 6.55 for the 260 draws sample; of course we could work with more sample, but we just decided to stop at 260 draws sample. We initially thought this ratio means the average number of draws we expect to wait for a ball to be drawn; but, what would be the right mining of this average (6.55), if any?, why the average has a steady trend?, and is there any probability equation to predict this average? ratio ni = [N° draws/Freq ni] i = [1, 45] Samples	       Average N° Draws	of ratios      Min ratio  Max ratio 260	                6.55	      4.73            8.97 250	                6.56	      4.63	          8.93 240	                6.57	      4.44	          8.57 230	                6.59	      4.26	          8.85 220	                6.58	      4.31	          8.46 210	                6.59	      4.29	          9.13 200	                6.61	      4.17	          9.09 190	                6.61	      4.13	          8.64 180	                6.62	      3.91	          9.00 170	                6.62	      3.95	          8.95 160	                6.63	      3.81	          8.89 Regards Edgard  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines No. The law of large numbers indicate that given a large number of opportunities, we should expect a certain event to happen again, no matter how unlikely it may be. For example, a set of 6 lottery numbers can get picked 2 weeks in a row. But, just because it happened, doesn't mean you should go running to buy the same exact set of numbers in the hopes of getting lucky. Each lottery picking is still independent of each other. So the probability of picking the correct set of numbers will remain the same for each drawing. Saying that one number has the chance to be drawn every specific number of games is succumbing to gambler's fallacy (mistaken belief that just because something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future). Odds represent the ratio that allow you to calculate how much money you will win on your bet in comparison to your stake. So your $10 ticket can become $23.67 if one number gets drawn. That is why you will notice that the odds keep increasing as you get more matches, meaning you get more money the more matches you get. I hope this answers your question, Edgard.      Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalyx, Thanks again, Regarding the same game 6/45: As the probability of one match is  0.42417, then Odds (1/Probability) will be 2.3678. According to probability theory and the law of large numbers, is it right to say, at least theoretically, that every 2.3678 games we should expect one match; in other words, one number has the chance to be drawn every 2.3678 games?  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Edgar. Just replace the numbers in the formula (from 55 to 45, 49 to 39) then solve for the answer to your question. [0.4241]  Edgard 11 months ago  ¿What would be the probability of one single ball to be part of the winner combination in a game where we have to pick a 6 number combination out of 45 numbers?. Thanks in advance for your answer!  Steve Ho Ong 2 years ago  from Dumaguete City This article is very clear because it is a step by step procedure.

Photo: Martin Barraud/Getty Images     By  Kimberly Amadeo    Updated November 07, 2017   The biggest lottery jackpot ever was $1.6 billion on January 13, 2016. Authorities announced three winning Powerball tickets in California, Tennessee, and Florida. That beats the Mega Millions on March 31, 2012. Three winners split a $656 million jackpot. The winning tickets were sold in Illinois, Maryland, and Kansas. Those states don't have to reveal the names of the winners. The prior largest Powerball payout was close behind, at $590.5 million.         Gloria C. Mackenzie, an 84-year old Floridian, won on June 5, 2013. The odds of winning either the Powerball or Mega Millions were roughly the same: 175 million to one . Despite those odds, one-third of Americans believe that winning the lottery is the only way they will ever retire. But how likely is it? Here's a humorous look comparing the odds of winning the lottery to some other lucky and unlucky events. That's followed by strategies that are more likely to win you a bountiful retirement . Things That Are More Likely Than Winning the Lottery If you believe in the odds of winning the lottery, then you should never fly or drive. That because you are more apt to be killed in a plane crash, where the odds are 25 million to one, and far more likely to die in a car accident, where the odds are only 5,000 to one. Similarly, you should start sleeping on the floor and taking showers. That's because the odds of being killed by falling out of bed are 2 million to one, while the odds of drowning while taking a bath are 840,000 to one.   But don't think you can improve your chances by avoiding cleanliness altogether. The odds of dying from a flesh-eating bacteria are only 1 million to one. Maybe you'll have better luck outside. Not! The odds of being killed by lightning are 2 million to one while being mauled to death by a dog are 700,000 to one.         Bring your anti-venom kit, because you are even more likely to die from a snake bite or bee sting, where the odds are 100,000 to one. If these statistics have you feeling a little paranoid, cheer up. Many good things are also more likely than winning the lottery. For example, the odds of becoming a movie star are only 1.5 million to one, while the odds of getting a royal flush in the first hand of poker are just 649,740 to one. Even better (guys), the odds of dating a supermodel are a measly 88,000 to one. To put it all into perspective, consider this. Scientists have calculated that there is just a 300 to one chance that asteroid 2004 MN4 will strike the Earth on April 13, 2029. The asteroid is about a quarter mile (400 meters) wide. That is larger than the asteroid that carved out Meteor Crater in Arizona, and the one that flattened thousands of square miles of forest in Siberia in 1908. Things You No Longer Have to Worry About OK, time for a little cheering up again. Many bad things are less likely than winning the lottery. For example, it's safe to go back into the water. The odds of dying from a shark attack are 300 million to one, only half as likely as winning the lottery. Swimming with the sharks is much safer than petting a dog, driving your car, or sleeping in your bed.          How to Improve Your Odds If you've read all these statistics, and still want to play the lottery, here are some ways to improve your chances. First, use the computer-generated numbers, they tend to be the luckiest. That's because there is less chance of someone else picking a duplicate number. Furthermore, only 30 percent of the winning numbers were the players' "lucky" numbers. Whatever you do, don't pick "lucky" seven, 11, or a birthday. You can be sure that someone else will have also picked those numbers. Second, be sure to play the $1 million or $2 million second prize in the Powerball. There, you only have to match five of the six numbers. Those odds are one out of 5 million. You get even better odds if you just play in the state lotteries instead of the national one. How to Improve Your Chances of Attaining Retirement Perhaps you are one of those who consider the lottery their best chance of retiring.  Well, consider this comparison instead. Let's say you currently buy a $2 lottery ticket every week for the next 17 years (before the 300 to one chance the asteroid hits Earth). There is little likelihood, based on the odds, that you would have won. If you instead invested that $2 a week in securities and got a 5 percent return, you would have accumulated $2,926. Doesn't sound like much, does it? Let's say you invested $2 a day instead. You would wind up with $20,5361 by 2029. Your return will probably be greater than that. Before the 2008 financial crisis , the average stock market return was 10 percent a year. If you get that return over the next 17 years, then your $2 a day would become $33,287. True, that's not enough to retire on. But what if you increased it to $5 a day. You'd wind up with $83,220. Or doubled that, and invested $10 a day, you'd get $166,436. Now you're talking. The point is that you do have better odds for a successful retirement if you plan for it than by playing the lottery. You don't have to depend on fate, chance or luck. You can take matters into your own hands, starting today.

          Updated Dec 29, 2017 2:14 PM EST   'Tis the season to start dreaming: Prizes for the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries have climbed past $300 million , with drawings set for Friday and Saturday. But don't quit your day job just yet. The odds of winning one of the jackpots is roughly one in 259 million for Mega Millions and one in 292 million for Powerball. And the chances of winning both, for those of you thinking really big? Roughly one in 75 quadrillion -- that's 15 zeros -- according to data scientists at Allstate. To understand how unlikely those odds are, it's worth comparing them to the probability of other unlikely events. Americans are much more likely to get struck by lightning (odds of one in 13,500) or to die in a car accident (one in 645). While the old lottery campaign "You've got to be in it to win it" holds true, the real value in buying a ticket may simply be to enjoy the dream of winning.     The Powerball website announced Thursday that no winning tickets had been sold. The estimated top prize for the next drawing on Saturday night is $384 million, or a cash prize of $242.9 million. The estimated Mega Millions jackpot is $306 million (or a cash option of $191 million), with the next drawing set for Friday at 11 p.m. Eastern time. Tickets cost $2. Sales time cut-offs vary by state but are usually one to two hours before the drawing. The average American spends about $200 a year on lottery tickets , though residents of some states spend far more. According to a study by LendEDU, the average Massachusetts resident spends $735 annually on lottery tickets . Rhode Islanders plop down $514 a year. And if you live in Delaware or New York, you're likely spending about $400 a year, or $33 per month (see map below). The odds of winning "scratchers" -- those little instant winning tickets that you can buy for prices ranging from $1 to $50 -- are better, but it's still no way to get rich. LendEDU experimented with determining "a return on investment" with scratchers by buying $1,000 worth of tickets. The good news: The site won with 68 of the 314 tickets -- indicating that you have a near 22 percent chance of a positive return with lottery scratchers. And, in fact, a big win ($500) on a $20 ticket helped the lending site recover the bulk of its investment. The bad news: Like most players, LendEDU lost money in the end, recovering just $974 of its $1,000. That amounts to an average return on investment of -2.6 percent. So who does make out in lottery sales? Convenience stores. Big jackpots tend to bring customers into gas stations and convenience stores, said Jeff Lenard, vice president of strategic industry initiatives at the National Association of Convenience Stores. Its members sell about two-thirds of all lottery tickets in the U.S. The giant Powerball and Mega Million jackpots are feeding on each other, with customers coming into stores to buy a ticket for one and noticing the other jackpot, he said.     "The key thing for awareness is really, once you go into the store to buy one, there's that screen that shows that there's another big jackpot," Lenard said. "It's that digital signage inside the store that's driving that double interest." Convenience stores make about a dime on a $2 ticket, or about 5 percent to 6 percent on each dollar spent. Winning stores also earn a commission, although the amount varies by state. Following are the odds of winning the jackpots, as calculated by Allstate, along with the chances of other unlikely events: Being a victim of identity theft by the age of 40 : 1 in 6 Getting bitten by a dog while out for a jog : 1 in 133 Getting a hole in one on your birthday : 1 in 25,000 Having all of the above happen to one person : 1 in 19,900,000 Winning Powerball: 1 in 292,201,338 Winning Mega Millions : 1 in 258,890,850 Winning both Powerball and Mega Millions : 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

Kevin Breuninger | @KevinWilliamB   Published  1:12  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018  Updated   1:42  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018  CNBC.com                show chapters               U.S. lottery players now have two chances at jackpots of more than $300 million   4:30  PM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  00:37       If your retirement plan involves winning either of this weekend's multi-million dollar lottery jackpots, sorry — you're far more likely to be killed by a falling asteroid.   The combined Powerball and the Mega Millions jackpots are the largest ever , at more than $1 billion. The Powerball jackpot is currently $570 million, and the Mega Millions stands at $450 million. Both games had their most recent jackpot wins in late October.  The next Mega Millions drawing is scheduled for 11 p.m. ET on Friday, and the next Powerball drawing is Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.   Two lottery drawings does technically imply more opportunities to win — but really, you should check your hopes at the convenience store counter.  The odds of winning the Powerball grand prize are 1 in 292.2 million, according to the game's own assessment . The Mega Millions jackpot odds are even more hopeless, at 1 in 302.5 million.  (In late October, Mega Millions changed its range of numbers players can choose from, which made the odds of winning the big jackpot slimmer. Before that change, its jackpot odds were 1 in 258.9 million.)  A few points of comparison. Your odds of being struck dead by a stray asteroid are just 1 in 1.9 million, according to Jim Murphy at sportsbettingexperts.com . The odds of being killed by a shark are even less likely at 1 in 3.7 million.       Getty Images   Yet both of these improbabilities are exponentially more likely than winning the whole bonanza in either of this weekend's lottery drawings.  And perish the thought of winning both the Mega Millions and the Powerball. An Allstate analysis from mid-2017 (before the Mega Millions top prize odds worsened) put the chance of a double-win at 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300. (That's 75 quadrillion.)  For those lucky few who do win the lottery, be prepared to sacrifice a hefty chunk of your winnings in tax payments almost immediately.  Lottery site USAMega.com estimates the federal tax withholding on the $281.2 million Mega Millions lump sum would be $70.3 million, and state taxes could knock out up to another $24.8 million (with New York the worst offender). For the Powerball, those tax tallies for the $358.5 million cash prize would be $89.6 million and up to $31.6 million, respectively.

Tweet This     on Saturday night, someone could win the largest Powerball lottery ever, $700 million    Every time you buy a quick pick, you get a different set of numbers; therefore, your odds are always going to be at their worst in that particular game,      I defy you to find anyone who has never fantasized about winning the lottery. The house! The travel! The help for loved ones and favorite charities! Someone to deliver a single, perfect piece of chocolate to your door every day! (OK, maybe that's just me.)  While most of us will never see that kind of money dumped in our laps, a select few lottery winners do actually get to realize their fantasy—and  on Saturday night, someone could win the largest Powerball lottery ever, $700 million .         Richard Lustig of Orlando, FL, has won seven lottery grand prizes through a system he developed.        One of the “luckiest” people in the nation is Richard Lustig, author of Learn How To Increase Your Chances of Winning the Lottery , who has won seven lottery grand prizes and perfected his strategy though trial and error. “When the lottery came to Florida, I was like everybody else: ‘Wow, buy lottery tickets, win a lot of money, retire, buy a big fancy yacht, whatever, blah, blah, blah,’” he said. “Like everybody else, I was running out and buying haphazardly, buying quick picks, I mean buying tickets with no plan, or no method, or whatever. Like everybody else, I was losing all the time.”  Then Lustig realized there had to be a way to increase his chances. Every time something worked, he’d write it down. Eventually, he had a “formula” that worked for him and others. His main tips--which don't all follow strict mathematical logic, and have been discounted by some as nonsense --for those playing lotteries are below:    Don’t use the “quick-pick” numbers generated from the store’s computer. Even though it seems like every number has an equal amount of “luck,” certain number sets are better than others. “  Every time you buy a quick pick, you get a different set of numbers; therefore, your odds are always going to be at their worst in that particular game, whatever game you're playing. In this case, the hype, of course, is all about the Powerball right now,” Lustig says.  Go beyond the birthdays. The spread is important—if you always choose birth month and dates, like most people do, you’re relegating yourself to less than half the numbers available, 1 through 31. Equally important about including bigger numbers: “If you pick your own numbers and only play birthdays and anniversaries, you’re splitting the pot with 20-40 people. If you spread the numbers out across the whole track, you’ll either be the only winner or will split it with only one or two people,” Lustig says.  Don’t change the numbers. Once you’ve determined which numbers are “good,” (he recommends a specific way to find these in his book) don’t switch them, play them every time. If you buy more than one card, use a different set of numbers. “Remember, a set of numbers wins the grand prize, not individual numbers,” Lustig says. He says it’s OK to repeat a number or two, but be sure each group of numbers is mostly different so you increase your odds. (Though, if you're looking at this in a solid math sense, in a fair lottery, every number has the same probability of being drawn.)  Play consistently. “Never miss a drawing in the game you’re playing. Every Saturday, every Wednesday, every week,” Lustig says.  Understand the odds, but know your limits : If you play 100 cards, you’ll have a better chance than if you pay just 10—but only play what you can afford to lose. It’s not a regular investment, as in an IRA or a stock. “One of the things that I preach to people all the time is budget, budget, budget,” Lustig says. “Set a budget of what you're going to spend. Do not get caught up in what's called lottery fever. Don't spend grocery money. Don't spend rent money. Figure out what you can afford to spend. Don't worry about how much Joe Blow down the street is spending. … Figure out what your budget is, what you can comfortably afford to spend, and stay within that budget."

Of course, plenty of financial professionals say it's never worth it to play the lottery. Even though there's a lot to be gained, in general, playing Powerball is still a bad decision because you never get the full jackpot, and chances are  you'll be splitting it, says Paul Dreyer, a mathematician for the RAND Corporation (who, for the record, fully disagrees with the logic of Lustig's method).
