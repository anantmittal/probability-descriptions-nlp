Hide Caption 29 of 29 Story highlights Only 1 in 5 people will develop any symptoms; symptoms are typically mild and temporary There is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection (CNN) The Zika virus was discovered nearly 70 years ago, but chances are you probably hadn't heard of it until the past few months. With fear and uncertainty spreading as quickly as the virus itself, CNN Health wanted to address some of your pressing questions on the topic. To stay informed on the latest Zika news and most up-to-date information, bookmark: CNN.com/Zika . Should I be worried about Zika? The Zika virus is part of the same family as yellow fever , West Nile , chikungunya and dengue . But there is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection. Read More Even though symptoms are most often mild, Zika is commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly , a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. It causes severe developmental issues and, in some cases, can result in death. What are the chances I'll get the Zika virus? The virus is most commonly transmitted when an Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a person with an active infection and then spreads the virus by biting others. Originally discovered in a Ugandan forest, the aggressive mosquito is now predominantly raising concerns in Central and South America. If there are no infected mosquitoes in your area, you're very unlikely to contract the disease. Zika has been sexually transmitted in Texas, CDC confirms On February 2, the CDC confirmed the first case of sexually transmitted Zika in the latest outbreak. A male patient who had recently returned from Venezuela infected with Zika returned to the United States and infected his sexual partner, who had not traveled. The CDC issued interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus and noted that "there have been no reports of sexual transmission of Zika virus from infected women to their sex partners." "Until we know more, if your male sexual partner has traveled to or lives in an area with active Zika virus transmission, you should abstain from sex or use condoms the right way every time you have vaginal, anal and oral sex for the duration of the pregnancy," the updated guidance says. CDC issues new safe-sex guidelines around Zika virus While the virus has been documented in breast milk, saliva and urine, it has not yet been confirmed if the virus can be transmitted through any bodily fluids other than blood. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta , "There have been isolated cases of spread through blood transfusion or sexual contact and that's not very surprising. The virus is in the blood for about a week. How long it would remain in the semen is something that needs to be studied and we're working on that now." Frieden said that studies on sexual transmission are not easy studies to do, but the CDC is continuing to explore that avenue of transmission. "What we know is the vast majority of spread is going to be from mosquitoes," Frieden said. "The bottom line is mosquitoes are the real culprit here." What are the symptoms and effects? Only about one in five people infected with Zika virus will actually become ill, according to the CDC . "The most common symptoms of Zika are fever are rash, joint pain or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other symptoms include muscle pain and headache," the CDC says. For most people, the illness is mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. People don't usually get sick enough to require a hospital visit, and the virus very rarely results in death. JUST WATCHED What is the Zika virus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the Zika virus?  01:32 More seriously, Zika has been linked the birth defect microcephaly, as well as Guillain-Barré , a rare syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves. It's important to note: a link does not necessarily indicate cause and effect. Aside from either of these conditions, there are no lasting, long-term effects of Zika. Additionally, once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections, according to the CDC. What should I do if I think I've been exposed? If you think you may have been exposed to the Zika virus, stop and ask yourself these three questions: 1. Are you pregnant? 2. Are you a woman who is thinking about getting pregnant? 3. Are you a man who is going to have unprotected sex with a woman who is pregnant or may become pregnant? If your answer to all of these questions is "no," there is arguably no reason for you to get tested. Remember, only 20% people who contract the virus will even develop any symptoms, and those who do will experience only mild and short-lived discomfort. If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, however, you should contact your doctor about being tested for Zika. He or she can order blood tests to look for Zika or other similar viral diseases, such as dengue or chikungunya. A blood test performed in a clinical setting is the only way to be definitively diagnosed. How I can I be treated if I have the Zika virus? Unfortunately, as of now, there is no vaccine or specific medicine to treat Zika virus infections. Instead, the CDC recommends treating the symptoms: -- Get plenty of rest. -- Drink fluids to prevent dehydration. -- Take medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce fever and pain. -- Do not take aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If you are taking medicine for another medical condition, talk to your health care provider before taking additional medication. How can I keep myself safe in the U.S. or abroad? How to keep away mosquitoes carrying Zika, dengue With no vaccine available, the only protection against Zika is to avoid traveling to areas with an active infestation. If you do travel to a country where Zika is present, the CDC advises strict adherence to mosquito protection measures: Use an EPA-approved repellent over sunscreen, wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts thick enough to block a mosquito bite, and sleep in an air-conditioned, screened room. If you have Zika, you can keep from spreading it to others by avoiding mosquito bites during the first week of illness, the CDC said. The female Aedes aegypti, the primary carrier of Zika, is an aggressive biter, preferring daytime to dusk and indoors to outdoors. Keeping screens on windows and doors is critical to preventing entry to homes and hotel rooms.

By Alexandra Sifferlin  June 23, 2017        TIME Health  For more, visit TIME Health .   Last summer, public health experts were on high alert due to the rapid spread of the Zika virus , which has now been proven to cause birth defects and other health problems in infants. Today, experts know far more about the virus than they did at the start of the outbreak. Here’s what you need to know now about Zika.  Should pregnant women worry about Zika while traveling?  Short answer: yes. “Our general advice is that if you are pregnant, you should not go to places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing,” says Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “It’s all a matter of risk. Obviously, if you are staying in an air-conditioned hotel, your risk may be less. However, are you willing to take that risk? We know the consequences of infection of the fetus are huge and lifelong.”      Petersen recommends people check the CDC website for guidance on what locations have active Zika transmission. The CDC updates this list regularly, sometimes on a daily basis. If an area is no longer on the list, Petersen says it’s considered safe to travel. Currently, the CDC recommends that if a pregnant woman or her partner travel to an area with Zika, the couple should use condoms every time they have sex or avoid sex for the rest of the pregnancy, even if they do not have symptoms of Zika.

View Sample    Sign Up Now     Should women who plan to get pregnant avoid traveling to places with Zika?  Women who are planning to get pregnant, and their partners, should also pay attention to where they are traveling. The first trimester, during which women may not know they are pregnant, appears to be the most risky time when it comes to Zika-related health complications for infants down the line.    The CDC recommends that women who travel to areas with Zika who want to get pregnant in the near future wait at least eight weeks after their last possible exposure to the virus before trying to conceive. For male partners, the CDC advises waiting six months after the last possible exposure before trying to conceive. Using condoms is also recommended for the waiting period.  What if I am invited to a destination wedding in a place with Zika? Should I not go?  It may be challenging to get a firm yes or no from your doctor about whether or not you should travel for a major event, though the recommendations are not to go to places with active Zika transmission if you’re pregnant or want to be soon. “My job is to give guidance; I never tell people what to do,” says Dr. Richard Beigi, the chief medical officer of the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “But I think the travel warnings are there for a reason, and nothing has changed from last year other than the fact that we have more information that has validated that Zika causes congenital health problems. The overall risk is the same.”      Deciding to travel despite the risk is ultimately a personal decision. “I ask my patients, ‘Do you really need to go?’ For some people, the answer to that is yes, and that’s fine, and I give them the best advice I can,” Beigi says.  Should I worry about traveling to places that have the types of mosquitoes that can spread Zika?  The CDC recently reported that the types of mosquito that carry Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , are appearing in more counties in the southern U.S. where they haven’t been before. But unless the mosquitoes are transmitting Zika, there’s a “very, very, very low risk,” Petersen says. “In all of the places where we have this kind of mosquito that can spread Zika virus, we also see the kinds of mosquitoes that can spread West Nile and other diseases,” says Petersen. “General mosquito precautions in the summer are important for everybody—not only pregnant women.”      How likely is it that I will get Zika?  Experts can’t give a definitive answer to a person’s chances of getting Zika if they travel to a place that has reported spread of the disease. But experts are getting closer to understanding the likelihood of adverse events should a pregnant woman get infected.  A recent study found that one in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. with a Zika infection had a baby with brain damage or other serious birth defects. The first trimester was the most critical time: 15% of women with confirmed Zika infection in the first trimester had babies with birth defects. Another study found similar numbers for women in U.S. territories, revealing that during their first trimester, nearly 1 in 12 had a baby or fetus with Zika-associated birth defects.      “Out of the data collected, it appears that 5-10% of the time a woman gets Zika during her pregnancy, there will be in impact,” says Beigi. “Most of the impact is a malfunction; some of it is miscarriage. Probably the absolute risk of you having a problem is not very big, but it’s not zero, and it’s hard to know.”  How bad will Zika get in the U.S. this summer?  It’s unclear how many cases of Zika will be expected in and outside the U.S. this summer, though experts say it could be lower than last year. “Based on historical evidence, we would expect that outbreaks this year throughout the Western Hemisphere are going to be less than they were the year before,” says Petersen. “It’s not going away, but since a lot of people have already been infected and are no longer susceptible to infection, it will lower the number of cases over time.”  So far in 2017, about 650 Americans have gotten Zika, though that it is considered an underestimate. Most people do not experience symptoms and will not know they have the virus.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

Which insect repellents work best to prevent infections caused by mosquito bites? How should insect repellents be used on children to prevent mosquito bites and the viruses that some mosquitoes can spread? Is it safe for infants or children to travel to an area with risk of Zika? What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika? Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States? What is CDC doing about Zika?      Q: What is Zika?  A: Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus, which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting up to a week, and many people do not have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: How do people get infected with Zika?  A: Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). A pregnant woman can pass Zika to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Also, a person with Zika can pass it to his or her sex partners. We encourage people who have traveled to or live in places with risk of Zika to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What health problems can result from getting Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika will have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last several days to a week. However, Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Current research suggests that Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) , an uncommon sickness of the nervous system, is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS.  Once someone has been infected with Zika, it’s very likely they’ll be protected from future infections. There is no evidence that past Zika infection poses an increased risk of birth defects in future pregnancies.     Q: Should pregnant women travel to areas with risk of Zika ?  A: No. Pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika . Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and Zika infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: If I am traveling to an area with risk of Zika, should I be concerned about Zika?  A: Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and CDC has issued travel recommendations for people traveling to areas with a CDC Zika Travel Notice. Many people will have mild or no symptoms. However, Zika can cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects. For this reason, pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika , and women trying to get pregnant should talk to their doctors before traveling or before their sex partners travel to an area with risk of Zika . It is especially important that women who wish to delay or avoid pregnancy consistently use the most effective method of birth control that they are able to use. Those traveling to areas with risk of Zika should take steps during and after they travel to prevent mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What can people do to prevent Zika?  A: The best way to prevent Zika is to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites:  Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents  Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.  Zika can be spread by a person infected with Zika to his or her sex partners. Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex. Condoms include male and female condoms. To be effective, condoms should be used from start to finish, every time during vaginal, anal, and oral sex and the sharing of sex toys. Not having sex eliminates the risk of getting Zika from sex. Pregnant couples with a partner who traveled to or lives in an area with risk of Zika should use condoms every time they have sex or not have sex during the pregnancy.     Q: What are the symptoms of Zika virus disease?  A: The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika won’t have symptoms or will have mild symptoms, which can last for several days to a week.     Q: How is Zika diagnosed?  A: To diagnose Zika, your doctor will ask you about recent travel and symptoms you may have, and collect blood or urine to test for Zika or similar viruses.     Q: Can someone who returned from an area with risk of Zika get tested for the virus?  A: Zika virus testing is performed at CDC and some state and territorial health departments. See your doctor if you have Zika symptoms and have recently been in an area with risk of Zika . Your doctor may order tests to look for Zika or similar viruses like dengue and chikungunya.     Q: What should pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika do?  A: Pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika should talk to their doctor about their travel, even if they don’t feel sick. Pregnant women should see a doctor if they have any Zika symptoms during their trip or after traveling. All pregnant women can protect themselves by avoiding travel to an area with risk of Zika, preventing mosquito bites , and following recommended precautions against getting Zika through sex .     Q: I am not pregnant, but will my future pregnancies be at risk if I am infected with Zika virus?  A: Currently, there is no evidence that a woman who has recovered from Zika virus infection (the virus has cleared her body) will have Zika-related pregnancy complications in the future. Based on information about similar infections, once a person has been infected with Zika virus and has cleared the virus from his or her body, he or she is likely to be protected from future Zika infections.  If you’re thinking about having a baby in the near future and you or your partner live in or traveled to an area with risk of Zika , talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider. See Women & Their Partners Trying to Become Pregnant .     Q: I was in a place with risk of Zika recently. How long do I need to wait after returning to get pregnant?  A: Men who have traveled to a place with a CDC Zika travel notice or a red area of Zika active transmission in the United States should wait at least 6 months after travel (or 6 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to conceive with their partner. Women should wait at least 8 weeks after travel (or 8 weeks after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to get pregnant. The waiting period is longer for men because Zika stays in semen longer than in other body fluids. Travelers to areas with risk of Zika but no CDC Zika travel notice should talk to their healthcare provider. Travelers to yellow Zika cautionary areas can consider waiting these timeframes before trying to conceive. If either partner has symptoms of Zika or tests positive for Zika after travel, they should follow the suggested timeframes above before trying to get pregnant.     Q: Which insect repellents work best to prevent infections caused by mosquito bites?  A: To prevent Zika and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents on exposed skin. The insect repellent should include one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. Always follow the label instructions when using insect repellent.     Q: How should insect repellents be used on children to prevent mosquito bites and the viruses that some mosquitoes can spread?  A: You should not use insect repellents on babies younger than 2 months old. Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old. Do not apply insect repellent onto a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin. Adults should spray insect repellent onto their hands and then apply to a child’s face. Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.     Q: Is it safe for infants or children to travel to an area with risk of Zika?  A: CDC’s travel guidance for areas with risk of Zika applies to infants and children, as well as adults. CDC recommends that those who travel to areas with risk of Zika protect themselves from mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning from travel. For safe and effective ways to protect your child from mosquito bites, please visit CDC’s Zika prevention page . Most children infected with Zika virus have no symptoms or have a mild illness, similar to adults with Zika virus infection.     Q: What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms lasting several days to a week. If you have symptoms of Zika (fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain) and you live in or recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika , you should see your doctor or healthcare provider and tell him or her about your symptoms and recent travel. There is no specific medicine for Zika, but you can treat the symptoms . If you are diagnosed with Zika, protect those around you by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites and to prevent sexual transmission of Zika. Because Zika can generally be found in blood during approximately the first week of infection and can be passed to another person through mosquito bites, help prevent others from getting sick by strictly following steps to prevent mosquito bites during the first week of illness.     Q: Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States?  A: Local mosquito-borne spread of Zika has been reported in the continental United States. CDC has guidance for people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County, Florida , and Brownsville, Texas .  Many areas in the United States have the type of mosquitoes that can become infected with and spread Zika virus. Everyone can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, staying in places with air conditioning and window and door screens, treating clothing and gear with permethrin, and using EPA-registered insect repellents that contain one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone.     Q: What is CDC doing about Zika?  A: CDC is working around the clock to respond to the Zika virus outbreak. CDC’s work includes developing laboratory tests to diagnose Zika, conducting studies to learn more about Zika, publishing reports about Zika, monitoring and reporting cases of Zika, providing guidance to travelers and Americans living in areas with outbreaks, providing on-the-ground support in countries and US territories with current Zika outbreaks, and more.

Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. Always follow the label instructions when using insect repellent.     Q: How should insect repellents be used on children to prevent mosquito bites and the viruses that some mosquitoes can spread?  A: You should not use insect repellents on babies younger than 2 months old. Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old. Do not apply insect repellent onto a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin. Adults should spray insect repellent onto their hands and then apply to a child’s face. Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.     Q: Is it safe for infants or children to travel to an area with risk of Zika?  A: CDC’s travel guidance for areas with risk of Zika applies to infants and children, as well as adults. CDC recommends that those who travel to areas with risk of Zika protect themselves from mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning from travel. For safe and effective ways to protect your child from mosquito bites, please visit CDC’s Zika prevention page . Most children infected with Zika virus have no symptoms or have a mild illness, similar to adults with Zika virus infection.     Q: What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms lasting several days to a week. If you have symptoms of Zika (fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain) and you live in or recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika , you should see your doctor or healthcare provider and tell him or her about your symptoms and recent travel. There is no specific medicine for Zika, but you can treat the symptoms . If you are diagnosed with Zika, protect those around you by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites and to prevent sexual transmission of Zika. Because Zika can generally be found in blood during approximately the first week of infection and can be passed to another person through mosquito bites, help prevent others from getting sick by strictly following steps to prevent mosquito bites during the first week of illness.     Q: Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States?  A: Local mosquito-borne spread of Zika has been reported in the continental United States. CDC has guidance for people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County, Florida , and Brownsville, Texas .  Many areas in the United States have the type of mosquitoes that can become infected with and spread Zika virus. Everyone can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, staying in places with air conditioning and window and door screens, treating clothing and gear with permethrin, and using EPA-registered insect repellents that contain one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone.     Q: What is CDC doing about Zika?  A: CDC is working around the clock to respond to the Zika virus outbreak. CDC’s work includes developing laboratory tests to diagnose Zika, conducting studies to learn more about Zika, publishing reports about Zika, monitoring and reporting cases of Zika, providing guidance to travelers and Americans living in areas with outbreaks, providing on-the-ground support in countries and US territories with current Zika outbreaks, and more.

What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika? Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States? What is CDC doing about Zika?      Q: What is Zika?  A: Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus, which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting up to a week, and many people do not have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: How do people get infected with Zika?  A: Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). A pregnant woman can pass Zika to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Also, a person with Zika can pass it to his or her sex partners. We encourage people who have traveled to or live in places with risk of Zika to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What health problems can result from getting Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika will have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last several days to a week. However, Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Current research suggests that Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) , an uncommon sickness of the nervous system, is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS.  Once someone has been infected with Zika, it’s very likely they’ll be protected from future infections. There is no evidence that past Zika infection poses an increased risk of birth defects in future pregnancies.     Q: Should pregnant women travel to areas with risk of Zika ?  A: No. Pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika . Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and Zika infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: If I am traveling to an area with risk of Zika, should I be concerned about Zika?  A: Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and CDC has issued travel recommendations for people traveling to areas with a CDC Zika Travel Notice. Many people will have mild or no symptoms. However, Zika can cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects. For this reason, pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika , and women trying to get pregnant should talk to their doctors before traveling or before their sex partners travel to an area with risk of Zika . It is especially important that women who wish to delay or avoid pregnancy consistently use the most effective method of birth control that they are able to use. Those traveling to areas with risk of Zika should take steps during and after they travel to prevent mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What can people do to prevent Zika?  A: The best way to prevent Zika is to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites:  Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents  Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.  Zika can be spread by a person infected with Zika to his or her sex partners. Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex. Condoms include male and female condoms. To be effective, condoms should be used from start to finish, every time during vaginal, anal, and oral sex and the sharing of sex toys. Not having sex eliminates the risk of getting Zika from sex. Pregnant couples with a partner who traveled to or lives in an area with risk of Zika should use condoms every time they have sex or not have sex during the pregnancy.     Q: What are the symptoms of Zika virus disease?  A: The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika won’t have symptoms or will have mild symptoms, which can last for several days to a week.     Q: How is Zika diagnosed?  A: To diagnose Zika, your doctor will ask you about recent travel and symptoms you may have, and collect blood or urine to test for Zika or similar viruses.     Q: Can someone who returned from an area with risk of Zika get tested for the virus?  A: Zika virus testing is performed at CDC and some state and territorial health departments. See your doctor if you have Zika symptoms and have recently been in an area with risk of Zika . Your doctor may order tests to look for Zika or similar viruses like dengue and chikungunya.     Q: What should pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika do?  A: Pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika should talk to their doctor about their travel, even if they don’t feel sick. Pregnant women should see a doctor if they have any Zika symptoms during their trip or after traveling. All pregnant women can protect themselves by avoiding travel to an area with risk of Zika, preventing mosquito bites , and following recommended precautions against getting Zika through sex .     Q: I am not pregnant, but will my future pregnancies be at risk if I am infected with Zika virus?  A: Currently, there is no evidence that a woman who has recovered from Zika virus infection (the virus has cleared her body) will have Zika-related pregnancy complications in the future. Based on information about similar infections, once a person has been infected with Zika virus and has cleared the virus from his or her body, he or she is likely to be protected from future Zika infections.  If you’re thinking about having a baby in the near future and you or your partner live in or traveled to an area with risk of Zika , talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider. See Women & Their Partners Trying to Become Pregnant .     Q: I was in a place with risk of Zika recently. How long do I need to wait after returning to get pregnant?  A: Men who have traveled to a place with a CDC Zika travel notice or a red area of Zika active transmission in the United States should wait at least 6 months after travel (or 6 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to conceive with their partner. Women should wait at least 8 weeks after travel (or 8 weeks after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to get pregnant. The waiting period is longer for men because Zika stays in semen longer than in other body fluids. Travelers to areas with risk of Zika but no CDC Zika travel notice should talk to their healthcare provider. Travelers to yellow Zika cautionary areas can consider waiting these timeframes before trying to conceive. If either partner has symptoms of Zika or tests positive for Zika after travel, they should follow the suggested timeframes above before trying to get pregnant.     Q: Which insect repellents work best to prevent infections caused by mosquito bites?  A: To prevent Zika and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents on exposed skin. The insect repellent should include one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone.

A: Men who have traveled to a place with a CDC Zika travel notice or a red area of Zika active transmission in the United States should wait at least 6 months after travel (or 6 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to conceive with their partner. Women should wait at least 8 weeks after travel (or 8 weeks after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to get pregnant. The waiting period is longer for men because Zika stays in semen longer than in other body fluids. Travelers to areas with risk of Zika but no CDC Zika travel notice should talk to their healthcare provider. Travelers to yellow Zika cautionary areas can consider waiting these timeframes before trying to conceive. If either partner has symptoms of Zika or tests positive for Zika after travel, they should follow the suggested timeframes above before trying to get pregnant.     Q: Which insect repellents work best to prevent infections caused by mosquito bites?  A: To prevent Zika and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents on exposed skin. The insect repellent should include one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. Always follow the label instructions when using insect repellent.     Q: How should insect repellents be used on children to prevent mosquito bites and the viruses that some mosquitoes can spread?  A: You should not use insect repellents on babies younger than 2 months old. Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old. Do not apply insect repellent onto a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin. Adults should spray insect repellent onto their hands and then apply to a child’s face. Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.     Q: Is it safe for infants or children to travel to an area with risk of Zika?  A: CDC’s travel guidance for areas with risk of Zika applies to infants and children, as well as adults. CDC recommends that those who travel to areas with risk of Zika protect themselves from mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning from travel. For safe and effective ways to protect your child from mosquito bites, please visit CDC’s Zika prevention page . Most children infected with Zika virus have no symptoms or have a mild illness, similar to adults with Zika virus infection.     Q: What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms lasting several days to a week. If you have symptoms of Zika (fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain) and you live in or recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika , you should see your doctor or healthcare provider and tell him or her about your symptoms and recent travel. There is no specific medicine for Zika, but you can treat the symptoms . If you are diagnosed with Zika, protect those around you by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites and to prevent sexual transmission of Zika. Because Zika can generally be found in blood during approximately the first week of infection and can be passed to another person through mosquito bites, help prevent others from getting sick by strictly following steps to prevent mosquito bites during the first week of illness.     Q: Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States?  A: Local mosquito-borne spread of Zika has been reported in the continental United States. CDC has guidance for people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County, Florida , and Brownsville, Texas .  Many areas in the United States have the type of mosquitoes that can become infected with and spread Zika virus. Everyone can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, staying in places with air conditioning and window and door screens, treating clothing and gear with permethrin, and using EPA-registered insect repellents that contain one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone.     Q: What is CDC doing about Zika?  A: CDC is working around the clock to respond to the Zika virus outbreak. CDC’s work includes developing laboratory tests to diagnose Zika, conducting studies to learn more about Zika, publishing reports about Zika, monitoring and reporting cases of Zika, providing guidance to travelers and Americans living in areas with outbreaks, providing on-the-ground support in countries and US territories with current Zika outbreaks, and more.

What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika? Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States? What is CDC doing about Zika?      Q: What is Zika?  A: Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus, which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting up to a week, and many people do not have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: How do people get infected with Zika?  A: Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). A pregnant woman can pass Zika to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Also, a person with Zika can pass it to his or her sex partners. We encourage people who have traveled to or live in places with risk of Zika to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What health problems can result from getting Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika will have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last several days to a week. However, Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Current research suggests that Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) , an uncommon sickness of the nervous system, is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS.  Once someone has been infected with Zika, it’s very likely they’ll be protected from future infections. There is no evidence that past Zika infection poses an increased risk of birth defects in future pregnancies.     Q: Should pregnant women travel to areas with risk of Zika ?  A: No. Pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika . Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and Zika infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: If I am traveling to an area with risk of Zika, should I be concerned about Zika?  A: Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and CDC has issued travel recommendations for people traveling to areas with a CDC Zika Travel Notice. Many people will have mild or no symptoms. However, Zika can cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects. For this reason, pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika , and women trying to get pregnant should talk to their doctors before traveling or before their sex partners travel to an area with risk of Zika . It is especially important that women who wish to delay or avoid pregnancy consistently use the most effective method of birth control that they are able to use. Those traveling to areas with risk of Zika should take steps during and after they travel to prevent mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What can people do to prevent Zika?  A: The best way to prevent Zika is to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites:  Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents  Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.  Zika can be spread by a person infected with Zika to his or her sex partners. Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex. Condoms include male and female condoms. To be effective, condoms should be used from start to finish, every time during vaginal, anal, and oral sex and the sharing of sex toys. Not having sex eliminates the risk of getting Zika from sex. Pregnant couples with a partner who traveled to or lives in an area with risk of Zika should use condoms every time they have sex or not have sex during the pregnancy.     Q: What are the symptoms of Zika virus disease?  A: The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika won’t have symptoms or will have mild symptoms, which can last for several days to a week.     Q: How is Zika diagnosed?  A: To diagnose Zika, your doctor will ask you about recent travel and symptoms you may have, and collect blood or urine to test for Zika or similar viruses.     Q: Can someone who returned from an area with risk of Zika get tested for the virus?  A: Zika virus testing is performed at CDC and some state and territorial health departments. See your doctor if you have Zika symptoms and have recently been in an area with risk of Zika . Your doctor may order tests to look for Zika or similar viruses like dengue and chikungunya.     Q: What should pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika do?  A: Pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika should talk to their doctor about their travel, even if they don’t feel sick. Pregnant women should see a doctor if they have any Zika symptoms during their trip or after traveling. All pregnant women can protect themselves by avoiding travel to an area with risk of Zika, preventing mosquito bites , and following recommended precautions against getting Zika through sex .     Q: I am not pregnant, but will my future pregnancies be at risk if I am infected with Zika virus?  A: Currently, there is no evidence that a woman who has recovered from Zika virus infection (the virus has cleared her body) will have Zika-related pregnancy complications in the future. Based on information about similar infections, once a person has been infected with Zika virus and has cleared the virus from his or her body, he or she is likely to be protected from future Zika infections.  If you’re thinking about having a baby in the near future and you or your partner live in or traveled to an area with risk of Zika , talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider. See Women & Their Partners Trying to Become Pregnant .     Q: I was in a place with risk of Zika recently. How long do I need to wait after returning to get pregnant?  A: Men who have traveled to a place with a CDC Zika travel notice or a red area of Zika active transmission in the United States should wait at least 6 months after travel (or 6 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to conceive with their partner. Women should wait at least 8 weeks after travel (or 8 weeks after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to get pregnant.

Hide Caption 29 of 29 Story highlights Only 1 in 5 people will develop any symptoms; symptoms are typically mild and temporary There is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection (CNN) The Zika virus was discovered nearly 70 years ago, but chances are you probably hadn't heard of it until the past few months. With fear and uncertainty spreading as quickly as the virus itself, CNN Health wanted to address some of your pressing questions on the topic. To stay informed on the latest Zika news and most up-to-date information, bookmark: CNN.com/Zika . Should I be worried about Zika? The Zika virus is part of the same family as yellow fever , West Nile , chikungunya and dengue . But there is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection. Read More Even though symptoms are most often mild, Zika is commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly , a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. It causes severe developmental issues and, in some cases, can result in death. What are the chances I'll get the Zika virus? The virus is most commonly transmitted when an Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a person with an active infection and then spreads the virus by biting others. Originally discovered in a Ugandan forest, the aggressive mosquito is now predominantly raising concerns in Central and South America. If there are no infected mosquitoes in your area, you're very unlikely to contract the disease. Zika has been sexually transmitted in Texas, CDC confirms On February 2, the CDC confirmed the first case of sexually transmitted Zika in the latest outbreak. A male patient who had recently returned from Venezuela infected with Zika returned to the United States and infected his sexual partner, who had not traveled. The CDC issued interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus and noted that "there have been no reports of sexual transmission of Zika virus from infected women to their sex partners." "Until we know more, if your male sexual partner has traveled to or lives in an area with active Zika virus transmission, you should abstain from sex or use condoms the right way every time you have vaginal, anal and oral sex for the duration of the pregnancy," the updated guidance says. CDC issues new safe-sex guidelines around Zika virus While the virus has been documented in breast milk, saliva and urine, it has not yet been confirmed if the virus can be transmitted through any bodily fluids other than blood. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta , "There have been isolated cases of spread through blood transfusion or sexual contact and that's not very surprising. The virus is in the blood for about a week. How long it would remain in the semen is something that needs to be studied and we're working on that now." Frieden said that studies on sexual transmission are not easy studies to do, but the CDC is continuing to explore that avenue of transmission. "What we know is the vast majority of spread is going to be from mosquitoes," Frieden said. "The bottom line is mosquitoes are the real culprit here." What are the symptoms and effects? Only about one in five people infected with Zika virus will actually become ill, according to the CDC . "The most common symptoms of Zika are fever are rash, joint pain or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other symptoms include muscle pain and headache," the CDC says. For most people, the illness is mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. People don't usually get sick enough to require a hospital visit, and the virus very rarely results in death. JUST WATCHED What is the Zika virus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the Zika virus?  01:32 More seriously, Zika has been linked the birth defect microcephaly, as well as Guillain-Barré , a rare syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves. It's important to note: a link does not necessarily indicate cause and effect. Aside from either of these conditions, there are no lasting, long-term effects of Zika. Additionally, once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections, according to the CDC. What should I do if I think I've been exposed? If you think you may have been exposed to the Zika virus, stop and ask yourself these three questions: 1. Are you pregnant? 2. Are you a woman who is thinking about getting pregnant? 3. Are you a man who is going to have unprotected sex with a woman who is pregnant or may become pregnant? If your answer to all of these questions is "no," there is arguably no reason for you to get tested. Remember, only 20% people who contract the virus will even develop any symptoms, and those who do will experience only mild and short-lived discomfort. If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, however, you should contact your doctor about being tested for Zika. He or she can order blood tests to look for Zika or other similar viral diseases, such as dengue or chikungunya. A blood test performed in a clinical setting is the only way to be definitively diagnosed. How I can I be treated if I have the Zika virus? Unfortunately, as of now, there is no vaccine or specific medicine to treat Zika virus infections. Instead, the CDC recommends treating the symptoms: -- Get plenty of rest. -- Drink fluids to prevent dehydration. -- Take medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce fever and pain. -- Do not take aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If you are taking medicine for another medical condition, talk to your health care provider before taking additional medication. How can I keep myself safe in the U.S. or abroad? How to keep away mosquitoes carrying Zika, dengue With no vaccine available, the only protection against Zika is to avoid traveling to areas with an active infestation. If you do travel to a country where Zika is present, the CDC advises strict adherence to mosquito protection measures: Use an EPA-approved repellent over sunscreen, wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts thick enough to block a mosquito bite, and sleep in an air-conditioned, screened room. If you have Zika, you can keep from spreading it to others by avoiding mosquito bites during the first week of illness, the CDC said. The female Aedes aegypti, the primary carrier of Zika, is an aggressive biter, preferring daytime to dusk and indoors to outdoors. Keeping screens on windows and doors is critical to preventing entry to homes and hotel rooms.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She added, “We’ve become more concerned” about the period around the time of conception. “For people who either have the Zika disease or who travel to an area with active Zika transmission, we are now recommending they wait a period of time before trying to get pregnant.”     Zika Virus Rumors and Theories That You Should Doubt  Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.             For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

SUBSCRIBE At least 10 percent of babies born to women infected with Zika virus have been diagnosed with visible birth defects, federal researchers reported Tuesday. And 15 percent of women infected during the first trimester of pregnancy end up with affected babies, the team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE In Texas, Pregnant and Scared of Zika 02:32 That’s just visible defects. Some of the babies may have subtler birth defects that will only be seen as they grow, the CDC team said. It’s the latest and most complete look at the risk that Zika poses to pregnant women and their babies, and it shows the risk is high. “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States,” CDC acting director Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters. So far, 1,600 women infected with Zika are or have been pregnant in the 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. Related: Zika Raises Birth Defect Rate 20 Times “We do know this devastating outbreak is far from over and the consequences of this outbreak are heartbreaking.” More than 1,000 pregnant women who tested positive for Zika virus or had suspected Zika infections either gave birth, had a miscarriage or an abortion in 2016. The CDC team and state health officials took a detailed look at the cases. “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States." “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States." Of all the women, 51 of the women or 5 percent had a baby with some sort of Zika-related birth defect, ranging from microcephaly — the small head that’s the hallmark of Zika and that’s caused by brain damage — to other brain damage or neurological birth defect. Among women whose Zika was confirmed by lab test, 10 percent had a baby or fetus with a Zika-related birth defect. “That proportion increased to 15 percent for women with confirmed Zika during their first trimester,” Schuchat said. The last estimate showed 6 percent of babies or fetuses were affected. That’s probably not the full range of damage, Schuchat added. “Some seemingly healthy babies born following pregnancies complicated by Zika may have developmental problems that become evident months after birth,” she said. Zika is known to cause a range of birth defects . The first to be noticed was microcephaly, but now doctors have seen other profound defects, such as collapsed skulls and other deformities, as well as milder problems, such as eye defects. Related:  Zika-Affected Babies Can Cry 24 Hours a Day “Some babies may have seizures while other babies may have problems controlling their arms and legs,” Schuchat said. “Some babies cry constantly and are inconsolable no matter what their caregiver does,” she added. Others have trouble swallowing or controlling their arms and legs. It could cost $4 million or more to care for a Zika-affected child, the CDC estimates. Zika is mostly carried by travelers to the United States, but the virus has been spread in Florida by local mosquitoes, and there have been a few home-grown cases in south Texas, as well. Any place that has the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika could see local outbreaks. Before Zika, the birth defect rate in the U.S. was about 2.9 per 1,000 live births. “The initial findings from the U.S. Zika virus pregnancy registry represent an approximate twentyfold increase in Zika virus–associated birth defects among pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection, with an approximate thirtyfold increase in brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly,” the CDC and state researchers wrote in their report. “Every mosquito bite carries a risk." “Every mosquito bite carries a risk." Pregnant women or women who could become pregnant should stay away from any place where Zika is spreading, the CDC and World Health Organization says. If they cannot stay away, they should use insect repellent, clothing and other measures to prevent mosquito bites, and condoms to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. Related: Study to Track 10,000 Pregnant Women And pregnant women with any chance of Zika infection need regular scans to see if their baby is affected — and any babies born need an ultrasound or CT scan to check for birth defects. Only 25 percent of the women whose babies were affected got those scans, the CDC said. It’s not clear why not — it could be a health insurance issue — Schuchat said the CDC also believes that all doctors still do not understand the need for such scans. “These findings underscore the serious risk for birth defects posed by Zika virus infection during pregnancy and highlight why pregnant women should avoid Zika virus exposure and that all pregnant women should be screened for possible Zika virus exposure at every prenatal visit,” the CDC team, led by Dr. Margaret Honein, wrote. “Zika is still with us. We don’t know how much transmission there will be this year,” Schuchat said. “Every mosquito bite carries a risk,” she added. “We cannot afford to be complacent when a single bite from a Zika-affected mosquito can lead to such a devastating condition.” Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Why? A sudden surge in Brazilian babies born with microcephaly – a birth defect caused by the Zika infection during pregnancy – sparked massive concern and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a public health emergency. The disease is also linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis.  But there’s an added twist that makes this situation even more complex: Brazil, the country at the center of the current Zika crisis, is slated to host nearly 500,000 visitors this summer. Media attention on the problem has exploded, and experts are even debating whether visitors and athletes should make the trip.  At Casino.org, we’re very familiar with odds – so we decided to calculate the likelihood of the average person contracting Zika this summer in Rio. How does the risk of Zika compare with the risk of other illnesses and accidents? What percentage of the U.S. population currently has the disease? And what are the real odds of catching Zika in Rio this summer? Is the Zika/Rio debate truly a global health crisis – or a case of media hype? Read on to get the full story.    What Do You Have a Greater Chance of Dying From?  So you’ve booked your flight to Rio, and planned your accommodations. What’s the likelihood that you’ll make it back home without catching Zika? Pretty decent: 99.999996 percent.   Another way to gain perspective is to compare your 0.000004 percent chance of contracting Zika in Rio this summer with the odds of dying from various other conditions. Only one person has died in the continental U.S. from Zika as of July 11. You are more than twice as likely to die from legal execution, 73 times more likely to die from choking on food, and over 2,212 times more likely to die in an automobile crash than to even contract Zika in Rio.     How Many Times More Likely Is ...  Should you head to Brazil this summer, you can rest easy when it comes to worrying about Zika: You only have a 1 in 250,000 chance of contracting the virus. By our reckoning, you have a lot more to worry about before you stress about that.   You're thousands of times more likely to die from an auto accident than you are likely to contract Zika in Rio. You’re also hundreds of times more likely to die from a shooting or drowning. Even the most random fatal accidents are more probable: Falling, air accidents, and even lightning strikes should worry you more than contracting Zika.     Zika Infections Across the Country  Zika is making headlines across the United States and around the globe – so we took a look at actual known cases of the virus among people within the United States . First of all, every known case of Zika in the U.S. is associated with travel to an outbreak area or sex with an infected person – there are no known cases of Zika caused by a mosquito bite on American soil as of July 11.  Washington, D.C., tops the list for highest percentage of Zika cases: 0.000893 percent of the population has contracted the disease. New York, Hawaii, and Florida have the next highest rates. In five states – Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, and Alaska – there are no known cases of Zika at all.     Comparing Zika With Ebola, Malaria, and Other Diseases  Zika is constantly being discussed in the media, but how does it compare to other buzzed-about diseases? In the past decade, Ebola, malaria, and the West Nile virus have had just as much media coverage. In 2014, the United States was in an Ebola panic , and many were afraid they would contract Ebola.   While it’s 53 times more likely a resident of the United States will contract Zika over Ebola, those odds were during Ebola’s peak in 2014 and the Zika odds require a trip to Rio this summer. Here in the U.S., your odds of contracting Ebola and Zika are slim, and you are much more likely of contracting a severe form of West Nile disease or even malaria. Your best bet? Wear bug spray and see a doctor if you display any symptoms.    Contracting Zika or Dengue Fever in Rio  As we’ve discovered, the likelihood of contracting Zika this summer isn’t particularly high. It’s much more likely you’d catch a cold or some other common illness from someone beside you in the stands. But what about another mosquito-borne disease?  Dengue fever is a major risk for people who reside in the tropics and subtropics. It is a leading cause of illness and even death in those regions. No vaccine exists, so the best protection is to simply avoid mosquito bites.   Of the nearly half a million projected visitors to Rio this summer, odds are that only two may contract Zika. On the other hand, chances are that about 279 Rio visitors could contract dengue fever.     What Else Is More Likely?  Asteroids. UFOs. Four-leaf clovers. They’re the stuff of dreams – or in some cases, nightmares. But, amazingly, you’re likelier to encounter one of these than you are to become a victim of Zika. For instance, a person is 25 times likelier to find a four-leaf clover on their first try than to contract Zika in Rio this summer.   In addition, a woman in the United States is 8 times more likely to spot a UFO than to give birth to a baby with microcephaly as a result of Zika contracted in Rio.    Calculating the Odds  As you can see, the odds of contracting Zika in Rio this summer are astronomically slim. However, the debate rages on .   Zika is a serious disease, and even one case is a case too many. However, of those who become infected, 8 in 10 don’t even display symptoms, and the remaining 2 in 10 usually aren’t ill enough to require medical treatment. Zika’s greatest danger, by far, is to pregnant women.  It’s always important to do the research, weigh the risks, and calculate the odds.

For women living in areas where the mosquito-borne virus is spreading, who are trying to make the huge decision of whether, and when, to have a child, there’s not a lot to go on. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women who’ve gotten Zika should wait at least eight weeks to conceive, and that men who’ve gotten it should wait at least six months. But the vast majority of people who are infected with Zika don’t show any symptoms, and children can still be born with birth defects and mothers can still miscarry, even if they never had symptoms. So it’s possible that microcephaly—a birth defect caused by Zika that leads to smaller-than-average head size and other developmental problems—could sneak up on parents who never knew one of them had Zika in the first place. Margaret Chan, the director of the World Health Organization, summed up the harsh reality of the situation in her recent address to the 69th World Health Assembly : “To protect women of childbearing age, all we can offer is advice. Avoid mosquito bites. Delay pregnancy. Do not travel to areas with ongoing transmission.” If a woman is infected in her first trimester, there is between a 1 and 13 percent chance of her fetus developing microcephaly. This is not the most reassuring advice. But a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates how likely it is that the fetus of a woman infected with Zika would develop microcephaly, offering would-be parents at least some idea of the risk they’d be taking on. Analyzing current outbreak data from the Brazilian state of Bahia, researchers from the CDC calculated that if a woman is infected in her first trimester, there is between a 1  and 13 percent chance of her fetus developing microcephaly. Related Stories      Zika Is a Delayed Epidemic   When in Pregnancy Is Zika Most Dangerous?   The Count of American Zika Cases Just Got Bigger   That’s a big range! We have Zika’s stealthy nature to thank for that. The first number is based on the assumption that the Zika infection rate in Bahia’s population is 80 percent and that half the cases of microcephaly reported are false. The second presumes a 10 percent infection rate and that every case reported is true. There’s probably been at least some overreporting of microcephaly in Brazil, and since many people don’t show symptoms and don’t get tested, the actual infection rate is hard to pin down. So we don’t know where in that range the truth lies. A previous analysis of the 2013-2014 Zika outbreak in French Polynesia found about a 1 percent risk—but the microcephaly cases there were found retrospectively, so that might be on the low side. Some important caveats—this study only looked at first-trimester infection, and infection at all stages of pregnancy has been associated with fetal abnormalities and other pregnancy problems. And it also only looked at microcephaly specifically. “Microcephaly is only one possible adverse outcome among a spectrum of conditions that may be part of congenital Zika syndrome,” the researchers write. Still, at least we now have a risk estimate to offer women, along with advice.

Emily Buder   2:23 PM ET      About the Author      Julie Beck is a senior associate editor at The Atlantic , where she covers health and psychology.   Twitter                 Most Popular  Presented by               Jonathan Ernst / Reuters   Michael Cohen Has a Big Problem    Adam Serwer    It takes strong evidence to execute a search warrant against an attorney representing a subject in a federal investigation, let alone the president’s personal counsel.   Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.   Continue Reading                Alana Semuels / The Atlantic   A House You Can Buy, But Never Own    Alana Semuels      African Americans in the same neighborhoods decimated by subprime lending are now being targeted with new predatory loan offerings, a lawsuit argues.   ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

Robinson Meyer      How to find out if you are one of the 87 million victims   Facebook has begun to notify users who were affected by the Cambridge Analytica data breach. If you or one of your friends installed the personality-quiz app “This Is Your Digital Life” prior to 2015, then some of your data illicitly made it to the servers of the voter-profiling company.  If your data was ensnared in the breach, you’re not alone. I’m also one of Cambridge Analytica’s victims. (If you’re not sure whether you were affected, you can go to this Facebook page , which will tell you if your information was shared.)  I know I was affected by the breach because I saw a big text box when I opened the Facebook app on my phone this morning.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.

Madrigal      Inside Uber’s latest attempt to rebuild its app for drivers, the biggest experiment in the gig economy.   Every day, the world’s 3 million Uber drivers spend 8.5 million hours logged into the ride-hailing company’s app. That’s roughly 1,000 years of Uber driving packed into any given 24 hours.  Because of this tremendous scale, Uber is the most important test case for the gig economy, the new economic arrangement where contract workers are arranged into a cohesive labor force by software. There are many companies that share Uber’s controversial approach to doling out work, but none has amassed 3 million people who use the service to try to make money. Never before has an app’s design been so important to so many people.  The Uber app is the drivers’ workplace, as much as the city where they’re driving is. Each decision about its interface structures drivers’ interactions with Uber the company as well as Uber the transportation marketplace. And Uber is now putting the finishing touches on a from-scratch rebuild of the driver app.    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

Lourdes Health System    Administration         Your risk of contracting the Zika virus is very, very low. In fact, many people who contract Zika may not even realize it. So far, there is no mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika virus within the United States, so most screening efforts are looking to see if a person has traveled to an area where it is endemic. Zika is contracted by mosquitoes in Puerto Rico and Central and South America. So, doctors are screening for Zika to see if a person or a sexual partner has been in one of these territories. The tricky part is that the incubation time of the virus is between three and seven days. So, you might come back from a vacation or a conference and show no signs yet.

Univ. of Nev. School of Medicine, Family Medicine    Family Medicine         Your chance, or risk, of getting Zika depends on where you live or travel. The Zika virus has been seen in Mexico, Central America, South America, Puerto Rico and on several Caribbean islands. Anyone traveling to these areas may come in contact with the Zika virus. You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites. In the U.S, the Zika virus has so far been found only in limited areas in Florida, although people who have come in contact with the virus elsewhere have returned to country with the infection. (This is called a travel-associated case.)                   Khang N. Tran, MD on behalf of Medical City Plano    Internal Medicine         Only 1 in 5 people bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika will actually get Zika. A person may not become infected -- possibly because their immune system was on overdrive that day, or the amount of the virus carried by the mosquito was very small.

Here’s what you need to know about the Zika virus.  Friday, June 30  A programming note  This will be the final weekly edition of Zika in 30 Seconds. Thank you for reading as, over the last 17 months, we’ve tracked the developing science, the progress toward a vaccine, and the many questions still unanswered about Zika virus.  advertisement        Still, our coverage of Zika will continue. Going forward we’ll use this space to alert you to important news about Zika as it arises — so stay tuned.  And for more regular updates about Zika, follow STAT’s senior writer for global health Helen Branswell on Twitter .  On people’s lips  “The fight against Zika virus is not a 100-m race, but rather a marathon in which science and public health need to work hand in hand for the benefit of our peoples.” — Carissa F. Etienne , director of Pan American Health Organization  What lies ahead  The dramatic global rise of Zika in 2016 was followed by an equally dramatic decline by the end of that year — the reasons for which epidemiologists are still sorting out. But, global health expert Dr. Peter Hotez writes , “While countries such as Brazil no longer seem to be sustaining new transmission, there are new foci popping up in additional Latin American countries, including Ecuador and Peru on the Pacific Coast of South America, as well as in Argentina and Bolivia.”  In the U.S., he says, Florida seems less at risk this year than it was last year, when the state saw more than 200 cases of local Zika transmission.  But, Hotez writes, spread of the virus in Mexico may mean that local cases in Texas crop up later this year.  The bottom line, he says? We’re in a “new normal” for Zika and other similar viruses, both in the U.S. and globally.     Friday, June 23  What’s new this week     The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it would fund a study in Guatemala to determine whether Zika virus is capable of attacking the still-developing brains of newborns. ( STAT )    Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which can carry Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, are more common across the United States than previously believed, federal experts reported. ( NBC News )    The claim that six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, had contracted Zika, was retracted. ( Houston Chronicle )    When seeking a diagnosis    Testing for Zika virus RNA in placental tissue can confirm Zika infection when the mother’s blood tests are inconclusive, according to a new study. The authors emphasize that clinicians should continue to consider testing for Zika RNA when a definitive diagnosis has not been reached. ( Medscape )    Today’s must-read    A clinic mix-up leaves pregnant woman in dark about Zika risk. ( Kaiser Health News )       Friday, June 16  What’s new this week     A group of Florida lawmakers is urging the U.S. Army to hold a hearing on its plan to give Sanofi an exclusive license to develop a Zika virus vaccine, a move that has raised concerns the product may be priced too high for many Americans, even though it was developed with taxpayer funds. ( STAT )    Six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, have tested positive for Zika, the first cases of the mosquito-borne disease to be reported in the area in 2017. ( Houston Chronicle )    Learning the hard way    When Zika struck last year, officials in Miami-Dade County immediately began fogging with permethrin, the active ingredient in home bug-killers such as Raid. Permethrin was sprayed at least seven times, but by the end of August, the county realized the poison had little effect and stopped using it. Officials didn’t get around to testing which pesticides kill Aedes aegypti until October — midway through Zika season. ( Miami New Times )    Today’s must-read    Zika in America: One mother’s saga ( Kaiser Health News )     Friday, June 9  What’s new this week   A new CDC report quantifies Zika’s toll on pregnancies in U.S. territories. Five percent of Zika-affected pregnancies resulted in birth defects, researchers found, and the risk was highest in the first trimester, declining each trimester after ( New York Times )  Health concerns about the pesticide naled — used in Florida and elsewhere to battle Zika — were again raised by a new study. Higher concentrations of naled in the cord blood of Chinese infants was correlated with impaired motor skills at age 9 months ( Miami Herald )   Inside STAT: Fading from view  The public’s sense of alarm over the Zika outbreak has subsided — posing a challenge to health officials who want to keep it on the radar of the people who need to pay attention. Puerto Rico declared its outbreak over this week; Brazil said its emergency was over in May. In the United States, summer approaches with little discussion of the virus outside public health circles. But the risk to pregnant women traveling abroad is still real, and not going to change anytime soon. Read more .  Today’s must-read   A Washington state mother on the challenges of raising a daughter with microcephaly ( Newsworks )    Friday, June 2  What’s new this week   The WHO last Friday announced India’s first three cases of the Zika virus, including two pregnant women — but since then questions have been brewing. More on that below. ( WHO )  A new Discovery Channel documentary about mosquito-borne diseases, slated to air July 6, will feature Jeremy Renner as narrator ( The Hollywood Reporter )  Zika testing in May rose to levels not seen since last August, according to EHR vendor athenahealth ( Healthcare IT News )   India’s Zika silence  In the wake of India’s disclosure last month to the WHO that it had detected three cases of Zika, a number of questions have been raised about why the cases weren’t announced months ago. The Washington Post reports that health ministers said they knew about the country’s first case of Zika back in November of 2016, but they didn’t alert the public because they didn’t want “people to start panicking.” Meanwhile, The Wire points out, the country’s disease surveillance index still says zero cases of Zika have been found in the country, and the WHO has moved India up from the safest category 4 to category 2 in its ranking of Zika risk.  How microcephaly happens  A new paper sheds further light on why the Zika virus takes its most dramatic toll on the developing brain: Because a protein found in those cells helps the virus reproduce. The protein, called Musashi-1, is found in high levels in precursors to neurons — but if Zika virus is present it acts like a sponge, depriving the neurons of the protein. In fact, one family with a congenital mutation in the Musashi-1 gene has two children with microcephaly, the researchers point out, adding further evidence that this protein is key to normal brain development. That discovery may hopefully help scientists devise a way to stop the damage from occurring.  Today’s must-read   US taxpayers are funding a Zika vaccine. Let’s make sure US patients can afford it ( STAT )    Friday, May 26  What’s new this week   Sequencing the genome of Zika virus has indicated that in almost every affected country, Zika was circulating for months — or even years — before the first cases were reported ( The Atlantic )  Though good news for the broader population, a drop in Zika cases in Latin America has made it hard for research studies on the virus to recruit enough participants to have meaningful results ( Nature )  By removing protections for preexisting conditions, the GOP health bill may make insurance prohibitively expensive both for pregnant women who have had Zika and for infants born with microcephaly ( Mother Jones )   Response, in retrospect  The GAO this week released a report on the US government’s response to the Zika epidemic, concluding that the CDC and many states were underprepared to battle the outbreak. The report finds that the federal government could do better specifically on distributing and regulating diagnostic tests and on communicating geographic risk of the virus. The steps that the report concludes that the HHS should take are:   Establish a transparent process to provide CDC diagnostic tests, upon request, to manufacturers that are in the final stages of diagnostic test authorization.  Include information on CDC-developed tests distributed to or shared with public health laboratories on CDC’s website, including laboratory developed tests.  Provide details such as collection records, dates, and data limitations on posted and disseminated mosquito distribution maps to better inform mosquito control experts and the general public.  Consolidate information from individual diagnostic test labels and make this information available in a form that enables users to more readily compare information across tests.  Require manufacturers to list the identity of comparator assays on their diagnostic test labels.   A startling case study  A recently published case study describes an American adolescent who contracted Zika on a trip to the Caribbean. Symptoms of sore throat, headache, rash, and joint pain resolved soon after the individual returned to the US, but a range of worrying psychiatric symptoms — including “excessive energy, decreased sleep, rapid and tangential speech, grandiose thinking, impulsivity, and decreased inhibition” — stuck around for weeks afterward and even necessitated a period of hospitalization. Fifteen weeks after symptom onset, doctors reported, the patient’s symptoms were better but not gone. All told, they write, the case “raise[s] the possibility that Zika virus infection may trigger neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.”  Today’s must-read   ‘I taught them to love Valentina as I do’: Mother’s faith guides struggle to care for daughter with microcephaly ( Milwaukee Journal Sentinel )    Friday, May 19  What’s new this week   Cuba had one of the most successful Zika-reduction campaigns in Latin America last year — but even so, the virus is taking a toll there. Health officials said this week that 1,847 residents have so far contracted the virus, the first such information out of the country in months. It’s unclear how many of those cases were locally transmitted ( Reuters )  Sanofi Pasteur has rejected a request from the US Army to set an affordable US price for a Zika vaccine that the company is developing with American taxpayer funds, prompting an angry response from Senator Bernie Sanders ( STAT )   Fighting cancer with Zika?  Studying Zika’s tragic effects on fetuses has revealed two key qualities of the virus: It can cross the blood-brain barrier, and it specifically targets the developing brain. Now scientists are wondering whether those qualities might make the virus a cancer-killer . A newly funded research project in the UK will examine, in cells and in mice, whether Zika virus can selectively attack and kill brain cancer cells.  A key challenge of delivering drugs to the brain is the blood-brain barrier, which prohibits many molecules from passing into the brain — but Zika appears to be able to pass. What’s more, glioblastoma cells — a highly lethal form of brain cancer — resemble fetal brain cells in a number of ways. Combining those two lines of reasoning, scientists are now embarking on a project to see how Zika interacts with the cancer.   Friday, May 12  What’s new this week   Brazil today declared an end to national emergency status for Zika virus. The number of cases in the country dropped 95 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period a year ago, officials said ( BBC )  In an effort to kill mosquito larvae near homes, residents of one Florida county can get free “mosquito fish” at their local library ( ABC )  The costs, just in the near term, of Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean could be $18 billion, according to a new study. That amount covers just 2015-2017 and it is the upper bound of a wide range of possibilities, depending on rates of transmission ( press release )   Testing advice changes for pregnant women  The CDC is now suggesting that women thinking of getting pregnant, and who may be exposed to the Zika virus, should consider having their blood tested for Zika antibodies before they get pregnant . That’s because IgM, a type of antibody triggered by Zika infection, can stick around in the blood for months, and doctors can’t always tell if the infection happened before pregnancy — which poses no risk to the fetus — or during pregnancy, when it’s a high risk. To distinguish those two scenarios, women at risk of exposure should ideally be tested before pregnancy and again each trimester.   Friday, May 5  What’s new this week   The Prevention and Public Health Fund, which would be eliminated under the health bill that passed the House this week, provides a significant chunk of the CDC’s budget — including funding efforts to fight Zika ( STAT , NASHP )  Miami-Dade County has spent about $25 million on battling Zika so far, officials say ( Miami Herald )   Rift between Puerto Rico and CDC  Of all the states and territories, US health officials last year were especially worried about Zika’s potential impacts in Puerto Rico — which was part of their motivation to create the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System to track pregnant women and identify infants and fetuses with Zika-related birth defects. The CDC awarded Puerto Rico’s Department of Health $9.5 million for the project. But since then the agencies have had a protracted feud, a document obtained by STAT shows, with the CDC claiming that health officials disregarded the established case definition for identifying affected infants — creating the illusion of far fewer affected infants than there may in fact be.

And more than 3,300 pregnant women there are known to have contracted the virus. But the number of babies born in Puerto Rico with microcephaly and other birth defects caused by Zika is unexpectedly low — just 16 cases — which is leading experts to question whether the island territory is downplaying its Zika spread, possibly to protect its tourism industry.   2 more babies have been born in the US with #Zika -induced birth defects. So far 65 pregnancies have been affected.

Researchers found that mice with West Nile or dengue antibodies were much more likely to die from subsequent Zika infection ( Science News )   Brazil’s Zika mystery  After so many Brazilian babies were born with microcephaly in 2015, the country braced itself for a similar tsunami in 2016. But it didn’t materialize — and researchers have been trying to figure out why. A new paper offers a theory : The authors suggest the region’s first wave of Zika may have been its only wave of Zika to date. Illnesses in 2016, by that reckoning, were caused by a different virus producing lookalike symptoms to Zika — likely the chikungunya virus — but not causing microcephaly. In some ways, that’s good news; it might suggest Zika outbreaks are swift. But it doesn’t mean the virus is done. More likely, said senior author Christopher Dye, is that Zika will return after births create pools of people who have no immunity to the virus, hitting perhaps when people aren’t expecting it.

But in addition to that, there’s a more specific provision that would threaten Zika funding directly, points out Ed Yong at the Atlantic : A halving of the budget for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) program. That program helps state public health laboratories train their staff and buy equipment; these labs are in many cases the ones running blood tests for Zika. When, for instance, Congress failed for months to fund a Zika response last year, Minnesota’s public health laboratory used ELC funds to begin its public testing. With half as much funding, researchers say, being prepared for the next public health threat will be much harder.

The Washington Post reports:  There were two types of solution the District could have purchased to conduct a phase of the test. One bottle came marked with a “D,” for diluted, and the other with a “U”, for undiluted. D.C. lab workers had purchased the diluted version, Tran said, and then mistakenly watered it down as if it was the more concentrated one, weakening the ability to detect for Zika.  That mistake, missed for more than six months, is a worrisome failing — enough so that officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have now audited the lab, the Post reports , to determine how the mistakes were made and whether they’ve been fully rectified.

In one case, a pregnant Las Vegas-area woman has tested positive for Zika, the county’s first non-travel related case. Health officials say she caught the virus via sex; her partner previously tested positive. But, according to local television station KLAS , he was never informed of his test results, in what’s being blamed on a “computer glitch.” It’s not yet clear whether the woman’s fetus has been infected with the virus.  And on the other side of the country, scientists at Washington, D.C.’s public health lab botched Zika tests for more than 400 people from July to December 2016. The “mathematical error” meant that people were getting negative test results when they could have actually been infected. So far officials have identified two pregnant women who were incorrectly told they did not have the virus when in fact they did, reports the Washington Post .

That policy prevents foreign nonprofit groups that receive federal funds from administering abortions or providing abortion counseling or referrals. That could mean a hit to the budget of some nonprofits dealing with Zika, if they continue counseling patients about abortions.

Here’s what you need to know about the Zika virus.  Friday, June 30  A programming note  This will be the final weekly edition of Zika in 30 Seconds. Thank you for reading as, over the last 17 months, we’ve tracked the developing science, the progress toward a vaccine, and the many questions still unanswered about Zika virus.  advertisement        Still, our coverage of Zika will continue. Going forward we’ll use this space to alert you to important news about Zika as it arises — so stay tuned.  And for more regular updates about Zika, follow STAT’s senior writer for global health Helen Branswell on Twitter .  On people’s lips  “The fight against Zika virus is not a 100-m race, but rather a marathon in which science and public health need to work hand in hand for the benefit of our peoples.” — Carissa F. Etienne , director of Pan American Health Organization  What lies ahead  The dramatic global rise of Zika in 2016 was followed by an equally dramatic decline by the end of that year — the reasons for which epidemiologists are still sorting out. But, global health expert Dr. Peter Hotez writes , “While countries such as Brazil no longer seem to be sustaining new transmission, there are new foci popping up in additional Latin American countries, including Ecuador and Peru on the Pacific Coast of South America, as well as in Argentina and Bolivia.”  In the U.S., he says, Florida seems less at risk this year than it was last year, when the state saw more than 200 cases of local Zika transmission.  But, Hotez writes, spread of the virus in Mexico may mean that local cases in Texas crop up later this year.  The bottom line, he says? We’re in a “new normal” for Zika and other similar viruses, both in the U.S. and globally.     Friday, June 23  What’s new this week     The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it would fund a study in Guatemala to determine whether Zika virus is capable of attacking the still-developing brains of newborns. ( STAT )    Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which can carry Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, are more common across the United States than previously believed, federal experts reported. ( NBC News )    The claim that six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, had contracted Zika, was retracted. ( Houston Chronicle )    When seeking a diagnosis    Testing for Zika virus RNA in placental tissue can confirm Zika infection when the mother’s blood tests are inconclusive, according to a new study. The authors emphasize that clinicians should continue to consider testing for Zika RNA when a definitive diagnosis has not been reached. ( Medscape )    Today’s must-read    A clinic mix-up leaves pregnant woman in dark about Zika risk. ( Kaiser Health News )       Friday, June 16  What’s new this week     A group of Florida lawmakers is urging the U.S. Army to hold a hearing on its plan to give Sanofi an exclusive license to develop a Zika virus vaccine, a move that has raised concerns the product may be priced too high for many Americans, even though it was developed with taxpayer funds. ( STAT )    Six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, have tested positive for Zika, the first cases of the mosquito-borne disease to be reported in the area in 2017. ( Houston Chronicle )    Learning the hard way    When Zika struck last year, officials in Miami-Dade County immediately began fogging with permethrin, the active ingredient in home bug-killers such as Raid. Permethrin was sprayed at least seven times, but by the end of August, the county realized the poison had little effect and stopped using it. Officials didn’t get around to testing which pesticides kill Aedes aegypti until October — midway through Zika season. ( Miami New Times )    Today’s must-read    Zika in America: One mother’s saga ( Kaiser Health News )     Friday, June 9  What’s new this week   A new CDC report quantifies Zika’s toll on pregnancies in U.S. territories. Five percent of Zika-affected pregnancies resulted in birth defects, researchers found, and the risk was highest in the first trimester, declining each trimester after ( New York Times )  Health concerns about the pesticide naled — used in Florida and elsewhere to battle Zika — were again raised by a new study. Higher concentrations of naled in the cord blood of Chinese infants was correlated with impaired motor skills at age 9 months ( Miami Herald )   Inside STAT: Fading from view  The public’s sense of alarm over the Zika outbreak has subsided — posing a challenge to health officials who want to keep it on the radar of the people who need to pay attention. Puerto Rico declared its outbreak over this week; Brazil said its emergency was over in May. In the United States, summer approaches with little discussion of the virus outside public health circles. But the risk to pregnant women traveling abroad is still real, and not going to change anytime soon. Read more .  Today’s must-read   A Washington state mother on the challenges of raising a daughter with microcephaly ( Newsworks )    Friday, June 2  What’s new this week   The WHO last Friday announced India’s first three cases of the Zika virus, including two pregnant women — but since then questions have been brewing. More on that below. ( WHO )  A new Discovery Channel documentary about mosquito-borne diseases, slated to air July 6, will feature Jeremy Renner as narrator ( The Hollywood Reporter )  Zika testing in May rose to levels not seen since last August, according to EHR vendor athenahealth ( Healthcare IT News )   India’s Zika silence  In the wake of India’s disclosure last month to the WHO that it had detected three cases of Zika, a number of questions have been raised about why the cases weren’t announced months ago. The Washington Post reports that health ministers said they knew about the country’s first case of Zika back in November of 2016, but they didn’t alert the public because they didn’t want “people to start panicking.” Meanwhile, The Wire points out, the country’s disease surveillance index still says zero cases of Zika have been found in the country, and the WHO has moved India up from the safest category 4 to category 2 in its ranking of Zika risk.  How microcephaly happens  A new paper sheds further light on why the Zika virus takes its most dramatic toll on the developing brain: Because a protein found in those cells helps the virus reproduce. The protein, called Musashi-1, is found in high levels in precursors to neurons — but if Zika virus is present it acts like a sponge, depriving the neurons of the protein. In fact, one family with a congenital mutation in the Musashi-1 gene has two children with microcephaly, the researchers point out, adding further evidence that this protein is key to normal brain development. That discovery may hopefully help scientists devise a way to stop the damage from occurring.  Today’s must-read   US taxpayers are funding a Zika vaccine. Let’s make sure US patients can afford it ( STAT )    Friday, May 26  What’s new this week   Sequencing the genome of Zika virus has indicated that in almost every affected country, Zika was circulating for months — or even years — before the first cases were reported ( The Atlantic )  Though good news for the broader population, a drop in Zika cases in Latin America has made it hard for research studies on the virus to recruit enough participants to have meaningful results ( Nature )  By removing protections for preexisting conditions, the GOP health bill may make insurance prohibitively expensive both for pregnant women who have had Zika and for infants born with microcephaly ( Mother Jones )   Response, in retrospect  The GAO this week released a report on the US government’s response to the Zika epidemic, concluding that the CDC and many states were underprepared to battle the outbreak. The report finds that the federal government could do better specifically on distributing and regulating diagnostic tests and on communicating geographic risk of the virus. The steps that the report concludes that the HHS should take are:   Establish a transparent process to provide CDC diagnostic tests, upon request, to manufacturers that are in the final stages of diagnostic test authorization.  Include information on CDC-developed tests distributed to or shared with public health laboratories on CDC’s website, including laboratory developed tests.  Provide details such as collection records, dates, and data limitations on posted and disseminated mosquito distribution maps to better inform mosquito control experts and the general public.  Consolidate information from individual diagnostic test labels and make this information available in a form that enables users to more readily compare information across tests.  Require manufacturers to list the identity of comparator assays on their diagnostic test labels.   A startling case study  A recently published case study describes an American adolescent who contracted Zika on a trip to the Caribbean. Symptoms of sore throat, headache, rash, and joint pain resolved soon after the individual returned to the US, but a range of worrying psychiatric symptoms — including “excessive energy, decreased sleep, rapid and tangential speech, grandiose thinking, impulsivity, and decreased inhibition” — stuck around for weeks afterward and even necessitated a period of hospitalization. Fifteen weeks after symptom onset, doctors reported, the patient’s symptoms were better but not gone. All told, they write, the case “raise[s] the possibility that Zika virus infection may trigger neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.”  Today’s must-read   ‘I taught them to love Valentina as I do’: Mother’s faith guides struggle to care for daughter with microcephaly ( Milwaukee Journal Sentinel )    Friday, May 19  What’s new this week   Cuba had one of the most successful Zika-reduction campaigns in Latin America last year — but even so, the virus is taking a toll there. Health officials said this week that 1,847 residents have so far contracted the virus, the first such information out of the country in months. It’s unclear how many of those cases were locally transmitted ( Reuters )  Sanofi Pasteur has rejected a request from the US Army to set an affordable US price for a Zika vaccine that the company is developing with American taxpayer funds, prompting an angry response from Senator Bernie Sanders ( STAT )   Fighting cancer with Zika?  Studying Zika’s tragic effects on fetuses has revealed two key qualities of the virus: It can cross the blood-brain barrier, and it specifically targets the developing brain. Now scientists are wondering whether those qualities might make the virus a cancer-killer . A newly funded research project in the UK will examine, in cells and in mice, whether Zika virus can selectively attack and kill brain cancer cells.  A key challenge of delivering drugs to the brain is the blood-brain barrier, which prohibits many molecules from passing into the brain — but Zika appears to be able to pass. What’s more, glioblastoma cells — a highly lethal form of brain cancer — resemble fetal brain cells in a number of ways. Combining those two lines of reasoning, scientists are now embarking on a project to see how Zika interacts with the cancer.   Friday, May 12  What’s new this week   Brazil today declared an end to national emergency status for Zika virus. The number of cases in the country dropped 95 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period a year ago, officials said ( BBC )  In an effort to kill mosquito larvae near homes, residents of one Florida county can get free “mosquito fish” at their local library ( ABC )  The costs, just in the near term, of Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean could be $18 billion, according to a new study. That amount covers just 2015-2017 and it is the upper bound of a wide range of possibilities, depending on rates of transmission ( press release )   Testing advice changes for pregnant women  The CDC is now suggesting that women thinking of getting pregnant, and who may be exposed to the Zika virus, should consider having their blood tested for Zika antibodies before they get pregnant . That’s because IgM, a type of antibody triggered by Zika infection, can stick around in the blood for months, and doctors can’t always tell if the infection happened before pregnancy — which poses no risk to the fetus — or during pregnancy, when it’s a high risk. To distinguish those two scenarios, women at risk of exposure should ideally be tested before pregnancy and again each trimester.   Friday, May 5  What’s new this week   The Prevention and Public Health Fund, which would be eliminated under the health bill that passed the House this week, provides a significant chunk of the CDC’s budget — including funding efforts to fight Zika ( STAT , NASHP )  Miami-Dade County has spent about $25 million on battling Zika so far, officials say ( Miami Herald )   Rift between Puerto Rico and CDC  Of all the states and territories, US health officials last year were especially worried about Zika’s potential impacts in Puerto Rico — which was part of their motivation to create the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System to track pregnant women and identify infants and fetuses with Zika-related birth defects. The CDC awarded Puerto Rico’s Department of Health $9.5 million for the project. But since then the agencies have had a protracted feud, a document obtained by STAT shows, with the CDC claiming that health officials disregarded the established case definition for identifying affected infants — creating the illusion of far fewer affected infants than there may in fact be.  Today’s must-read   Clues to Zika damage might lie in cases of twins ( New York Times )    Friday, April 28  What’s new this week   No mosquitoes tested in Florida so far this year have been positive for Zika, officials report ( AP )  A US Senate panel this week approved $100 million in mosquito control funding. The measure now goes to the full Senate ( Miami Herald )  The US Army is proceeding with plans to grant Sanofi Pasteur an exclusive license to develop a Zika vaccine, despite some groups’ concerns that the product may be priced too high for many Americans ( STAT Plus )   Number of the day: 15 percent  The upper estimate of how much live births in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, fell during the second half of 2016. Scientists don’t yet know why, but suspect that a combination of family planning and Zika-caused miscarriages are to blame. ( New Scientist )  One year later  Since the beginning of the Zika epidemic in 2015, doctors have realized that Zika congenital syndrome can manifest itself in profound ways — brain tissue missing — or subtler deficits, such as hearing loss and vision problems. STAT recently revisited two affected babies — Duda, age 18 months, and Sophia, 1 year — whose divergent stories show the varied effects of the virus, and its profound impacts upon families.

And more than 3,300 pregnant women there are known to have contracted the virus. But the number of babies born in Puerto Rico with microcephaly and other birth defects caused by Zika is unexpectedly low — just 16 cases — which is leading experts to question whether the island territory is downplaying its Zika spread, possibly to protect its tourism industry.   2 more babies have been born in the US with #Zika -induced birth defects. So far 65 pregnancies have been affected.

The trial began Wednesday at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, one of 11 sites involved in the study ( STAT )  The idea that prior infection with dengue could make people’s Zika infection worse got a boost this week from its first test in mice. Researchers found that mice with West Nile or dengue antibodies were much more likely to die from subsequent Zika infection ( Science News )   Brazil’s Zika mystery  After so many Brazilian babies were born with microcephaly in 2015, the country braced itself for a similar tsunami in 2016. But it didn’t materialize — and researchers have been trying to figure out why. A new paper offers a theory : The authors suggest the region’s first wave of Zika may have been its only wave of Zika to date. Illnesses in 2016, by that reckoning, were caused by a different virus producing lookalike symptoms to Zika — likely the chikungunya virus — but not causing microcephaly. In some ways, that’s good news; it might suggest Zika outbreaks are swift. But it doesn’t mean the virus is done. More likely, said senior author Christopher Dye, is that Zika will return after births create pools of people who have no immunity to the virus, hitting perhaps when people aren’t expecting it.  Today’s must-read   Living with Zika in Puerto Rico means watching, waiting, and fearing judgment ( NPR )    Friday, March 24  What’s new this week   The CDC this week reported an additional 7 US babies born with Zika-related birth defects, bringing the total to 54 ( CDC )  Harris County, Tex., home to Houston, is considering releasing sterile genetically-modified mosquitoes to reduce the insects’ numbers. A similar proposal in the Florida Keys is on hold while residents debate it ( CBS )  An improved genetic technique has pieced together the genome sequence of the mosquito that transmits Zika, Aedes aegypti, 10 years after publication of its draft sequence ( Nature )   Budget concerns  President Trump’s budget released last week contained a provision that would eliminate one-eighth of the CDC’s budget . But in addition to that, there’s a more specific provision that would threaten Zika funding directly, points out Ed Yong at the Atlantic : A halving of the budget for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) program. That program helps state public health laboratories train their staff and buy equipment; these labs are in many cases the ones running blood tests for Zika. When, for instance, Congress failed for months to fund a Zika response last year, Minnesota’s public health laboratory used ELC funds to begin its public testing. With half as much funding, researchers say, being prepared for the next public health threat will be much harder.

CDC officials said this week that local infections probably started on June 15, as opposed to July 29, and that they occurred in not just Miami-Dade County but also Broward and Palm Beach Counties, home to the major tourist destinations of Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach ( Reuters )   Intimate portraits of Zika families  A deeply reported feature in the New York Times takes a look at some of Brazil’s Zika babies, now a year old but many of them with developmental levels of just a few months. “The children are still small enough to be held, fed and carried,” Pam Belluck writes. “But ultimately, many may be unable to walk, attend regular schools, or live on their own as adults.” That paints a dire future for families who are already barely keeping afloat.

The Washington Post reports:  There were two types of solution the District could have purchased to conduct a phase of the test. One bottle came marked with a “D,” for diluted, and the other with a “U”, for undiluted. D.C. lab workers had purchased the diluted version, Tran said, and then mistakenly watered it down as if it was the more concentrated one, weakening the ability to detect for Zika.  That mistake, missed for more than six months, is a worrisome failing — enough so that officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have now audited the lab, the Post reports , to determine how the mistakes were made and whether they’ve been fully rectified.

But before they can be actually deployed they will need to be more affordable ( GeekWire )   Screening scandals  Politics isn’t the only realm that’s seen some shocking headlines this week — Zika has as well.  In one case, a pregnant Las Vegas-area woman has tested positive for Zika, the county’s first non-travel related case. Health officials say she caught the virus via sex; her partner previously tested positive. But, according to local television station KLAS , he was never informed of his test results, in what’s being blamed on a “computer glitch.” It’s not yet clear whether the woman’s fetus has been infected with the virus.  And on the other side of the country, scientists at Washington, D.C.’s public health lab botched Zika tests for more than 400 people from July to December 2016. The “mathematical error” meant that people were getting negative test results when they could have actually been infected. So far officials have identified two pregnant women who were incorrectly told they did not have the virus when in fact they did, reports the Washington Post .

That policy prevents foreign nonprofit groups that receive federal funds from administering abortions or providing abortion counseling or referrals. That could mean a hit to the budget of some nonprofits dealing with Zika, if they continue counseling patients about abortions. What’s more, research has shown that the policy in the past has hampered distribution of contraceptives in affected countries. Family planning and contraception are a key strategy in reducing pregnancies affected by Zika, according to the CDC.   Friday, Jan. 20  What’s new this week   Jamaica has reported its first ‘probable’ case of Zika-induced micocephaly ( Jamaica Observer )  Public health experts asked to reflect on the Zika outbreak saw some successes — an incident-free Rio Olympics, swift early vaccine development, and CDC travel advisories — but many failures, including Congress’s inability to pass a Zika bill, and the tens of millions of women living in epidemic areas who were left unprotected ( New York Times )   On people’s lips  “Throughout this horrible time, I couldn’t stop wondering: What were the chances of a false positive?

Among the still-unanswered questions, she says:   how the virus infects and interacts with mosquito and human cells;  which are the key genetic and molecular determinants of pathogenesis;  how long the virus persists in human blood and tissues and its transmissibility;  and how the innate and adaptive immune responses can counteract the virus and protect from reinfection.

One, in pregnant Brazilian women with Zika, found a 42 percent likelihood of birth defects; the other, in pregnant American women with Zika, found that birth defects affected just 6 percent. STAT consulted a number of experts and there appears to be no single answer that explains the huge gap — but differences in geography, disease status, and how birth defects are defined could be contributing to the disconnect.

But the question looming over the research is how much demand there will be for a Zika vaccine by the time any of them make it through three rounds of human testing and approval from the FDA. Drug makers are having to consider a range of possibilities — a Zika vaccine being added to a schedule of vaccines given in childhood, simply being marketed to travelers, or perhaps just being stockpiled to protect against a future epidemic — all of which portend different profits.

Here’s what you need to know about the Zika virus.  Friday, June 30  A programming note  This will be the final weekly edition of Zika in 30 Seconds. Thank you for reading as, over the last 17 months, we’ve tracked the developing science, the progress toward a vaccine, and the many questions still unanswered about Zika virus.  advertisement        Still, our coverage of Zika will continue. Going forward we’ll use this space to alert you to important news about Zika as it arises — so stay tuned.  And for more regular updates about Zika, follow STAT’s senior writer for global health Helen Branswell on Twitter .  On people’s lips  “The fight against Zika virus is not a 100-m race, but rather a marathon in which science and public health need to work hand in hand for the benefit of our peoples.” — Carissa F. Etienne , director of Pan American Health Organization  What lies ahead  The dramatic global rise of Zika in 2016 was followed by an equally dramatic decline by the end of that year — the reasons for which epidemiologists are still sorting out. But, global health expert Dr. Peter Hotez writes , “While countries such as Brazil no longer seem to be sustaining new transmission, there are new foci popping up in additional Latin American countries, including Ecuador and Peru on the Pacific Coast of South America, as well as in Argentina and Bolivia.”  In the U.S., he says, Florida seems less at risk this year than it was last year, when the state saw more than 200 cases of local Zika transmission.  But, Hotez writes, spread of the virus in Mexico may mean that local cases in Texas crop up later this year.  The bottom line, he says? We’re in a “new normal” for Zika and other similar viruses, both in the U.S. and globally.     Friday, June 23  What’s new this week     The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it would fund a study in Guatemala to determine whether Zika virus is capable of attacking the still-developing brains of newborns. ( STAT )    Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which can carry Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, are more common across the United States than previously believed, federal experts reported. ( NBC News )    The claim that six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, had contracted Zika, was retracted. ( Houston Chronicle )    When seeking a diagnosis    Testing for Zika virus RNA in placental tissue can confirm Zika infection when the mother’s blood tests are inconclusive, according to a new study. The authors emphasize that clinicians should continue to consider testing for Zika RNA when a definitive diagnosis has not been reached. ( Medscape )    Today’s must-read    A clinic mix-up leaves pregnant woman in dark about Zika risk. ( Kaiser Health News )       Friday, June 16  What’s new this week     A group of Florida lawmakers is urging the U.S. Army to hold a hearing on its plan to give Sanofi an exclusive license to develop a Zika virus vaccine, a move that has raised concerns the product may be priced too high for many Americans, even though it was developed with taxpayer funds. ( STAT )    Six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, have tested positive for Zika, the first cases of the mosquito-borne disease to be reported in the area in 2017. ( Houston Chronicle )    Learning the hard way    When Zika struck last year, officials in Miami-Dade County immediately began fogging with permethrin, the active ingredient in home bug-killers such as Raid. Permethrin was sprayed at least seven times, but by the end of August, the county realized the poison had little effect and stopped using it. Officials didn’t get around to testing which pesticides kill Aedes aegypti until October — midway through Zika season. ( Miami New Times )    Today’s must-read    Zika in America: One mother’s saga ( Kaiser Health News )     Friday, June 9  What’s new this week   A new CDC report quantifies Zika’s toll on pregnancies in U.S. territories. Five percent of Zika-affected pregnancies resulted in birth defects, researchers found, and the risk was highest in the first trimester, declining each trimester after ( New York Times )  Health concerns about the pesticide naled — used in Florida and elsewhere to battle Zika — were again raised by a new study. Higher concentrations of naled in the cord blood of Chinese infants was correlated with impaired motor skills at age 9 months ( Miami Herald )   Inside STAT: Fading from view  The public’s sense of alarm over the Zika outbreak has subsided — posing a challenge to health officials who want to keep it on the radar of the people who need to pay attention. Puerto Rico declared its outbreak over this week; Brazil said its emergency was over in May. In the United States, summer approaches with little discussion of the virus outside public health circles. But the risk to pregnant women traveling abroad is still real, and not going to change anytime soon. Read more .  Today’s must-read   A Washington state mother on the challenges of raising a daughter with microcephaly ( Newsworks )    Friday, June 2  What’s new this week   The WHO last Friday announced India’s first three cases of the Zika virus, including two pregnant women — but since then questions have been brewing. More on that below. ( WHO )  A new Discovery Channel documentary about mosquito-borne diseases, slated to air July 6, will feature Jeremy Renner as narrator ( The Hollywood Reporter )  Zika testing in May rose to levels not seen since last August, according to EHR vendor athenahealth ( Healthcare IT News )   India’s Zika silence  In the wake of India’s disclosure last month to the WHO that it had detected three cases of Zika, a number of questions have been raised about why the cases weren’t announced months ago. The Washington Post reports that health ministers said they knew about the country’s first case of Zika back in November of 2016, but they didn’t alert the public because they didn’t want “people to start panicking.” Meanwhile, The Wire points out, the country’s disease surveillance index still says zero cases of Zika have been found in the country, and the WHO has moved India up from the safest category 4 to category 2 in its ranking of Zika risk.  How microcephaly happens  A new paper sheds further light on why the Zika virus takes its most dramatic toll on the developing brain: Because a protein found in those cells helps the virus reproduce. The protein, called Musashi-1, is found in high levels in precursors to neurons — but if Zika virus is present it acts like a sponge, depriving the neurons of the protein. In fact, one family with a congenital mutation in the Musashi-1 gene has two children with microcephaly, the researchers point out, adding further evidence that this protein is key to normal brain development. That discovery may hopefully help scientists devise a way to stop the damage from occurring.  Today’s must-read   US taxpayers are funding a Zika vaccine. Let’s make sure US patients can afford it ( STAT )    Friday, May 26  What’s new this week   Sequencing the genome of Zika virus has indicated that in almost every affected country, Zika was circulating for months — or even years — before the first cases were reported ( The Atlantic )  Though good news for the broader population, a drop in Zika cases in Latin America has made it hard for research studies on the virus to recruit enough participants to have meaningful results ( Nature )  By removing protections for preexisting conditions, the GOP health bill may make insurance prohibitively expensive both for pregnant women who have had Zika and for infants born with microcephaly ( Mother Jones )   Response, in retrospect  The GAO this week released a report on the US government’s response to the Zika epidemic, concluding that the CDC and many states were underprepared to battle the outbreak. The report finds that the federal government could do better specifically on distributing and regulating diagnostic tests and on communicating geographic risk of the virus. The steps that the report concludes that the HHS should take are:   Establish a transparent process to provide CDC diagnostic tests, upon request, to manufacturers that are in the final stages of diagnostic test authorization.  Include information on CDC-developed tests distributed to or shared with public health laboratories on CDC’s website, including laboratory developed tests.  Provide details such as collection records, dates, and data limitations on posted and disseminated mosquito distribution maps to better inform mosquito control experts and the general public.  Consolidate information from individual diagnostic test labels and make this information available in a form that enables users to more readily compare information across tests.  Require manufacturers to list the identity of comparator assays on their diagnostic test labels.   A startling case study  A recently published case study describes an American adolescent who contracted Zika on a trip to the Caribbean. Symptoms of sore throat, headache, rash, and joint pain resolved soon after the individual returned to the US, but a range of worrying psychiatric symptoms — including “excessive energy, decreased sleep, rapid and tangential speech, grandiose thinking, impulsivity, and decreased inhibition” — stuck around for weeks afterward and even necessitated a period of hospitalization. Fifteen weeks after symptom onset, doctors reported, the patient’s symptoms were better but not gone. All told, they write, the case “raise[s] the possibility that Zika virus infection may trigger neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.”  Today’s must-read   ‘I taught them to love Valentina as I do’: Mother’s faith guides struggle to care for daughter with microcephaly ( Milwaukee Journal Sentinel )    Friday, May 19  What’s new this week   Cuba had one of the most successful Zika-reduction campaigns in Latin America last year — but even so, the virus is taking a toll there. Health officials said this week that 1,847 residents have so far contracted the virus, the first such information out of the country in months. It’s unclear how many of those cases were locally transmitted ( Reuters )  Sanofi Pasteur has rejected a request from the US Army to set an affordable US price for a Zika vaccine that the company is developing with American taxpayer funds, prompting an angry response from Senator Bernie Sanders ( STAT )   Fighting cancer with Zika?  Studying Zika’s tragic effects on fetuses has revealed two key qualities of the virus: It can cross the blood-brain barrier, and it specifically targets the developing brain. Now scientists are wondering whether those qualities might make the virus a cancer-killer . A newly funded research project in the UK will examine, in cells and in mice, whether Zika virus can selectively attack and kill brain cancer cells.  A key challenge of delivering drugs to the brain is the blood-brain barrier, which prohibits many molecules from passing into the brain — but Zika appears to be able to pass. What’s more, glioblastoma cells — a highly lethal form of brain cancer — resemble fetal brain cells in a number of ways. Combining those two lines of reasoning, scientists are now embarking on a project to see how Zika interacts with the cancer.   Friday, May 12  What’s new this week   Brazil today declared an end to national emergency status for Zika virus. The number of cases in the country dropped 95 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period a year ago, officials said ( BBC )  In an effort to kill mosquito larvae near homes, residents of one Florida county can get free “mosquito fish” at their local library ( ABC )  The costs, just in the near term, of Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean could be $18 billion, according to a new study. That amount covers just 2015-2017 and it is the upper bound of a wide range of possibilities, depending on rates of transmission ( press release )   Testing advice changes for pregnant women  The CDC is now suggesting that women thinking of getting pregnant, and who may be exposed to the Zika virus, should consider having their blood tested for Zika antibodies before they get pregnant . That’s because IgM, a type of antibody triggered by Zika infection, can stick around in the blood for months, and doctors can’t always tell if the infection happened before pregnancy — which poses no risk to the fetus — or during pregnancy, when it’s a high risk. To distinguish those two scenarios, women at risk of exposure should ideally be tested before pregnancy and again each trimester.   Friday, May 5  What’s new this week   The Prevention and Public Health Fund, which would be eliminated under the health bill that passed the House this week, provides a significant chunk of the CDC’s budget — including funding efforts to fight Zika ( STAT , NASHP )  Miami-Dade County has spent about $25 million on battling Zika so far, officials say ( Miami Herald )   Rift between Puerto Rico and CDC  Of all the states and territories, US health officials last year were especially worried about Zika’s potential impacts in Puerto Rico — which was part of their motivation to create the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System to track pregnant women and identify infants and fetuses with Zika-related birth defects. The CDC awarded Puerto Rico’s Department of Health $9.5 million for the project. But since then the agencies have had a protracted feud, a document obtained by STAT shows, with the CDC claiming that health officials disregarded the established case definition for identifying affected infants — creating the illusion of far fewer affected infants than there may in fact be.  Today’s must-read   Clues to Zika damage might lie in cases of twins ( New York Times )    Friday, April 28  What’s new this week   No mosquitoes tested in Florida so far this year have been positive for Zika, officials report ( AP )  A US Senate panel this week approved $100 million in mosquito control funding. The measure now goes to the full Senate ( Miami Herald )  The US Army is proceeding with plans to grant Sanofi Pasteur an exclusive license to develop a Zika vaccine, despite some groups’ concerns that the product may be priced too high for many Americans ( STAT Plus )   Number of the day: 15 percent  The upper estimate of how much live births in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, fell during the second half of 2016. Scientists don’t yet know why, but suspect that a combination of family planning and Zika-caused miscarriages are to blame. ( New Scientist )  One year later  Since the beginning of the Zika epidemic in 2015, doctors have realized that Zika congenital syndrome can manifest itself in profound ways — brain tissue missing — or subtler deficits, such as hearing loss and vision problems. STAT recently revisited two affected babies — Duda, age 18 months, and Sophia, 1 year — whose divergent stories show the varied effects of the virus, and its profound impacts upon families.

And more than 3,300 pregnant women there are known to have contracted the virus. But the number of babies born in Puerto Rico with microcephaly and other birth defects caused by Zika is unexpectedly low — just 16 cases — which is leading experts to question whether the island territory is downplaying its Zika spread, possibly to protect its tourism industry.   2 more babies have been born in the US with #Zika -induced birth defects. So far 65 pregnancies have been affected.

Instead of looking for viral RNA, the test looks for antibodies against the virus, which can persist much longer in a person’s blood. Similar tests currently used, however, can be hard to interpret and often need to be confirmed by a CDC laboratory ( press release )  A new type of CRISPR system can detect tiny amounts of Zika and other viruses, presenting a promising avenue for future diagnostic tests ( STAT )  Texas is urging pregnant women in six counties at risk of Zika to be tested for the virus ( NBC )   ICYMI  If you missed seeing photojournalist Katie Falkenberg’s series from Brazil , now’s a good opportunity, as she was one of the finalists for the Pulitzer feature photography category.

The trial began Wednesday at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, one of 11 sites involved in the study ( STAT )  The idea that prior infection with dengue could make people’s Zika infection worse got a boost this week from its first test in mice. Researchers found that mice with West Nile or dengue antibodies were much more likely to die from subsequent Zika infection ( Science News )   Brazil’s Zika mystery  After so many Brazilian babies were born with microcephaly in 2015, the country braced itself for a similar tsunami in 2016. But it didn’t materialize — and researchers have been trying to figure out why. A new paper offers a theory : The authors suggest the region’s first wave of Zika may have been its only wave of Zika to date. Illnesses in 2016, by that reckoning, were caused by a different virus producing lookalike symptoms to Zika — likely the chikungunya virus — but not causing microcephaly. In some ways, that’s good news; it might suggest Zika outbreaks are swift. But it doesn’t mean the virus is done. More likely, said senior author Christopher Dye, is that Zika will return after births create pools of people who have no immunity to the virus, hitting perhaps when people aren’t expecting it.  Today’s must-read   Living with Zika in Puerto Rico means watching, waiting, and fearing judgment ( NPR )    Friday, March 24  What’s new this week   The CDC this week reported an additional 7 US babies born with Zika-related birth defects, bringing the total to 54 ( CDC )  Harris County, Tex., home to Houston, is considering releasing sterile genetically-modified mosquitoes to reduce the insects’ numbers. A similar proposal in the Florida Keys is on hold while residents debate it ( CBS )  An improved genetic technique has pieced together the genome sequence of the mosquito that transmits Zika, Aedes aegypti, 10 years after publication of its draft sequence ( Nature )   Budget concerns  President Trump’s budget released last week contained a provision that would eliminate one-eighth of the CDC’s budget . But in addition to that, there’s a more specific provision that would threaten Zika funding directly, points out Ed Yong at the Atlantic : A halving of the budget for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) program. That program helps state public health laboratories train their staff and buy equipment; these labs are in many cases the ones running blood tests for Zika. When, for instance, Congress failed for months to fund a Zika response last year, Minnesota’s public health laboratory used ELC funds to begin its public testing. With half as much funding, researchers say, being prepared for the next public health threat will be much harder.

CDC officials said this week that local infections probably started on June 15, as opposed to July 29, and that they occurred in not just Miami-Dade County but also Broward and Palm Beach Counties, home to the major tourist destinations of Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach ( Reuters )   Intimate portraits of Zika families  A deeply reported feature in the New York Times takes a look at some of Brazil’s Zika babies, now a year old but many of them with developmental levels of just a few months. “The children are still small enough to be held, fed and carried,” Pam Belluck writes. “But ultimately, many may be unable to walk, attend regular schools, or live on their own as adults.” That paints a dire future for families who are already barely keeping afloat. Read the full story here , and read a reporter’s notebook from the scene here .  Twitter  Friday, March 10  What’s new this week   The future of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provided some states with funding to fight Zika last year, is in doubt.

That includes spreading pesticide and larvicide, doing on-the-ground inspections, and keeping up with their “mosquito surveillance network” of more than 130 bug traps across the county. So far this year no US residents have contracted Zika from a local mosquito.

The Washington Post reports:  There were two types of solution the District could have purchased to conduct a phase of the test. One bottle came marked with a “D,” for diluted, and the other with a “U”, for undiluted. D.C. lab workers had purchased the diluted version, Tran said, and then mistakenly watered it down as if it was the more concentrated one, weakening the ability to detect for Zika.  That mistake, missed for more than six months, is a worrisome failing — enough so that officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have now audited the lab, the Post reports , to determine how the mistakes were made and whether they’ve been fully rectified.

But before they can be actually deployed they will need to be more affordable ( GeekWire )   Screening scandals  Politics isn’t the only realm that’s seen some shocking headlines this week — Zika has as well.  In one case, a pregnant Las Vegas-area woman has tested positive for Zika, the county’s first non-travel related case. Health officials say she caught the virus via sex; her partner previously tested positive. But, according to local television station KLAS , he was never informed of his test results, in what’s being blamed on a “computer glitch.” It’s not yet clear whether the woman’s fetus has been infected with the virus.  And on the other side of the country, scientists at Washington, D.C.’s public health lab botched Zika tests for more than 400 people from July to December 2016. The “mathematical error” meant that people were getting negative test results when they could have actually been infected. So far officials have identified two pregnant women who were incorrectly told they did not have the virus when in fact they did, reports the Washington Post .

That policy prevents foreign nonprofit groups that receive federal funds from administering abortions or providing abortion counseling or referrals. That could mean a hit to the budget of some nonprofits dealing with Zika, if they continue counseling patients about abortions. What’s more, research has shown that the policy in the past has hampered distribution of contraceptives in affected countries. Family planning and contraception are a key strategy in reducing pregnancies affected by Zika, according to the CDC.

Hide Caption 29 of 29 Story highlights Only 1 in 5 people will develop any symptoms; symptoms are typically mild and temporary There is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection (CNN) The Zika virus was discovered nearly 70 years ago, but chances are you probably hadn't heard of it until the past few months. With fear and uncertainty spreading as quickly as the virus itself, CNN Health wanted to address some of your pressing questions on the topic. To stay informed on the latest Zika news and most up-to-date information, bookmark: CNN.com/Zika . Should I be worried about Zika? The Zika virus is part of the same family as yellow fever , West Nile , chikungunya and dengue . But there is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection. Read More Even though symptoms are most often mild, Zika is commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly , a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. It causes severe developmental issues and, in some cases, can result in death. What are the chances I'll get the Zika virus? The virus is most commonly transmitted when an Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a person with an active infection and then spreads the virus by biting others. Originally discovered in a Ugandan forest, the aggressive mosquito is now predominantly raising concerns in Central and South America. If there are no infected mosquitoes in your area, you're very unlikely to contract the disease. Zika has been sexually transmitted in Texas, CDC confirms On February 2, the CDC confirmed the first case of sexually transmitted Zika in the latest outbreak. A male patient who had recently returned from Venezuela infected with Zika returned to the United States and infected his sexual partner, who had not traveled. The CDC issued interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus and noted that "there have been no reports of sexual transmission of Zika virus from infected women to their sex partners." "Until we know more, if your male sexual partner has traveled to or lives in an area with active Zika virus transmission, you should abstain from sex or use condoms the right way every time you have vaginal, anal and oral sex for the duration of the pregnancy," the updated guidance says. CDC issues new safe-sex guidelines around Zika virus While the virus has been documented in breast milk, saliva and urine, it has not yet been confirmed if the virus can be transmitted through any bodily fluids other than blood. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta , "There have been isolated cases of spread through blood transfusion or sexual contact and that's not very surprising. The virus is in the blood for about a week. How long it would remain in the semen is something that needs to be studied and we're working on that now." Frieden said that studies on sexual transmission are not easy studies to do, but the CDC is continuing to explore that avenue of transmission. "What we know is the vast majority of spread is going to be from mosquitoes," Frieden said. "The bottom line is mosquitoes are the real culprit here." What are the symptoms and effects? Only about one in five people infected with Zika virus will actually become ill, according to the CDC . "The most common symptoms of Zika are fever are rash, joint pain or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other symptoms include muscle pain and headache," the CDC says. For most people, the illness is mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. People don't usually get sick enough to require a hospital visit, and the virus very rarely results in death. JUST WATCHED What is the Zika virus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the Zika virus?  01:32 More seriously, Zika has been linked the birth defect microcephaly, as well as Guillain-Barré , a rare syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves. It's important to note: a link does not necessarily indicate cause and effect. Aside from either of these conditions, there are no lasting, long-term effects of Zika. Additionally, once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections, according to the CDC. What should I do if I think I've been exposed? If you think you may have been exposed to the Zika virus, stop and ask yourself these three questions: 1. Are you pregnant? 2. Are you a woman who is thinking about getting pregnant? 3. Are you a man who is going to have unprotected sex with a woman who is pregnant or may become pregnant? If your answer to all of these questions is "no," there is arguably no reason for you to get tested. Remember, only 20% people who contract the virus will even develop any symptoms, and those who do will experience only mild and short-lived discomfort. If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, however, you should contact your doctor about being tested for Zika. He or she can order blood tests to look for Zika or other similar viral diseases, such as dengue or chikungunya. A blood test performed in a clinical setting is the only way to be definitively diagnosed. How I can I be treated if I have the Zika virus? Unfortunately, as of now, there is no vaccine or specific medicine to treat Zika virus infections. Instead, the CDC recommends treating the symptoms: -- Get plenty of rest. -- Drink fluids to prevent dehydration. -- Take medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce fever and pain. -- Do not take aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If you are taking medicine for another medical condition, talk to your health care provider before taking additional medication. How can I keep myself safe in the U.S. or abroad? How to keep away mosquitoes carrying Zika, dengue With no vaccine available, the only protection against Zika is to avoid traveling to areas with an active infestation. If you do travel to a country where Zika is present, the CDC advises strict adherence to mosquito protection measures: Use an EPA-approved repellent over sunscreen, wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts thick enough to block a mosquito bite, and sleep in an air-conditioned, screened room. If you have Zika, you can keep from spreading it to others by avoiding mosquito bites during the first week of illness, the CDC said. The female Aedes aegypti, the primary carrier of Zika, is an aggressive biter, preferring daytime to dusk and indoors to outdoors. Keeping screens on windows and doors is critical to preventing entry to homes and hotel rooms.

By Alexandra Sifferlin  June 23, 2017        TIME Health  For more, visit TIME Health .   Last summer, public health experts were on high alert due to the rapid spread of the Zika virus , which has now been proven to cause birth defects and other health problems in infants. Today, experts know far more about the virus than they did at the start of the outbreak. Here’s what you need to know now about Zika.  Should pregnant women worry about Zika while traveling?  Short answer: yes. “Our general advice is that if you are pregnant, you should not go to places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing,” says Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “It’s all a matter of risk. Obviously, if you are staying in an air-conditioned hotel, your risk may be less. However, are you willing to take that risk? We know the consequences of infection of the fetus are huge and lifelong.”      Petersen recommends people check the CDC website for guidance on what locations have active Zika transmission. The CDC updates this list regularly, sometimes on a daily basis. If an area is no longer on the list, Petersen says it’s considered safe to travel. Currently, the CDC recommends that if a pregnant woman or her partner travel to an area with Zika, the couple should use condoms every time they have sex or avoid sex for the rest of the pregnancy, even if they do not have symptoms of Zika.

View Sample    Sign Up Now     Should women who plan to get pregnant avoid traveling to places with Zika?  Women who are planning to get pregnant, and their partners, should also pay attention to where they are traveling. The first trimester, during which women may not know they are pregnant, appears to be the most risky time when it comes to Zika-related health complications for infants down the line.    The CDC recommends that women who travel to areas with Zika who want to get pregnant in the near future wait at least eight weeks after their last possible exposure to the virus before trying to conceive. For male partners, the CDC advises waiting six months after the last possible exposure before trying to conceive. Using condoms is also recommended for the waiting period.  What if I am invited to a destination wedding in a place with Zika? Should I not go?  It may be challenging to get a firm yes or no from your doctor about whether or not you should travel for a major event, though the recommendations are not to go to places with active Zika transmission if you’re pregnant or want to be soon. “My job is to give guidance; I never tell people what to do,” says Dr. Richard Beigi, the chief medical officer of the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “But I think the travel warnings are there for a reason, and nothing has changed from last year other than the fact that we have more information that has validated that Zika causes congenital health problems. The overall risk is the same.”      Deciding to travel despite the risk is ultimately a personal decision. “I ask my patients, ‘Do you really need to go?’ For some people, the answer to that is yes, and that’s fine, and I give them the best advice I can,” Beigi says.  Should I worry about traveling to places that have the types of mosquitoes that can spread Zika?  The CDC recently reported that the types of mosquito that carry Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , are appearing in more counties in the southern U.S. where they haven’t been before. But unless the mosquitoes are transmitting Zika, there’s a “very, very, very low risk,” Petersen says. “In all of the places where we have this kind of mosquito that can spread Zika virus, we also see the kinds of mosquitoes that can spread West Nile and other diseases,” says Petersen. “General mosquito precautions in the summer are important for everybody—not only pregnant women.”      How likely is it that I will get Zika?  Experts can’t give a definitive answer to a person’s chances of getting Zika if they travel to a place that has reported spread of the disease. But experts are getting closer to understanding the likelihood of adverse events should a pregnant woman get infected.  A recent study found that one in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. with a Zika infection had a baby with brain damage or other serious birth defects. The first trimester was the most critical time: 15% of women with confirmed Zika infection in the first trimester had babies with birth defects. Another study found similar numbers for women in U.S. territories, revealing that during their first trimester, nearly 1 in 12 had a baby or fetus with Zika-associated birth defects.      “Out of the data collected, it appears that 5-10% of the time a woman gets Zika during her pregnancy, there will be in impact,” says Beigi. “Most of the impact is a malfunction; some of it is miscarriage. Probably the absolute risk of you having a problem is not very big, but it’s not zero, and it’s hard to know.”  How bad will Zika get in the U.S. this summer?  It’s unclear how many cases of Zika will be expected in and outside the U.S. this summer, though experts say it could be lower than last year. “Based on historical evidence, we would expect that outbreaks this year throughout the Western Hemisphere are going to be less than they were the year before,” says Petersen. “It’s not going away, but since a lot of people have already been infected and are no longer susceptible to infection, it will lower the number of cases over time.”  So far in 2017, about 650 Americans have gotten Zika, though that it is considered an underestimate. Most people do not experience symptoms and will not know they have the virus.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

How should insect repellents be used on children to prevent mosquito bites and the viruses that some mosquitoes can spread? Is it safe for infants or children to travel to an area with risk of Zika? What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika? Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States? What is CDC doing about Zika?      Q: What is Zika?  A: Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus, which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting up to a week, and many people do not have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: How do people get infected with Zika?  A: Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). A pregnant woman can pass Zika to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Also, a person with Zika can pass it to his or her sex partners. We encourage people who have traveled to or live in places with risk of Zika to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What health problems can result from getting Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika will have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last several days to a week. However, Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Current research suggests that Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) , an uncommon sickness of the nervous system, is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS.  Once someone has been infected with Zika, it’s very likely they’ll be protected from future infections. There is no evidence that past Zika infection poses an increased risk of birth defects in future pregnancies.     Q: Should pregnant women travel to areas with risk of Zika ?  A: No. Pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika . Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and Zika infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: If I am traveling to an area with risk of Zika, should I be concerned about Zika?  A: Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and CDC has issued travel recommendations for people traveling to areas with a CDC Zika Travel Notice. Many people will have mild or no symptoms. However, Zika can cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects. For this reason, pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika , and women trying to get pregnant should talk to their doctors before traveling or before their sex partners travel to an area with risk of Zika . It is especially important that women who wish to delay or avoid pregnancy consistently use the most effective method of birth control that they are able to use. Those traveling to areas with risk of Zika should take steps during and after they travel to prevent mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What can people do to prevent Zika?  A: The best way to prevent Zika is to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites:  Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents  Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.  Zika can be spread by a person infected with Zika to his or her sex partners. Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex. Condoms include male and female condoms. To be effective, condoms should be used from start to finish, every time during vaginal, anal, and oral sex and the sharing of sex toys. Not having sex eliminates the risk of getting Zika from sex. Pregnant couples with a partner who traveled to or lives in an area with risk of Zika should use condoms every time they have sex or not have sex during the pregnancy.     Q: What are the symptoms of Zika virus disease?  A: The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika won’t have symptoms or will have mild symptoms, which can last for several days to a week.     Q: How is Zika diagnosed?  A: To diagnose Zika, your doctor will ask you about recent travel and symptoms you may have, and collect blood or urine to test for Zika or similar viruses.     Q: Can someone who returned from an area with risk of Zika get tested for the virus?  A: Zika virus testing is performed at CDC and some state and territorial health departments. See your doctor if you have Zika symptoms and have recently been in an area with risk of Zika . Your doctor may order tests to look for Zika or similar viruses like dengue and chikungunya.     Q: What should pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika do?  A: Pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika should talk to their doctor about their travel, even if they don’t feel sick. Pregnant women should see a doctor if they have any Zika symptoms during their trip or after traveling. All pregnant women can protect themselves by avoiding travel to an area with risk of Zika, preventing mosquito bites , and following recommended precautions against getting Zika through sex .     Q: I am not pregnant, but will my future pregnancies be at risk if I am infected with Zika virus?  A: Currently, there is no evidence that a woman who has recovered from Zika virus infection (the virus has cleared her body) will have Zika-related pregnancy complications in the future. Based on information about similar infections, once a person has been infected with Zika virus and has cleared the virus from his or her body, he or she is likely to be protected from future Zika infections.  If you’re thinking about having a baby in the near future and you or your partner live in or traveled to an area with risk of Zika , talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider. See Women & Their Partners Trying to Become Pregnant .     Q: I was in a place with risk of Zika recently. How long do I need to wait after returning to get pregnant?  A: Men who have traveled to a place with a CDC Zika travel notice or a red area of Zika active transmission in the United States should wait at least 6 months after travel (or 6 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to conceive with their partner. Women should wait at least 8 weeks after travel (or 8 weeks after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to get pregnant. The waiting period is longer for men because Zika stays in semen longer than in other body fluids. Travelers to areas with risk of Zika but no CDC Zika travel notice should talk to their healthcare provider. Travelers to yellow Zika cautionary areas can consider waiting these timeframes before trying to conceive. If either partner has symptoms of Zika or tests positive for Zika after travel, they should follow the suggested timeframes above before trying to get pregnant.     Q: Which insect repellents work best to prevent infections caused by mosquito bites?  A: To prevent Zika and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents on exposed skin. The insect repellent should include one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. Always follow the label instructions when using insect repellent.     Q: How should insect repellents be used on children to prevent mosquito bites and the viruses that some mosquitoes can spread?  A: You should not use insect repellents on babies younger than 2 months old. Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old. Do not apply insect repellent onto a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin. Adults should spray insect repellent onto their hands and then apply to a child’s face. Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.     Q: Is it safe for infants or children to travel to an area with risk of Zika?  A: CDC’s travel guidance for areas with risk of Zika applies to infants and children, as well as adults. CDC recommends that those who travel to areas with risk of Zika protect themselves from mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning from travel. For safe and effective ways to protect your child from mosquito bites, please visit CDC’s Zika prevention page . Most children infected with Zika virus have no symptoms or have a mild illness, similar to adults with Zika virus infection.     Q: What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms lasting several days to a week. If you have symptoms of Zika (fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain) and you live in or recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika , you should see your doctor or healthcare provider and tell him or her about your symptoms and recent travel. There is no specific medicine for Zika, but you can treat the symptoms . If you are diagnosed with Zika, protect those around you by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites and to prevent sexual transmission of Zika. Because Zika can generally be found in blood during approximately the first week of infection and can be passed to another person through mosquito bites, help prevent others from getting sick by strictly following steps to prevent mosquito bites during the first week of illness.     Q: Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States?  A: Local mosquito-borne spread of Zika has been reported in the continental United States. CDC has guidance for people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County, Florida , and Brownsville, Texas .  Many areas in the United States have the type of mosquitoes that can become infected with and spread Zika virus. Everyone can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, staying in places with air conditioning and window and door screens, treating clothing and gear with permethrin, and using EPA-registered insect repellents that contain one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone.     Q: What is CDC doing about Zika?  A: CDC is working around the clock to respond to the Zika virus outbreak. CDC’s work includes developing laboratory tests to diagnose Zika, conducting studies to learn more about Zika, publishing reports about Zika, monitoring and reporting cases of Zika, providing guidance to travelers and Americans living in areas with outbreaks, providing on-the-ground support in countries and US territories with current Zika outbreaks, and more.

What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika? Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States? What is CDC doing about Zika?      Q: What is Zika?  A: Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus, which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting up to a week, and many people do not have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: How do people get infected with Zika?  A: Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). A pregnant woman can pass Zika to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Also, a person with Zika can pass it to his or her sex partners. We encourage people who have traveled to or live in places with risk of Zika to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What health problems can result from getting Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika will have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last several days to a week. However, Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Current research suggests that Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) , an uncommon sickness of the nervous system, is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS.  Once someone has been infected with Zika, it’s very likely they’ll be protected from future infections. There is no evidence that past Zika infection poses an increased risk of birth defects in future pregnancies.     Q: Should pregnant women travel to areas with risk of Zika ?  A: No. Pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika . Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and Zika infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: If I am traveling to an area with risk of Zika, should I be concerned about Zika?

Current research suggests that Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) , an uncommon sickness of the nervous system, is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS.  Once someone has been infected with Zika, it’s very likely they’ll be protected from future infections. There is no evidence that past Zika infection poses an increased risk of birth defects in future pregnancies.     Q: Should pregnant women travel to areas with risk of Zika ?  A: No. Pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika . Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and Zika infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: If I am traveling to an area with risk of Zika, should I be concerned about Zika?  A: Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and CDC has issued travel recommendations for people traveling to areas with a CDC Zika Travel Notice. Many people will have mild or no symptoms. However, Zika can cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects. For this reason, pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika , and women trying to get pregnant should talk to their doctors before traveling or before their sex partners travel to an area with risk of Zika . It is especially important that women who wish to delay or avoid pregnancy consistently use the most effective method of birth control that they are able to use. Those traveling to areas with risk of Zika should take steps during and after they travel to prevent mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What can people do to prevent Zika?  A: The best way to prevent Zika is to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites:  Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents  Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.  Zika can be spread by a person infected with Zika to his or her sex partners. Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex. Condoms include male and female condoms. To be effective, condoms should be used from start to finish, every time during vaginal, anal, and oral sex and the sharing of sex toys. Not having sex eliminates the risk of getting Zika from sex. Pregnant couples with a partner who traveled to or lives in an area with risk of Zika should use condoms every time they have sex or not have sex during the pregnancy.     Q: What are the symptoms of Zika virus disease?  A: The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika won’t have symptoms or will have mild symptoms, which can last for several days to a week.     Q: How is Zika diagnosed?  A: To diagnose Zika, your doctor will ask you about recent travel and symptoms you may have, and collect blood or urine to test for Zika or similar viruses.     Q: Can someone who returned from an area with risk of Zika get tested for the virus?  A: Zika virus testing is performed at CDC and some state and territorial health departments. See your doctor if you have Zika symptoms and have recently been in an area with risk of Zika . Your doctor may order tests to look for Zika or similar viruses like dengue and chikungunya.     Q: What should pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika do?  A: Pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika should talk to their doctor about their travel, even if they don’t feel sick. Pregnant women should see a doctor if they have any Zika symptoms during their trip or after traveling. All pregnant women can protect themselves by avoiding travel to an area with risk of Zika, preventing mosquito bites , and following recommended precautions against getting Zika through sex .     Q: I am not pregnant, but will my future pregnancies be at risk if I am infected with Zika virus?  A: Currently, there is no evidence that a woman who has recovered from Zika virus infection (the virus has cleared her body) will have Zika-related pregnancy complications in the future. Based on information about similar infections, once a person has been infected with Zika virus and has cleared the virus from his or her body, he or she is likely to be protected from future Zika infections.  If you’re thinking about having a baby in the near future and you or your partner live in or traveled to an area with risk of Zika , talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider. See Women & Their Partners Trying to Become Pregnant .     Q: I was in a place with risk of Zika recently. How long do I need to wait after returning to get pregnant?  A: Men who have traveled to a place with a CDC Zika travel notice or a red area of Zika active transmission in the United States should wait at least 6 months after travel (or 6 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to conceive with their partner. Women should wait at least 8 weeks after travel (or 8 weeks after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to get pregnant. The waiting period is longer for men because Zika stays in semen longer than in other body fluids. Travelers to areas with risk of Zika but no CDC Zika travel notice should talk to their healthcare provider. Travelers to yellow Zika cautionary areas can consider waiting these timeframes before trying to conceive. If either partner has symptoms of Zika or tests positive for Zika after travel, they should follow the suggested timeframes above before trying to get pregnant.     Q: Which insect repellents work best to prevent infections caused by mosquito bites?  A: To prevent Zika and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents on exposed skin. The insect repellent should include one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. Always follow the label instructions when using insect repellent.     Q: How should insect repellents be used on children to prevent mosquito bites and the viruses that some mosquitoes can spread?  A: You should not use insect repellents on babies younger than 2 months old. Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old. Do not apply insect repellent onto a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin. Adults should spray insect repellent onto their hands and then apply to a child’s face. Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.     Q: Is it safe for infants or children to travel to an area with risk of Zika?  A: CDC’s travel guidance for areas with risk of Zika applies to infants and children, as well as adults. CDC recommends that those who travel to areas with risk of Zika protect themselves from mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning from travel. For safe and effective ways to protect your child from mosquito bites, please visit CDC’s Zika prevention page . Most children infected with Zika virus have no symptoms or have a mild illness, similar to adults with Zika virus infection.     Q: What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms lasting several days to a week. If you have symptoms of Zika (fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain) and you live in or recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika , you should see your doctor or healthcare provider and tell him or her about your symptoms and recent travel. There is no specific medicine for Zika, but you can treat the symptoms . If you are diagnosed with Zika, protect those around you by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites and to prevent sexual transmission of Zika. Because Zika can generally be found in blood during approximately the first week of infection and can be passed to another person through mosquito bites, help prevent others from getting sick by strictly following steps to prevent mosquito bites during the first week of illness.     Q: Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States?  A: Local mosquito-borne spread of Zika has been reported in the continental United States. CDC has guidance for people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County, Florida , and Brownsville, Texas .  Many areas in the United States have the type of mosquitoes that can become infected with and spread Zika virus. Everyone can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, staying in places with air conditioning and window and door screens, treating clothing and gear with permethrin, and using EPA-registered insect repellents that contain one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone.     Q: What is CDC doing about Zika?  A: CDC is working around the clock to respond to the Zika virus outbreak. CDC’s work includes developing laboratory tests to diagnose Zika, conducting studies to learn more about Zika, publishing reports about Zika, monitoring and reporting cases of Zika, providing guidance to travelers and Americans living in areas with outbreaks, providing on-the-ground support in countries and US territories with current Zika outbreaks, and more.

What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika? Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States? What is CDC doing about Zika?      Q: What is Zika?  A: Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus, which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting up to a week, and many people do not have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: How do people get infected with Zika?  A: Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). A pregnant woman can pass Zika to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Also, a person with Zika can pass it to his or her sex partners. We encourage people who have traveled to or live in places with risk of Zika to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What health problems can result from getting Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika will have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last several days to a week.

A: Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus, which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting up to a week, and many people do not have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: How do people get infected with Zika?  A: Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito ( Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). A pregnant woman can pass Zika to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Also, a person with Zika can pass it to his or her sex partners. We encourage people who have traveled to or live in places with risk of Zika to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What health problems can result from getting Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika will have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last several days to a week. However, Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Current research suggests that Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) , an uncommon sickness of the nervous system, is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS.  Once someone has been infected with Zika, it’s very likely they’ll be protected from future infections. There is no evidence that past Zika infection poses an increased risk of birth defects in future pregnancies.     Q: Should pregnant women travel to areas with risk of Zika ?  A: No. Pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika . Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and Zika infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects.     Q: If I am traveling to an area with risk of Zika, should I be concerned about Zika?  A: Travelers who go to places with risk of Zika can be infected with Zika, and CDC has issued travel recommendations for people traveling to areas with a CDC Zika Travel Notice. Many people will have mild or no symptoms. However, Zika can cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects. For this reason, pregnant women should not travel to any area with risk of Zika , and women trying to get pregnant should talk to their doctors before traveling or before their sex partners travel to an area with risk of Zika . It is especially important that women who wish to delay or avoid pregnancy consistently use the most effective method of birth control that they are able to use. Those traveling to areas with risk of Zika should take steps during and after they travel to prevent mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika .     Q: What can people do to prevent Zika?  A: The best way to prevent Zika is to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites:  Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents  Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.  Zika can be spread by a person infected with Zika to his or her sex partners. Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex. Condoms include male and female condoms. To be effective, condoms should be used from start to finish, every time during vaginal, anal, and oral sex and the sharing of sex toys. Not having sex eliminates the risk of getting Zika from sex. Pregnant couples with a partner who traveled to or lives in an area with risk of Zika should use condoms every time they have sex or not have sex during the pregnancy.     Q: What are the symptoms of Zika virus disease?  A: The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika won’t have symptoms or will have mild symptoms, which can last for several days to a week.     Q: How is Zika diagnosed?  A: To diagnose Zika, your doctor will ask you about recent travel and symptoms you may have, and collect blood or urine to test for Zika or similar viruses.     Q: Can someone who returned from an area with risk of Zika get tested for the virus?  A: Zika virus testing is performed at CDC and some state and territorial health departments. See your doctor if you have Zika symptoms and have recently been in an area with risk of Zika . Your doctor may order tests to look for Zika or similar viruses like dengue and chikungunya.     Q: What should pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika do?  A: Pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika should talk to their doctor about their travel, even if they don’t feel sick. Pregnant women should see a doctor if they have any Zika symptoms during their trip or after traveling. All pregnant women can protect themselves by avoiding travel to an area with risk of Zika, preventing mosquito bites , and following recommended precautions against getting Zika through sex .     Q: I am not pregnant, but will my future pregnancies be at risk if I am infected with Zika virus?  A: Currently, there is no evidence that a woman who has recovered from Zika virus infection (the virus has cleared her body) will have Zika-related pregnancy complications in the future. Based on information about similar infections, once a person has been infected with Zika virus and has cleared the virus from his or her body, he or she is likely to be protected from future Zika infections.  If you’re thinking about having a baby in the near future and you or your partner live in or traveled to an area with risk of Zika , talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider. See Women & Their Partners Trying to Become Pregnant .     Q: I was in a place with risk of Zika recently. How long do I need to wait after returning to get pregnant?  A: Men who have traveled to a place with a CDC Zika travel notice or a red area of Zika active transmission in the United States should wait at least 6 months after travel (or 6 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to conceive with their partner. Women should wait at least 8 weeks after travel (or 8 weeks after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to get pregnant. The waiting period is longer for men because Zika stays in semen longer than in other body fluids. Travelers to areas with risk of Zika but no CDC Zika travel notice should talk to their healthcare provider. Travelers to yellow Zika cautionary areas can consider waiting these timeframes before trying to conceive. If either partner has symptoms of Zika or tests positive for Zika after travel, they should follow the suggested timeframes above before trying to get pregnant.     Q: Which insect repellents work best to prevent infections caused by mosquito bites?  A: To prevent Zika and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents on exposed skin. The insect repellent should include one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. Always follow the label instructions when using insect repellent.     Q: How should insect repellents be used on children to prevent mosquito bites and the viruses that some mosquitoes can spread?  A: You should not use insect repellents on babies younger than 2 months old. Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old. Do not apply insect repellent onto a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin. Adults should spray insect repellent onto their hands and then apply to a child’s face. Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.     Q: Is it safe for infants or children to travel to an area with risk of Zika?  A: CDC’s travel guidance for areas with risk of Zika applies to infants and children, as well as adults. CDC recommends that those who travel to areas with risk of Zika protect themselves from mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning from travel. For safe and effective ways to protect your child from mosquito bites, please visit CDC’s Zika prevention page . Most children infected with Zika virus have no symptoms or have a mild illness, similar to adults with Zika virus infection.     Q: What should I do if I am sick, or a family member is sick, with Zika?  A: Many people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms lasting several days to a week. If you have symptoms of Zika (fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain) and you live in or recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika , you should see your doctor or healthcare provider and tell him or her about your symptoms and recent travel. There is no specific medicine for Zika, but you can treat the symptoms . If you are diagnosed with Zika, protect those around you by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites and to prevent sexual transmission of Zika. Because Zika can generally be found in blood during approximately the first week of infection and can be passed to another person through mosquito bites, help prevent others from getting sick by strictly following steps to prevent mosquito bites during the first week of illness.     Q: Should we be concerned about Zika in the United States?  A: Local mosquito-borne spread of Zika has been reported in the continental United States. CDC has guidance for people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County, Florida , and Brownsville, Texas .  Many areas in the United States have the type of mosquitoes that can become infected with and spread Zika virus. Everyone can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, staying in places with air conditioning and window and door screens, treating clothing and gear with permethrin, and using EPA-registered insect repellents that contain one of the following ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone.     Q: What is CDC doing about Zika?  A: CDC is working around the clock to respond to the Zika virus outbreak. CDC’s work includes developing laboratory tests to diagnose Zika, conducting studies to learn more about Zika, publishing reports about Zika, monitoring and reporting cases of Zika, providing guidance to travelers and Americans living in areas with outbreaks, providing on-the-ground support in countries and US territories with current Zika outbreaks, and more.

Hide Caption 29 of 29 Story highlights Only 1 in 5 people will develop any symptoms; symptoms are typically mild and temporary There is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection (CNN) The Zika virus was discovered nearly 70 years ago, but chances are you probably hadn't heard of it until the past few months. With fear and uncertainty spreading as quickly as the virus itself, CNN Health wanted to address some of your pressing questions on the topic. To stay informed on the latest Zika news and most up-to-date information, bookmark: CNN.com/Zika . Should I be worried about Zika? The Zika virus is part of the same family as yellow fever , West Nile , chikungunya and dengue . But there is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection. Read More Even though symptoms are most often mild, Zika is commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly , a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. It causes severe developmental issues and, in some cases, can result in death. What are the chances I'll get the Zika virus? The virus is most commonly transmitted when an Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a person with an active infection and then spreads the virus by biting others. Originally discovered in a Ugandan forest, the aggressive mosquito is now predominantly raising concerns in Central and South America. If there are no infected mosquitoes in your area, you're very unlikely to contract the disease. Zika has been sexually transmitted in Texas, CDC confirms On February 2, the CDC confirmed the first case of sexually transmitted Zika in the latest outbreak. A male patient who had recently returned from Venezuela infected with Zika returned to the United States and infected his sexual partner, who had not traveled. The CDC issued interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus and noted that "there have been no reports of sexual transmission of Zika virus from infected women to their sex partners." "Until we know more, if your male sexual partner has traveled to or lives in an area with active Zika virus transmission, you should abstain from sex or use condoms the right way every time you have vaginal, anal and oral sex for the duration of the pregnancy," the updated guidance says. CDC issues new safe-sex guidelines around Zika virus While the virus has been documented in breast milk, saliva and urine, it has not yet been confirmed if the virus can be transmitted through any bodily fluids other than blood. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta , "There have been isolated cases of spread through blood transfusion or sexual contact and that's not very surprising. The virus is in the blood for about a week. How long it would remain in the semen is something that needs to be studied and we're working on that now." Frieden said that studies on sexual transmission are not easy studies to do, but the CDC is continuing to explore that avenue of transmission. "What we know is the vast majority of spread is going to be from mosquitoes," Frieden said. "The bottom line is mosquitoes are the real culprit here." What are the symptoms and effects? Only about one in five people infected with Zika virus will actually become ill, according to the CDC . "The most common symptoms of Zika are fever are rash, joint pain or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other symptoms include muscle pain and headache," the CDC says. For most people, the illness is mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. People don't usually get sick enough to require a hospital visit, and the virus very rarely results in death. JUST WATCHED What is the Zika virus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the Zika virus?  01:32 More seriously, Zika has been linked the birth defect microcephaly, as well as Guillain-Barré , a rare syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves. It's important to note: a link does not necessarily indicate cause and effect. Aside from either of these conditions, there are no lasting, long-term effects of Zika. Additionally, once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections, according to the CDC. What should I do if I think I've been exposed? If you think you may have been exposed to the Zika virus, stop and ask yourself these three questions: 1. Are you pregnant? 2. Are you a woman who is thinking about getting pregnant? 3. Are you a man who is going to have unprotected sex with a woman who is pregnant or may become pregnant? If your answer to all of these questions is "no," there is arguably no reason for you to get tested. Remember, only 20% people who contract the virus will even develop any symptoms, and those who do will experience only mild and short-lived discomfort. If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, however, you should contact your doctor about being tested for Zika. He or she can order blood tests to look for Zika or other similar viral diseases, such as dengue or chikungunya. A blood test performed in a clinical setting is the only way to be definitively diagnosed. How I can I be treated if I have the Zika virus? Unfortunately, as of now, there is no vaccine or specific medicine to treat Zika virus infections. Instead, the CDC recommends treating the symptoms: -- Get plenty of rest. -- Drink fluids to prevent dehydration. -- Take medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce fever and pain. -- Do not take aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If you are taking medicine for another medical condition, talk to your health care provider before taking additional medication. How can I keep myself safe in the U.S. or abroad? How to keep away mosquitoes carrying Zika, dengue With no vaccine available, the only protection against Zika is to avoid traveling to areas with an active infestation. If you do travel to a country where Zika is present, the CDC advises strict adherence to mosquito protection measures: Use an EPA-approved repellent over sunscreen, wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts thick enough to block a mosquito bite, and sleep in an air-conditioned, screened room. If you have Zika, you can keep from spreading it to others by avoiding mosquito bites during the first week of illness, the CDC said. The female Aedes aegypti, the primary carrier of Zika, is an aggressive biter, preferring daytime to dusk and indoors to outdoors. Keeping screens on windows and doors is critical to preventing entry to homes and hotel rooms.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She added, “We’ve become more concerned” about the period around the time of conception. “For people who either have the Zika disease or who travel to an area with active Zika transmission, we are now recommending they wait a period of time before trying to get pregnant.”     Zika Virus Rumors and Theories That You Should Doubt  Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.             For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE At least 10 percent of babies born to women infected with Zika virus have been diagnosed with visible birth defects, federal researchers reported Tuesday. And 15 percent of women infected during the first trimester of pregnancy end up with affected babies, the team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE In Texas, Pregnant and Scared of Zika 02:32 That’s just visible defects. Some of the babies may have subtler birth defects that will only be seen as they grow, the CDC team said. It’s the latest and most complete look at the risk that Zika poses to pregnant women and their babies, and it shows the risk is high. “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States,” CDC acting director Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters. So far, 1,600 women infected with Zika are or have been pregnant in the 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. Related: Zika Raises Birth Defect Rate 20 Times “We do know this devastating outbreak is far from over and the consequences of this outbreak are heartbreaking.” More than 1,000 pregnant women who tested positive for Zika virus or had suspected Zika infections either gave birth, had a miscarriage or an abortion in 2016. The CDC team and state health officials took a detailed look at the cases. “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States." “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States." Of all the women, 51 of the women or 5 percent had a baby with some sort of Zika-related birth defect, ranging from microcephaly — the small head that’s the hallmark of Zika and that’s caused by brain damage — to other brain damage or neurological birth defect. Among women whose Zika was confirmed by lab test, 10 percent had a baby or fetus with a Zika-related birth defect. “That proportion increased to 15 percent for women with confirmed Zika during their first trimester,” Schuchat said. The last estimate showed 6 percent of babies or fetuses were affected. That’s probably not the full range of damage, Schuchat added. “Some seemingly healthy babies born following pregnancies complicated by Zika may have developmental problems that become evident months after birth,” she said. Zika is known to cause a range of birth defects . The first to be noticed was microcephaly, but now doctors have seen other profound defects, such as collapsed skulls and other deformities, as well as milder problems, such as eye defects. Related:  Zika-Affected Babies Can Cry 24 Hours a Day “Some babies may have seizures while other babies may have problems controlling their arms and legs,” Schuchat said. “Some babies cry constantly and are inconsolable no matter what their caregiver does,” she added. Others have trouble swallowing or controlling their arms and legs. It could cost $4 million or more to care for a Zika-affected child, the CDC estimates. Zika is mostly carried by travelers to the United States, but the virus has been spread in Florida by local mosquitoes, and there have been a few home-grown cases in south Texas, as well. Any place that has the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika could see local outbreaks. Before Zika, the birth defect rate in the U.S. was about 2.9 per 1,000 live births. “The initial findings from the U.S. Zika virus pregnancy registry represent an approximate twentyfold increase in Zika virus–associated birth defects among pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection, with an approximate thirtyfold increase in brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly,” the CDC and state researchers wrote in their report. “Every mosquito bite carries a risk." “Every mosquito bite carries a risk." Pregnant women or women who could become pregnant should stay away from any place where Zika is spreading, the CDC and World Health Organization says. If they cannot stay away, they should use insect repellent, clothing and other measures to prevent mosquito bites, and condoms to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. Related: Study to Track 10,000 Pregnant Women And pregnant women with any chance of Zika infection need regular scans to see if their baby is affected — and any babies born need an ultrasound or CT scan to check for birth defects. Only 25 percent of the women whose babies were affected got those scans, the CDC said. It’s not clear why not — it could be a health insurance issue — Schuchat said the CDC also believes that all doctors still do not understand the need for such scans. “These findings underscore the serious risk for birth defects posed by Zika virus infection during pregnancy and highlight why pregnant women should avoid Zika virus exposure and that all pregnant women should be screened for possible Zika virus exposure at every prenatal visit,” the CDC team, led by Dr. Margaret Honein, wrote. “Zika is still with us. We don’t know how much transmission there will be this year,” Schuchat said. “Every mosquito bite carries a risk,” she added. “We cannot afford to be complacent when a single bite from a Zika-affected mosquito can lead to such a devastating condition.” Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Why? A sudden surge in Brazilian babies born with microcephaly – a birth defect caused by the Zika infection during pregnancy – sparked massive concern and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a public health emergency. The disease is also linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis.  But there’s an added twist that makes this situation even more complex: Brazil, the country at the center of the current Zika crisis, is slated to host nearly 500,000 visitors this summer. Media attention on the problem has exploded, and experts are even debating whether visitors and athletes should make the trip.  At Casino.org, we’re very familiar with odds – so we decided to calculate the likelihood of the average person contracting Zika this summer in Rio. How does the risk of Zika compare with the risk of other illnesses and accidents? What percentage of the U.S. population currently has the disease? And what are the real odds of catching Zika in Rio this summer? Is the Zika/Rio debate truly a global health crisis – or a case of media hype? Read on to get the full story.    What Do You Have a Greater Chance of Dying From?  So you’ve booked your flight to Rio, and planned your accommodations. What’s the likelihood that you’ll make it back home without catching Zika? Pretty decent: 99.999996 percent.   Another way to gain perspective is to compare your 0.000004 percent chance of contracting Zika in Rio this summer with the odds of dying from various other conditions. Only one person has died in the continental U.S. from Zika as of July 11. You are more than twice as likely to die from legal execution, 73 times more likely to die from choking on food, and over 2,212 times more likely to die in an automobile crash than to even contract Zika in Rio.     How Many Times More Likely Is ...  Should you head to Brazil this summer, you can rest easy when it comes to worrying about Zika: You only have a 1 in 250,000 chance of contracting the virus. By our reckoning, you have a lot more to worry about before you stress about that.   You're thousands of times more likely to die from an auto accident than you are likely to contract Zika in Rio. You’re also hundreds of times more likely to die from a shooting or drowning. Even the most random fatal accidents are more probable: Falling, air accidents, and even lightning strikes should worry you more than contracting Zika.     Zika Infections Across the Country  Zika is making headlines across the United States and around the globe – so we took a look at actual known cases of the virus among people within the United States . First of all, every known case of Zika in the U.S. is associated with travel to an outbreak area or sex with an infected person – there are no known cases of Zika caused by a mosquito bite on American soil as of July 11.  Washington, D.C., tops the list for highest percentage of Zika cases: 0.000893 percent of the population has contracted the disease. New York, Hawaii, and Florida have the next highest rates. In five states – Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, and Alaska – there are no known cases of Zika at all.     Comparing Zika With Ebola, Malaria, and Other Diseases  Zika is constantly being discussed in the media, but how does it compare to other buzzed-about diseases? In the past decade, Ebola, malaria, and the West Nile virus have had just as much media coverage. In 2014, the United States was in an Ebola panic , and many were afraid they would contract Ebola.   While it’s 53 times more likely a resident of the United States will contract Zika over Ebola, those odds were during Ebola’s peak in 2014 and the Zika odds require a trip to Rio this summer. Here in the U.S., your odds of contracting Ebola and Zika are slim, and you are much more likely of contracting a severe form of West Nile disease or even malaria. Your best bet? Wear bug spray and see a doctor if you display any symptoms.    Contracting Zika or Dengue Fever in Rio  As we’ve discovered, the likelihood of contracting Zika this summer isn’t particularly high. It’s much more likely you’d catch a cold or some other common illness from someone beside you in the stands. But what about another mosquito-borne disease?  Dengue fever is a major risk for people who reside in the tropics and subtropics. It is a leading cause of illness and even death in those regions. No vaccine exists, so the best protection is to simply avoid mosquito bites.   Of the nearly half a million projected visitors to Rio this summer, odds are that only two may contract Zika. On the other hand, chances are that about 279 Rio visitors could contract dengue fever.     What Else Is More Likely?  Asteroids. UFOs. Four-leaf clovers. They’re the stuff of dreams – or in some cases, nightmares. But, amazingly, you’re likelier to encounter one of these than you are to become a victim of Zika. For instance, a person is 25 times likelier to find a four-leaf clover on their first try than to contract Zika in Rio this summer.   In addition, a woman in the United States is 8 times more likely to spot a UFO than to give birth to a baby with microcephaly as a result of Zika contracted in Rio.    Calculating the Odds  As you can see, the odds of contracting Zika in Rio this summer are astronomically slim. However, the debate rages on .   Zika is a serious disease, and even one case is a case too many. However, of those who become infected, 8 in 10 don’t even display symptoms, and the remaining 2 in 10 usually aren’t ill enough to require medical treatment. Zika’s greatest danger, by far, is to pregnant women.  It’s always important to do the research, weigh the risks, and calculate the odds.

For women living in areas where the mosquito-borne virus is spreading, who are trying to make the huge decision of whether, and when, to have a child, there’s not a lot to go on. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women who’ve gotten Zika should wait at least eight weeks to conceive, and that men who’ve gotten it should wait at least six months. But the vast majority of people who are infected with Zika don’t show any symptoms, and children can still be born with birth defects and mothers can still miscarry, even if they never had symptoms. So it’s possible that microcephaly—a birth defect caused by Zika that leads to smaller-than-average head size and other developmental problems—could sneak up on parents who never knew one of them had Zika in the first place. Margaret Chan, the director of the World Health Organization, summed up the harsh reality of the situation in her recent address to the 69th World Health Assembly : “To protect women of childbearing age, all we can offer is advice. Avoid mosquito bites. Delay pregnancy. Do not travel to areas with ongoing transmission.” If a woman is infected in her first trimester, there is between a 1 and 13 percent chance of her fetus developing microcephaly. This is not the most reassuring advice. But a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates how likely it is that the fetus of a woman infected with Zika would develop microcephaly, offering would-be parents at least some idea of the risk they’d be taking on. Analyzing current outbreak data from the Brazilian state of Bahia, researchers from the CDC calculated that if a woman is infected in her first trimester, there is between a 1  and 13 percent chance of her fetus developing microcephaly. Related Stories      Zika Is a Delayed Epidemic   When in Pregnancy Is Zika Most Dangerous?   The Count of American Zika Cases Just Got Bigger   That’s a big range! We have Zika’s stealthy nature to thank for that. The first number is based on the assumption that the Zika infection rate in Bahia’s population is 80 percent and that half the cases of microcephaly reported are false. The second presumes a 10 percent infection rate and that every case reported is true. There’s probably been at least some overreporting of microcephaly in Brazil, and since many people don’t show symptoms and don’t get tested, the actual infection rate is hard to pin down. So we don’t know where in that range the truth lies. A previous analysis of the 2013-2014 Zika outbreak in French Polynesia found about a 1 percent risk—but the microcephaly cases there were found retrospectively, so that might be on the low side. Some important caveats—this study only looked at first-trimester infection, and infection at all stages of pregnancy has been associated with fetal abnormalities and other pregnancy problems. And it also only looked at microcephaly specifically. “Microcephaly is only one possible adverse outcome among a spectrum of conditions that may be part of congenital Zika syndrome,” the researchers write. Still, at least we now have a risk estimate to offer women, along with advice.

Twitter                 Most Popular  Presented by               Jonathan Ernst / Reuters   Michael Cohen Has a Big Problem    Adam Serwer    It takes strong evidence to execute a search warrant against an attorney representing a subject in a federal investigation, let alone the president’s personal counsel.   Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.   Continue Reading                Alana Semuels / The Atlantic   A House You Can Buy, But Never Own    Alana Semuels      African Americans in the same neighborhoods decimated by subprime lending are now being targeted with new predatory loan offerings, a lawsuit argues.   ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

Robinson Meyer      How to find out if you are one of the 87 million victims   Facebook has begun to notify users who were affected by the Cambridge Analytica data breach. If you or one of your friends installed the personality-quiz app “This Is Your Digital Life” prior to 2015, then some of your data illicitly made it to the servers of the voter-profiling company.  If your data was ensnared in the breach, you’re not alone. I’m also one of Cambridge Analytica’s victims. (If you’re not sure whether you were affected, you can go to this Facebook page , which will tell you if your information was shared.)  I know I was affected by the breach because I saw a big text box when I opened the Facebook app on my phone this morning.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.

Madrigal      Inside Uber’s latest attempt to rebuild its app for drivers, the biggest experiment in the gig economy.   Every day, the world’s 3 million Uber drivers spend 8.5 million hours logged into the ride-hailing company’s app. That’s roughly 1,000 years of Uber driving packed into any given 24 hours.  Because of this tremendous scale, Uber is the most important test case for the gig economy, the new economic arrangement where contract workers are arranged into a cohesive labor force by software. There are many companies that share Uber’s controversial approach to doling out work, but none has amassed 3 million people who use the service to try to make money. Never before has an app’s design been so important to so many people.  The Uber app is the drivers’ workplace, as much as the city where they’re driving is. Each decision about its interface structures drivers’ interactions with Uber the company as well as Uber the transportation marketplace. And Uber is now putting the finishing touches on a from-scratch rebuild of the driver app.    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

Lourdes Health System    Administration         Your risk of contracting the Zika virus is very, very low. In fact, many people who contract Zika may not even realize it. So far, there is no mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika virus within the United States, so most screening efforts are looking to see if a person has traveled to an area where it is endemic. Zika is contracted by mosquitoes in Puerto Rico and Central and South America. So, doctors are screening for Zika to see if a person or a sexual partner has been in one of these territories. The tricky part is that the incubation time of the virus is between three and seven days. So, you might come back from a vacation or a conference and show no signs yet.

Univ. of Nev. School of Medicine, Family Medicine    Family Medicine         Your chance, or risk, of getting Zika depends on where you live or travel. The Zika virus has been seen in Mexico, Central America, South America, Puerto Rico and on several Caribbean islands. Anyone traveling to these areas may come in contact with the Zika virus. You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites. In the U.S, the Zika virus has so far been found only in limited areas in Florida, although people who have come in contact with the virus elsewhere have returned to country with the infection. (This is called a travel-associated case.)                   Khang N. Tran, MD on behalf of Medical City Plano    Internal Medicine         Only 1 in 5 people bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika will actually get Zika. A person may not become infected -- possibly because their immune system was on overdrive that day, or the amount of the virus carried by the mosquito was very small.

Here’s what you need to know about the Zika virus.  Friday, June 30  A programming note  This will be the final weekly edition of Zika in 30 Seconds. Thank you for reading as, over the last 17 months, we’ve tracked the developing science, the progress toward a vaccine, and the many questions still unanswered about Zika virus.  advertisement        Still, our coverage of Zika will continue. Going forward we’ll use this space to alert you to important news about Zika as it arises — so stay tuned.  And for more regular updates about Zika, follow STAT’s senior writer for global health Helen Branswell on Twitter .  On people’s lips  “The fight against Zika virus is not a 100-m race, but rather a marathon in which science and public health need to work hand in hand for the benefit of our peoples.” — Carissa F. Etienne , director of Pan American Health Organization  What lies ahead  The dramatic global rise of Zika in 2016 was followed by an equally dramatic decline by the end of that year — the reasons for which epidemiologists are still sorting out. But, global health expert Dr. Peter Hotez writes , “While countries such as Brazil no longer seem to be sustaining new transmission, there are new foci popping up in additional Latin American countries, including Ecuador and Peru on the Pacific Coast of South America, as well as in Argentina and Bolivia.”  In the U.S., he says, Florida seems less at risk this year than it was last year, when the state saw more than 200 cases of local Zika transmission.  But, Hotez writes, spread of the virus in Mexico may mean that local cases in Texas crop up later this year.  The bottom line, he says? We’re in a “new normal” for Zika and other similar viruses, both in the U.S. and globally.     Friday, June 23  What’s new this week     The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it would fund a study in Guatemala to determine whether Zika virus is capable of attacking the still-developing brains of newborns. ( STAT )    Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which can carry Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, are more common across the United States than previously believed, federal experts reported. ( NBC News )    The claim that six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, had contracted Zika, was retracted. ( Houston Chronicle )    When seeking a diagnosis    Testing for Zika virus RNA in placental tissue can confirm Zika infection when the mother’s blood tests are inconclusive, according to a new study. The authors emphasize that clinicians should continue to consider testing for Zika RNA when a definitive diagnosis has not been reached. ( Medscape )    Today’s must-read    A clinic mix-up leaves pregnant woman in dark about Zika risk. ( Kaiser Health News )       Friday, June 16  What’s new this week     A group of Florida lawmakers is urging the U.S. Army to hold a hearing on its plan to give Sanofi an exclusive license to develop a Zika virus vaccine, a move that has raised concerns the product may be priced too high for many Americans, even though it was developed with taxpayer funds. ( STAT )    Six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, have tested positive for Zika, the first cases of the mosquito-borne disease to be reported in the area in 2017. ( Houston Chronicle )    Learning the hard way    When Zika struck last year, officials in Miami-Dade County immediately began fogging with permethrin, the active ingredient in home bug-killers such as Raid. Permethrin was sprayed at least seven times, but by the end of August, the county realized the poison had little effect and stopped using it. Officials didn’t get around to testing which pesticides kill Aedes aegypti until October — midway through Zika season. ( Miami New Times )    Today’s must-read    Zika in America: One mother’s saga ( Kaiser Health News )     Friday, June 9  What’s new this week   A new CDC report quantifies Zika’s toll on pregnancies in U.S. territories. Five percent of Zika-affected pregnancies resulted in birth defects, researchers found, and the risk was highest in the first trimester, declining each trimester after ( New York Times )  Health concerns about the pesticide naled — used in Florida and elsewhere to battle Zika — were again raised by a new study. Higher concentrations of naled in the cord blood of Chinese infants was correlated with impaired motor skills at age 9 months ( Miami Herald )   Inside STAT: Fading from view  The public’s sense of alarm over the Zika outbreak has subsided — posing a challenge to health officials who want to keep it on the radar of the people who need to pay attention. Puerto Rico declared its outbreak over this week; Brazil said its emergency was over in May. In the United States, summer approaches with little discussion of the virus outside public health circles. But the risk to pregnant women traveling abroad is still real, and not going to change anytime soon. Read more .  Today’s must-read   A Washington state mother on the challenges of raising a daughter with microcephaly ( Newsworks )    Friday, June 2  What’s new this week   The WHO last Friday announced India’s first three cases of the Zika virus, including two pregnant women — but since then questions have been brewing. More on that below. ( WHO )  A new Discovery Channel documentary about mosquito-borne diseases, slated to air July 6, will feature Jeremy Renner as narrator ( The Hollywood Reporter )  Zika testing in May rose to levels not seen since last August, according to EHR vendor athenahealth ( Healthcare IT News )   India’s Zika silence  In the wake of India’s disclosure last month to the WHO that it had detected three cases of Zika, a number of questions have been raised about why the cases weren’t announced months ago. The Washington Post reports that health ministers said they knew about the country’s first case of Zika back in November of 2016, but they didn’t alert the public because they didn’t want “people to start panicking.” Meanwhile, The Wire points out, the country’s disease surveillance index still says zero cases of Zika have been found in the country, and the WHO has moved India up from the safest category 4 to category 2 in its ranking of Zika risk.  How microcephaly happens  A new paper sheds further light on why the Zika virus takes its most dramatic toll on the developing brain: Because a protein found in those cells helps the virus reproduce. The protein, called Musashi-1, is found in high levels in precursors to neurons — but if Zika virus is present it acts like a sponge, depriving the neurons of the protein. In fact, one family with a congenital mutation in the Musashi-1 gene has two children with microcephaly, the researchers point out, adding further evidence that this protein is key to normal brain development. That discovery may hopefully help scientists devise a way to stop the damage from occurring.  Today’s must-read   US taxpayers are funding a Zika vaccine. Let’s make sure US patients can afford it ( STAT )    Friday, May 26  What’s new this week   Sequencing the genome of Zika virus has indicated that in almost every affected country, Zika was circulating for months — or even years — before the first cases were reported ( The Atlantic )  Though good news for the broader population, a drop in Zika cases in Latin America has made it hard for research studies on the virus to recruit enough participants to have meaningful results ( Nature )  By removing protections for preexisting conditions, the GOP health bill may make insurance prohibitively expensive both for pregnant women who have had Zika and for infants born with microcephaly ( Mother Jones )   Response, in retrospect  The GAO this week released a report on the US government’s response to the Zika epidemic, concluding that the CDC and many states were underprepared to battle the outbreak. The report finds that the federal government could do better specifically on distributing and regulating diagnostic tests and on communicating geographic risk of the virus. The steps that the report concludes that the HHS should take are:   Establish a transparent process to provide CDC diagnostic tests, upon request, to manufacturers that are in the final stages of diagnostic test authorization.  Include information on CDC-developed tests distributed to or shared with public health laboratories on CDC’s website, including laboratory developed tests.  Provide details such as collection records, dates, and data limitations on posted and disseminated mosquito distribution maps to better inform mosquito control experts and the general public.  Consolidate information from individual diagnostic test labels and make this information available in a form that enables users to more readily compare information across tests.  Require manufacturers to list the identity of comparator assays on their diagnostic test labels.   A startling case study  A recently published case study describes an American adolescent who contracted Zika on a trip to the Caribbean. Symptoms of sore throat, headache, rash, and joint pain resolved soon after the individual returned to the US, but a range of worrying psychiatric symptoms — including “excessive energy, decreased sleep, rapid and tangential speech, grandiose thinking, impulsivity, and decreased inhibition” — stuck around for weeks afterward and even necessitated a period of hospitalization. Fifteen weeks after symptom onset, doctors reported, the patient’s symptoms were better but not gone. All told, they write, the case “raise[s] the possibility that Zika virus infection may trigger neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.”  Today’s must-read   ‘I taught them to love Valentina as I do’: Mother’s faith guides struggle to care for daughter with microcephaly ( Milwaukee Journal Sentinel )    Friday, May 19  What’s new this week   Cuba had one of the most successful Zika-reduction campaigns in Latin America last year — but even so, the virus is taking a toll there. Health officials said this week that 1,847 residents have so far contracted the virus, the first such information out of the country in months. It’s unclear how many of those cases were locally transmitted ( Reuters )  Sanofi Pasteur has rejected a request from the US Army to set an affordable US price for a Zika vaccine that the company is developing with American taxpayer funds, prompting an angry response from Senator Bernie Sanders ( STAT )   Fighting cancer with Zika?  Studying Zika’s tragic effects on fetuses has revealed two key qualities of the virus: It can cross the blood-brain barrier, and it specifically targets the developing brain. Now scientists are wondering whether those qualities might make the virus a cancer-killer . A newly funded research project in the UK will examine, in cells and in mice, whether Zika virus can selectively attack and kill brain cancer cells.  A key challenge of delivering drugs to the brain is the blood-brain barrier, which prohibits many molecules from passing into the brain — but Zika appears to be able to pass. What’s more, glioblastoma cells — a highly lethal form of brain cancer — resemble fetal brain cells in a number of ways. Combining those two lines of reasoning, scientists are now embarking on a project to see how Zika interacts with the cancer.   Friday, May 12  What’s new this week   Brazil today declared an end to national emergency status for Zika virus. The number of cases in the country dropped 95 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period a year ago, officials said ( BBC )  In an effort to kill mosquito larvae near homes, residents of one Florida county can get free “mosquito fish” at their local library ( ABC )  The costs, just in the near term, of Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean could be $18 billion, according to a new study. That amount covers just 2015-2017 and it is the upper bound of a wide range of possibilities, depending on rates of transmission ( press release )   Testing advice changes for pregnant women  The CDC is now suggesting that women thinking of getting pregnant, and who may be exposed to the Zika virus, should consider having their blood tested for Zika antibodies before they get pregnant . That’s because IgM, a type of antibody triggered by Zika infection, can stick around in the blood for months, and doctors can’t always tell if the infection happened before pregnancy — which poses no risk to the fetus — or during pregnancy, when it’s a high risk. To distinguish those two scenarios, women at risk of exposure should ideally be tested before pregnancy and again each trimester.   Friday, May 5  What’s new this week   The Prevention and Public Health Fund, which would be eliminated under the health bill that passed the House this week, provides a significant chunk of the CDC’s budget — including funding efforts to fight Zika ( STAT , NASHP )  Miami-Dade County has spent about $25 million on battling Zika so far, officials say ( Miami Herald )   Rift between Puerto Rico and CDC  Of all the states and territories, US health officials last year were especially worried about Zika’s potential impacts in Puerto Rico — which was part of their motivation to create the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System to track pregnant women and identify infants and fetuses with Zika-related birth defects. The CDC awarded Puerto Rico’s Department of Health $9.5 million for the project. But since then the agencies have had a protracted feud, a document obtained by STAT shows, with the CDC claiming that health officials disregarded the established case definition for identifying affected infants — creating the illusion of far fewer affected infants than there may in fact be.

The measure now goes to the full Senate ( Miami Herald )  The US Army is proceeding with plans to grant Sanofi Pasteur an exclusive license to develop a Zika vaccine, despite some groups’ concerns that the product may be priced too high for many Americans ( STAT Plus )   Number of the day: 15 percent  The upper estimate of how much live births in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, fell during the second half of 2016. Scientists don’t yet know why, but suspect that a combination of family planning and Zika-caused miscarriages are to blame. ( New Scientist )  One year later  Since the beginning of the Zika epidemic in 2015, doctors have realized that Zika congenital syndrome can manifest itself in profound ways — brain tissue missing — or subtler deficits, such as hearing loss and vision problems. STAT recently revisited two affected babies — Duda, age 18 months, and Sophia, 1 year — whose divergent stories show the varied effects of the virus, and its profound impacts upon families.

And more than 3,300 pregnant women there are known to have contracted the virus. But the number of babies born in Puerto Rico with microcephaly and other birth defects caused by Zika is unexpectedly low — just 16 cases — which is leading experts to question whether the island territory is downplaying its Zika spread, possibly to protect its tourism industry.   2 more babies have been born in the US with #Zika -induced birth defects. So far 65 pregnancies have been affected.

But it didn’t materialize — and researchers have been trying to figure out why. A new paper offers a theory : The authors suggest the region’s first wave of Zika may have been its only wave of Zika to date. Illnesses in 2016, by that reckoning, were caused by a different virus producing lookalike symptoms to Zika — likely the chikungunya virus — but not causing microcephaly. In some ways, that’s good news; it might suggest Zika outbreaks are swift. But it doesn’t mean the virus is done. More likely, said senior author Christopher Dye, is that Zika will return after births create pools of people who have no immunity to the virus, hitting perhaps when people aren’t expecting it.

But in addition to that, there’s a more specific provision that would threaten Zika funding directly, points out Ed Yong at the Atlantic : A halving of the budget for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) program. That program helps state public health laboratories train their staff and buy equipment; these labs are in many cases the ones running blood tests for Zika. When, for instance, Congress failed for months to fund a Zika response last year, Minnesota’s public health laboratory used ELC funds to begin its public testing. With half as much funding, researchers say, being prepared for the next public health threat will be much harder.

The Washington Post reports:  There were two types of solution the District could have purchased to conduct a phase of the test. One bottle came marked with a “D,” for diluted, and the other with a “U”, for undiluted. D.C. lab workers had purchased the diluted version, Tran said, and then mistakenly watered it down as if it was the more concentrated one, weakening the ability to detect for Zika.  That mistake, missed for more than six months, is a worrisome failing — enough so that officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have now audited the lab, the Post reports , to determine how the mistakes were made and whether they’ve been fully rectified.

In one case, a pregnant Las Vegas-area woman has tested positive for Zika, the county’s first non-travel related case. Health officials say she caught the virus via sex; her partner previously tested positive. But, according to local television station KLAS , he was never informed of his test results, in what’s being blamed on a “computer glitch.” It’s not yet clear whether the woman’s fetus has been infected with the virus.  And on the other side of the country, scientists at Washington, D.C.’s public health lab botched Zika tests for more than 400 people from July to December 2016. The “mathematical error” meant that people were getting negative test results when they could have actually been infected. So far officials have identified two pregnant women who were incorrectly told they did not have the virus when in fact they did, reports the Washington Post .

That policy prevents foreign nonprofit groups that receive federal funds from administering abortions or providing abortion counseling or referrals. That could mean a hit to the budget of some nonprofits dealing with Zika, if they continue counseling patients about abortions. What’s more, research has shown that the policy in the past has hampered distribution of contraceptives in affected countries. Family planning and contraception are a key strategy in reducing pregnancies affected by Zika, according to the CDC.

Among the still-unanswered questions, she says:   how the virus infects and interacts with mosquito and human cells;  which are the key genetic and molecular determinants of pathogenesis;  how long the virus persists in human blood and tissues and its transmissibility;  and how the innate and adaptive immune responses can counteract the virus and protect from reinfection.

One, in pregnant Brazilian women with Zika, found a 42 percent likelihood of birth defects; the other, in pregnant American women with Zika, found that birth defects affected just 6 percent. STAT consulted a number of experts and there appears to be no single answer that explains the huge gap — but differences in geography, disease status, and how birth defects are defined could be contributing to the disconnect.

But the question looming over the research is how much demand there will be for a Zika vaccine by the time any of them make it through three rounds of human testing and approval from the FDA. Drug makers are having to consider a range of possibilities — a Zika vaccine being added to a schedule of vaccines given in childhood, simply being marketed to travelers, or perhaps just being stockpiled to protect against a future epidemic — all of which portend different profits.

Here’s what you need to know about the Zika virus.  Friday, June 30  A programming note  This will be the final weekly edition of Zika in 30 Seconds. Thank you for reading as, over the last 17 months, we’ve tracked the developing science, the progress toward a vaccine, and the many questions still unanswered about Zika virus.  advertisement        Still, our coverage of Zika will continue. Going forward we’ll use this space to alert you to important news about Zika as it arises — so stay tuned.  And for more regular updates about Zika, follow STAT’s senior writer for global health Helen Branswell on Twitter .  On people’s lips  “The fight against Zika virus is not a 100-m race, but rather a marathon in which science and public health need to work hand in hand for the benefit of our peoples.” — Carissa F. Etienne , director of Pan American Health Organization  What lies ahead  The dramatic global rise of Zika in 2016 was followed by an equally dramatic decline by the end of that year — the reasons for which epidemiologists are still sorting out. But, global health expert Dr. Peter Hotez writes , “While countries such as Brazil no longer seem to be sustaining new transmission, there are new foci popping up in additional Latin American countries, including Ecuador and Peru on the Pacific Coast of South America, as well as in Argentina and Bolivia.”  In the U.S., he says, Florida seems less at risk this year than it was last year, when the state saw more than 200 cases of local Zika transmission.  But, Hotez writes, spread of the virus in Mexico may mean that local cases in Texas crop up later this year.  The bottom line, he says? We’re in a “new normal” for Zika and other similar viruses, both in the U.S. and globally.     Friday, June 23  What’s new this week     The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it would fund a study in Guatemala to determine whether Zika virus is capable of attacking the still-developing brains of newborns. ( STAT )    Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which can carry Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, are more common across the United States than previously believed, federal experts reported. ( NBC News )    The claim that six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, had contracted Zika, was retracted. ( Houston Chronicle )    When seeking a diagnosis    Testing for Zika virus RNA in placental tissue can confirm Zika infection when the mother’s blood tests are inconclusive, according to a new study. The authors emphasize that clinicians should continue to consider testing for Zika RNA when a definitive diagnosis has not been reached. ( Medscape )    Today’s must-read    A clinic mix-up leaves pregnant woman in dark about Zika risk. ( Kaiser Health News )       Friday, June 16  What’s new this week     A group of Florida lawmakers is urging the U.S. Army to hold a hearing on its plan to give Sanofi an exclusive license to develop a Zika virus vaccine, a move that has raised concerns the product may be priced too high for many Americans, even though it was developed with taxpayer funds. ( STAT )    Six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, have tested positive for Zika, the first cases of the mosquito-borne disease to be reported in the area in 2017. ( Houston Chronicle )    Learning the hard way    When Zika struck last year, officials in Miami-Dade County immediately began fogging with permethrin, the active ingredient in home bug-killers such as Raid. Permethrin was sprayed at least seven times, but by the end of August, the county realized the poison had little effect and stopped using it. Officials didn’t get around to testing which pesticides kill Aedes aegypti until October — midway through Zika season. ( Miami New Times )    Today’s must-read    Zika in America: One mother’s saga ( Kaiser Health News )     Friday, June 9  What’s new this week   A new CDC report quantifies Zika’s toll on pregnancies in U.S. territories. Five percent of Zika-affected pregnancies resulted in birth defects, researchers found, and the risk was highest in the first trimester, declining each trimester after ( New York Times )  Health concerns about the pesticide naled — used in Florida and elsewhere to battle Zika — were again raised by a new study. Higher concentrations of naled in the cord blood of Chinese infants was correlated with impaired motor skills at age 9 months ( Miami Herald )   Inside STAT: Fading from view  The public’s sense of alarm over the Zika outbreak has subsided — posing a challenge to health officials who want to keep it on the radar of the people who need to pay attention. Puerto Rico declared its outbreak over this week; Brazil said its emergency was over in May. In the United States, summer approaches with little discussion of the virus outside public health circles. But the risk to pregnant women traveling abroad is still real, and not going to change anytime soon. Read more .  Today’s must-read   A Washington state mother on the challenges of raising a daughter with microcephaly ( Newsworks )    Friday, June 2  What’s new this week   The WHO last Friday announced India’s first three cases of the Zika virus, including two pregnant women — but since then questions have been brewing. More on that below. ( WHO )  A new Discovery Channel documentary about mosquito-borne diseases, slated to air July 6, will feature Jeremy Renner as narrator ( The Hollywood Reporter )  Zika testing in May rose to levels not seen since last August, according to EHR vendor athenahealth ( Healthcare IT News )   India’s Zika silence  In the wake of India’s disclosure last month to the WHO that it had detected three cases of Zika, a number of questions have been raised about why the cases weren’t announced months ago. The Washington Post reports that health ministers said they knew about the country’s first case of Zika back in November of 2016, but they didn’t alert the public because they didn’t want “people to start panicking.” Meanwhile, The Wire points out, the country’s disease surveillance index still says zero cases of Zika have been found in the country, and the WHO has moved India up from the safest category 4 to category 2 in its ranking of Zika risk.  How microcephaly happens  A new paper sheds further light on why the Zika virus takes its most dramatic toll on the developing brain: Because a protein found in those cells helps the virus reproduce. The protein, called Musashi-1, is found in high levels in precursors to neurons — but if Zika virus is present it acts like a sponge, depriving the neurons of the protein. In fact, one family with a congenital mutation in the Musashi-1 gene has two children with microcephaly, the researchers point out, adding further evidence that this protein is key to normal brain development. That discovery may hopefully help scientists devise a way to stop the damage from occurring.  Today’s must-read   US taxpayers are funding a Zika vaccine. Let’s make sure US patients can afford it ( STAT )    Friday, May 26  What’s new this week   Sequencing the genome of Zika virus has indicated that in almost every affected country, Zika was circulating for months — or even years — before the first cases were reported ( The Atlantic )  Though good news for the broader population, a drop in Zika cases in Latin America has made it hard for research studies on the virus to recruit enough participants to have meaningful results ( Nature )  By removing protections for preexisting conditions, the GOP health bill may make insurance prohibitively expensive both for pregnant women who have had Zika and for infants born with microcephaly ( Mother Jones )   Response, in retrospect  The GAO this week released a report on the US government’s response to the Zika epidemic, concluding that the CDC and many states were underprepared to battle the outbreak. The report finds that the federal government could do better specifically on distributing and regulating diagnostic tests and on communicating geographic risk of the virus. The steps that the report concludes that the HHS should take are:   Establish a transparent process to provide CDC diagnostic tests, upon request, to manufacturers that are in the final stages of diagnostic test authorization.  Include information on CDC-developed tests distributed to or shared with public health laboratories on CDC’s website, including laboratory developed tests.  Provide details such as collection records, dates, and data limitations on posted and disseminated mosquito distribution maps to better inform mosquito control experts and the general public.  Consolidate information from individual diagnostic test labels and make this information available in a form that enables users to more readily compare information across tests.  Require manufacturers to list the identity of comparator assays on their diagnostic test labels.   A startling case study  A recently published case study describes an American adolescent who contracted Zika on a trip to the Caribbean. Symptoms of sore throat, headache, rash, and joint pain resolved soon after the individual returned to the US, but a range of worrying psychiatric symptoms — including “excessive energy, decreased sleep, rapid and tangential speech, grandiose thinking, impulsivity, and decreased inhibition” — stuck around for weeks afterward and even necessitated a period of hospitalization. Fifteen weeks after symptom onset, doctors reported, the patient’s symptoms were better but not gone. All told, they write, the case “raise[s] the possibility that Zika virus infection may trigger neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.”  Today’s must-read   ‘I taught them to love Valentina as I do’: Mother’s faith guides struggle to care for daughter with microcephaly ( Milwaukee Journal Sentinel )    Friday, May 19  What’s new this week   Cuba had one of the most successful Zika-reduction campaigns in Latin America last year — but even so, the virus is taking a toll there. Health officials said this week that 1,847 residents have so far contracted the virus, the first such information out of the country in months. It’s unclear how many of those cases were locally transmitted ( Reuters )  Sanofi Pasteur has rejected a request from the US Army to set an affordable US price for a Zika vaccine that the company is developing with American taxpayer funds, prompting an angry response from Senator Bernie Sanders ( STAT )   Fighting cancer with Zika?  Studying Zika’s tragic effects on fetuses has revealed two key qualities of the virus: It can cross the blood-brain barrier, and it specifically targets the developing brain. Now scientists are wondering whether those qualities might make the virus a cancer-killer . A newly funded research project in the UK will examine, in cells and in mice, whether Zika virus can selectively attack and kill brain cancer cells.  A key challenge of delivering drugs to the brain is the blood-brain barrier, which prohibits many molecules from passing into the brain — but Zika appears to be able to pass. What’s more, glioblastoma cells — a highly lethal form of brain cancer — resemble fetal brain cells in a number of ways. Combining those two lines of reasoning, scientists are now embarking on a project to see how Zika interacts with the cancer.   Friday, May 12  What’s new this week   Brazil today declared an end to national emergency status for Zika virus. The number of cases in the country dropped 95 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period a year ago, officials said ( BBC )  In an effort to kill mosquito larvae near homes, residents of one Florida county can get free “mosquito fish” at their local library ( ABC )  The costs, just in the near term, of Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean could be $18 billion, according to a new study. That amount covers just 2015-2017 and it is the upper bound of a wide range of possibilities, depending on rates of transmission ( press release )   Testing advice changes for pregnant women  The CDC is now suggesting that women thinking of getting pregnant, and who may be exposed to the Zika virus, should consider having their blood tested for Zika antibodies before they get pregnant . That’s because IgM, a type of antibody triggered by Zika infection, can stick around in the blood for months, and doctors can’t always tell if the infection happened before pregnancy — which poses no risk to the fetus — or during pregnancy, when it’s a high risk. To distinguish those two scenarios, women at risk of exposure should ideally be tested before pregnancy and again each trimester.   Friday, May 5  What’s new this week   The Prevention and Public Health Fund, which would be eliminated under the health bill that passed the House this week, provides a significant chunk of the CDC’s budget — including funding efforts to fight Zika ( STAT , NASHP )  Miami-Dade County has spent about $25 million on battling Zika so far, officials say ( Miami Herald )   Rift between Puerto Rico and CDC  Of all the states and territories, US health officials last year were especially worried about Zika’s potential impacts in Puerto Rico — which was part of their motivation to create the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System to track pregnant women and identify infants and fetuses with Zika-related birth defects. The CDC awarded Puerto Rico’s Department of Health $9.5 million for the project. But since then the agencies have had a protracted feud, a document obtained by STAT shows, with the CDC claiming that health officials disregarded the established case definition for identifying affected infants — creating the illusion of far fewer affected infants than there may in fact be.  Today’s must-read   Clues to Zika damage might lie in cases of twins ( New York Times )    Friday, April 28  What’s new this week   No mosquitoes tested in Florida so far this year have been positive for Zika, officials report ( AP )  A US Senate panel this week approved $100 million in mosquito control funding. The measure now goes to the full Senate ( Miami Herald )  The US Army is proceeding with plans to grant Sanofi Pasteur an exclusive license to develop a Zika vaccine, despite some groups’ concerns that the product may be priced too high for many Americans ( STAT Plus )   Number of the day: 15 percent  The upper estimate of how much live births in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, fell during the second half of 2016. Scientists don’t yet know why, but suspect that a combination of family planning and Zika-caused miscarriages are to blame. ( New Scientist )  One year later  Since the beginning of the Zika epidemic in 2015, doctors have realized that Zika congenital syndrome can manifest itself in profound ways — brain tissue missing — or subtler deficits, such as hearing loss and vision problems. STAT recently revisited two affected babies — Duda, age 18 months, and Sophia, 1 year — whose divergent stories show the varied effects of the virus, and its profound impacts upon families.

And more than 3,300 pregnant women there are known to have contracted the virus. But the number of babies born in Puerto Rico with microcephaly and other birth defects caused by Zika is unexpectedly low — just 16 cases — which is leading experts to question whether the island territory is downplaying its Zika spread, possibly to protect its tourism industry.   2 more babies have been born in the US with #Zika -induced birth defects. So far 65 pregnancies have been affected.

Instead of looking for viral RNA, the test looks for antibodies against the virus, which can persist much longer in a person’s blood. Similar tests currently used, however, can be hard to interpret and often need to be confirmed by a CDC laboratory ( press release )  A new type of CRISPR system can detect tiny amounts of Zika and other viruses, presenting a promising avenue for future diagnostic tests ( STAT )  Texas is urging pregnant women in six counties at risk of Zika to be tested for the virus ( NBC )   ICYMI  If you missed seeing photojournalist Katie Falkenberg’s series from Brazil , now’s a good opportunity, as she was one of the finalists for the Pulitzer feature photography category.

The trial began Wednesday at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, one of 11 sites involved in the study ( STAT )  The idea that prior infection with dengue could make people’s Zika infection worse got a boost this week from its first test in mice. Researchers found that mice with West Nile or dengue antibodies were much more likely to die from subsequent Zika infection ( Science News )   Brazil’s Zika mystery  After so many Brazilian babies were born with microcephaly in 2015, the country braced itself for a similar tsunami in 2016. But it didn’t materialize — and researchers have been trying to figure out why. A new paper offers a theory : The authors suggest the region’s first wave of Zika may have been its only wave of Zika to date. Illnesses in 2016, by that reckoning, were caused by a different virus producing lookalike symptoms to Zika — likely the chikungunya virus — but not causing microcephaly. In some ways, that’s good news; it might suggest Zika outbreaks are swift. But it doesn’t mean the virus is done. More likely, said senior author Christopher Dye, is that Zika will return after births create pools of people who have no immunity to the virus, hitting perhaps when people aren’t expecting it.  Today’s must-read   Living with Zika in Puerto Rico means watching, waiting, and fearing judgment ( NPR )    Friday, March 24  What’s new this week   The CDC this week reported an additional 7 US babies born with Zika-related birth defects, bringing the total to 54 ( CDC )  Harris County, Tex., home to Houston, is considering releasing sterile genetically-modified mosquitoes to reduce the insects’ numbers. A similar proposal in the Florida Keys is on hold while residents debate it ( CBS )  An improved genetic technique has pieced together the genome sequence of the mosquito that transmits Zika, Aedes aegypti, 10 years after publication of its draft sequence ( Nature )   Budget concerns  President Trump’s budget released last week contained a provision that would eliminate one-eighth of the CDC’s budget . But in addition to that, there’s a more specific provision that would threaten Zika funding directly, points out Ed Yong at the Atlantic : A halving of the budget for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) program. That program helps state public health laboratories train their staff and buy equipment; these labs are in many cases the ones running blood tests for Zika. When, for instance, Congress failed for months to fund a Zika response last year, Minnesota’s public health laboratory used ELC funds to begin its public testing. With half as much funding, researchers say, being prepared for the next public health threat will be much harder.  Today’s must-read   In pausing human research on Zika, medical ethicists acknowledge a dark past ( WBUR )    Friday, March 17  What’s new this week   Risk of local Zika infection in Florida in 2016 was more extensive than we’d thought. CDC officials said this week that local infections probably started on June 15, as opposed to July 29, and that they occurred in not just Miami-Dade County but also Broward and Palm Beach Counties, home to the major tourist destinations of Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach ( Reuters )   Intimate portraits of Zika families  A deeply reported feature in the New York Times takes a look at some of Brazil’s Zika babies, now a year old but many of them with developmental levels of just a few months. “The children are still small enough to be held, fed and carried,” Pam Belluck writes. “But ultimately, many may be unable to walk, attend regular schools, or live on their own as adults.” That paints a dire future for families who are already barely keeping afloat. Read the full story here , and read a reporter’s notebook from the scene here .  Twitter  Friday, March 10  What’s new this week   The future of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provided some states with funding to fight Zika last year, is in doubt.

That includes spreading pesticide and larvicide, doing on-the-ground inspections, and keeping up with their “mosquito surveillance network” of more than 130 bug traps across the county. So far this year no US residents have contracted Zika from a local mosquito.

The Washington Post reports:  There were two types of solution the District could have purchased to conduct a phase of the test. One bottle came marked with a “D,” for diluted, and the other with a “U”, for undiluted. D.C. lab workers had purchased the diluted version, Tran said, and then mistakenly watered it down as if it was the more concentrated one, weakening the ability to detect for Zika.  That mistake, missed for more than six months, is a worrisome failing — enough so that officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have now audited the lab, the Post reports , to determine how the mistakes were made and whether they’ve been fully rectified.

But before they can be actually deployed they will need to be more affordable ( GeekWire )   Screening scandals  Politics isn’t the only realm that’s seen some shocking headlines this week — Zika has as well.  In one case, a pregnant Las Vegas-area woman has tested positive for Zika, the county’s first non-travel related case. Health officials say she caught the virus via sex; her partner previously tested positive. But, according to local television station KLAS , he was never informed of his test results, in what’s being blamed on a “computer glitch.” It’s not yet clear whether the woman’s fetus has been infected with the virus.  And on the other side of the country, scientists at Washington, D.C.’s public health lab botched Zika tests for more than 400 people from July to December 2016. The “mathematical error” meant that people were getting negative test results when they could have actually been infected. So far officials have identified two pregnant women who were incorrectly told they did not have the virus when in fact they did, reports the Washington Post .

That policy prevents foreign nonprofit groups that receive federal funds from administering abortions or providing abortion counseling or referrals. That could mean a hit to the budget of some nonprofits dealing with Zika, if they continue counseling patients about abortions. What’s more, research has shown that the policy in the past has hampered distribution of contraceptives in affected countries. Family planning and contraception are a key strategy in reducing pregnancies affected by Zika, according to the CDC.

One, in pregnant Brazilian women with Zika, found a 42 percent likelihood of birth defects; the other, in pregnant American women with Zika, found that birth defects affected just 6 percent. STAT consulted a number of experts and there appears to be no single answer that explains the huge gap — but differences in geography, disease status, and how birth defects are defined could be contributing to the disconnect. More studies, in the works now, should shed further light on the true risk.

But the question looming over the research is how much demand there will be for a Zika vaccine by the time any of them make it through three rounds of human testing and approval from the FDA. Drug makers are having to consider a range of possibilities — a Zika vaccine being added to a schedule of vaccines given in childhood, simply being marketed to travelers, or perhaps just being stockpiled to protect against a future epidemic — all of which portend different profits.

Thank you for reading as, over the last 17 months, we’ve tracked the developing science, the progress toward a vaccine, and the many questions still unanswered about Zika virus.  advertisement        Still, our coverage of Zika will continue. Going forward we’ll use this space to alert you to important news about Zika as it arises — so stay tuned.  And for more regular updates about Zika, follow STAT’s senior writer for global health Helen Branswell on Twitter .  On people’s lips  “The fight against Zika virus is not a 100-m race, but rather a marathon in which science and public health need to work hand in hand for the benefit of our peoples.” — Carissa F. Etienne , director of Pan American Health Organization  What lies ahead  The dramatic global rise of Zika in 2016 was followed by an equally dramatic decline by the end of that year — the reasons for which epidemiologists are still sorting out. But, global health expert Dr. Peter Hotez writes , “While countries such as Brazil no longer seem to be sustaining new transmission, there are new foci popping up in additional Latin American countries, including Ecuador and Peru on the Pacific Coast of South America, as well as in Argentina and Bolivia.”  In the U.S., he says, Florida seems less at risk this year than it was last year, when the state saw more than 200 cases of local Zika transmission.  But, Hotez writes, spread of the virus in Mexico may mean that local cases in Texas crop up later this year.  The bottom line, he says? We’re in a “new normal” for Zika and other similar viruses, both in the U.S. and globally.     Friday, June 23  What’s new this week     The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it would fund a study in Guatemala to determine whether Zika virus is capable of attacking the still-developing brains of newborns. ( STAT )    Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which can carry Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, are more common across the United States than previously believed, federal experts reported. ( NBC News )    The claim that six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, had contracted Zika, was retracted. ( Houston Chronicle )    When seeking a diagnosis    Testing for Zika virus RNA in placental tissue can confirm Zika infection when the mother’s blood tests are inconclusive, according to a new study. The authors emphasize that clinicians should continue to consider testing for Zika RNA when a definitive diagnosis has not been reached. ( Medscape )    Today’s must-read    A clinic mix-up leaves pregnant woman in dark about Zika risk. ( Kaiser Health News )       Friday, June 16  What’s new this week     A group of Florida lawmakers is urging the U.S. Army to hold a hearing on its plan to give Sanofi an exclusive license to develop a Zika virus vaccine, a move that has raised concerns the product may be priced too high for many Americans, even though it was developed with taxpayer funds. ( STAT )    Six pregnant women in Harris County, in Texas, have tested positive for Zika, the first cases of the mosquito-borne disease to be reported in the area in 2017. ( Houston Chronicle )    Learning the hard way    When Zika struck last year, officials in Miami-Dade County immediately began fogging with permethrin, the active ingredient in home bug-killers such as Raid. Permethrin was sprayed at least seven times, but by the end of August, the county realized the poison had little effect and stopped using it. Officials didn’t get around to testing which pesticides kill Aedes aegypti until October — midway through Zika season.

Higher concentrations of naled in the cord blood of Chinese infants was correlated with impaired motor skills at age 9 months ( Miami Herald )   Inside STAT: Fading from view  The public’s sense of alarm over the Zika outbreak has subsided — posing a challenge to health officials who want to keep it on the radar of the people who need to pay attention. Puerto Rico declared its outbreak over this week; Brazil said its emergency was over in May. In the United States, summer approaches with little discussion of the virus outside public health circles. But the risk to pregnant women traveling abroad is still real, and not going to change anytime soon. Read more .

( WHO )  A new Discovery Channel documentary about mosquito-borne diseases, slated to air July 6, will feature Jeremy Renner as narrator ( The Hollywood Reporter )  Zika testing in May rose to levels not seen since last August, according to EHR vendor athenahealth ( Healthcare IT News )   India’s Zika silence  In the wake of India’s disclosure last month to the WHO that it had detected three cases of Zika, a number of questions have been raised about why the cases weren’t announced months ago. The Washington Post reports that health ministers said they knew about the country’s first case of Zika back in November of 2016, but they didn’t alert the public because they didn’t want “people to start panicking.” Meanwhile, The Wire points out, the country’s disease surveillance index still says zero cases of Zika have been found in the country, and the WHO has moved India up from the safest category 4 to category 2 in its ranking of Zika risk.  How microcephaly happens  A new paper sheds further light on why the Zika virus takes its most dramatic toll on the developing brain: Because a protein found in those cells helps the virus reproduce. The protein, called Musashi-1, is found in high levels in precursors to neurons — but if Zika virus is present it acts like a sponge, depriving the neurons of the protein. In fact, one family with a congenital mutation in the Musashi-1 gene has two children with microcephaly, the researchers point out, adding further evidence that this protein is key to normal brain development. That discovery may hopefully help scientists devise a way to stop the damage from occurring.  Today’s must-read   US taxpayers are funding a Zika vaccine. Let’s make sure US patients can afford it ( STAT )    Friday, May 26  What’s new this week   Sequencing the genome of Zika virus has indicated that in almost every affected country, Zika was circulating for months — or even years — before the first cases were reported ( The Atlantic )  Though good news for the broader population, a drop in Zika cases in Latin America has made it hard for research studies on the virus to recruit enough participants to have meaningful results ( Nature )  By removing protections for preexisting conditions, the GOP health bill may make insurance prohibitively expensive both for pregnant women who have had Zika and for infants born with microcephaly ( Mother Jones )   Response, in retrospect  The GAO this week released a report on the US government’s response to the Zika epidemic, concluding that the CDC and many states were underprepared to battle the outbreak. The report finds that the federal government could do better specifically on distributing and regulating diagnostic tests and on communicating geographic risk of the virus. The steps that the report concludes that the HHS should take are:   Establish a transparent process to provide CDC diagnostic tests, upon request, to manufacturers that are in the final stages of diagnostic test authorization.  Include information on CDC-developed tests distributed to or shared with public health laboratories on CDC’s website, including laboratory developed tests.  Provide details such as collection records, dates, and data limitations on posted and disseminated mosquito distribution maps to better inform mosquito control experts and the general public.  Consolidate information from individual diagnostic test labels and make this information available in a form that enables users to more readily compare information across tests.  Require manufacturers to list the identity of comparator assays on their diagnostic test labels.   A startling case study  A recently published case study describes an American adolescent who contracted Zika on a trip to the Caribbean. Symptoms of sore throat, headache, rash, and joint pain resolved soon after the individual returned to the US, but a range of worrying psychiatric symptoms — including “excessive energy, decreased sleep, rapid and tangential speech, grandiose thinking, impulsivity, and decreased inhibition” — stuck around for weeks afterward and even necessitated a period of hospitalization. Fifteen weeks after symptom onset, doctors reported, the patient’s symptoms were better but not gone. All told, they write, the case “raise[s] the possibility that Zika virus infection may trigger neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.”  Today’s must-read   ‘I taught them to love Valentina as I do’: Mother’s faith guides struggle to care for daughter with microcephaly ( Milwaukee Journal Sentinel )    Friday, May 19  What’s new this week   Cuba had one of the most successful Zika-reduction campaigns in Latin America last year — but even so, the virus is taking a toll there. Health officials said this week that 1,847 residents have so far contracted the virus, the first such information out of the country in months. It’s unclear how many of those cases were locally transmitted ( Reuters )  Sanofi Pasteur has rejected a request from the US Army to set an affordable US price for a Zika vaccine that the company is developing with American taxpayer funds, prompting an angry response from Senator Bernie Sanders ( STAT )   Fighting cancer with Zika?  Studying Zika’s tragic effects on fetuses has revealed two key qualities of the virus: It can cross the blood-brain barrier, and it specifically targets the developing brain. Now scientists are wondering whether those qualities might make the virus a cancer-killer . A newly funded research project in the UK will examine, in cells and in mice, whether Zika virus can selectively attack and kill brain cancer cells.  A key challenge of delivering drugs to the brain is the blood-brain barrier, which prohibits many molecules from passing into the brain — but Zika appears to be able to pass. What’s more, glioblastoma cells — a highly lethal form of brain cancer — resemble fetal brain cells in a number of ways. Combining those two lines of reasoning, scientists are now embarking on a project to see how Zika interacts with the cancer.   Friday, May 12  What’s new this week   Brazil today declared an end to national emergency status for Zika virus. The number of cases in the country dropped 95 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period a year ago, officials said ( BBC )  In an effort to kill mosquito larvae near homes, residents of one Florida county can get free “mosquito fish” at their local library ( ABC )  The costs, just in the near term, of Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean could be $18 billion, according to a new study. That amount covers just 2015-2017 and it is the upper bound of a wide range of possibilities, depending on rates of transmission ( press release )   Testing advice changes for pregnant women  The CDC is now suggesting that women thinking of getting pregnant, and who may be exposed to the Zika virus, should consider having their blood tested for Zika antibodies before they get pregnant . That’s because IgM, a type of antibody triggered by Zika infection, can stick around in the blood for months, and doctors can’t always tell if the infection happened before pregnancy — which poses no risk to the fetus — or during pregnancy, when it’s a high risk. To distinguish those two scenarios, women at risk of exposure should ideally be tested before pregnancy and again each trimester.   Friday, May 5  What’s new this week   The Prevention and Public Health Fund, which would be eliminated under the health bill that passed the House this week, provides a significant chunk of the CDC’s budget — including funding efforts to fight Zika ( STAT , NASHP )  Miami-Dade County has spent about $25 million on battling Zika so far, officials say ( Miami Herald )   Rift between Puerto Rico and CDC  Of all the states and territories, US health officials last year were especially worried about Zika’s potential impacts in Puerto Rico — which was part of their motivation to create the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System to track pregnant women and identify infants and fetuses with Zika-related birth defects. The CDC awarded Puerto Rico’s Department of Health $9.5 million for the project. But since then the agencies have had a protracted feud, a document obtained by STAT shows, with the CDC claiming that health officials disregarded the established case definition for identifying affected infants — creating the illusion of far fewer affected infants than there may in fact be.

And more than 3,300 pregnant women there are known to have contracted the virus. But the number of babies born in Puerto Rico with microcephaly and other birth defects caused by Zika is unexpectedly low — just 16 cases — which is leading experts to question whether the island territory is downplaying its Zika spread, possibly to protect its tourism industry.   2 more babies have been born in the US with #Zika -induced birth defects. So far 65 pregnancies have been affected.

Researchers found that mice with West Nile or dengue antibodies were much more likely to die from subsequent Zika infection ( Science News )   Brazil’s Zika mystery  After so many Brazilian babies were born with microcephaly in 2015, the country braced itself for a similar tsunami in 2016. But it didn’t materialize — and researchers have been trying to figure out why. A new paper offers a theory : The authors suggest the region’s first wave of Zika may have been its only wave of Zika to date. Illnesses in 2016, by that reckoning, were caused by a different virus producing lookalike symptoms to Zika — likely the chikungunya virus — but not causing microcephaly. In some ways, that’s good news; it might suggest Zika outbreaks are swift. But it doesn’t mean the virus is done. More likely, said senior author Christopher Dye, is that Zika will return after births create pools of people who have no immunity to the virus, hitting perhaps when people aren’t expecting it.

But in addition to that, there’s a more specific provision that would threaten Zika funding directly, points out Ed Yong at the Atlantic : A halving of the budget for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) program. That program helps state public health laboratories train their staff and buy equipment; these labs are in many cases the ones running blood tests for Zika. When, for instance, Congress failed for months to fund a Zika response last year, Minnesota’s public health laboratory used ELC funds to begin its public testing. With half as much funding, researchers say, being prepared for the next public health threat will be much harder.

The Washington Post reports:  There were two types of solution the District could have purchased to conduct a phase of the test. One bottle came marked with a “D,” for diluted, and the other with a “U”, for undiluted. D.C. lab workers had purchased the diluted version, Tran said, and then mistakenly watered it down as if it was the more concentrated one, weakening the ability to detect for Zika.  That mistake, missed for more than six months, is a worrisome failing — enough so that officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have now audited the lab, the Post reports , to determine how the mistakes were made and whether they’ve been fully rectified.

In one case, a pregnant Las Vegas-area woman has tested positive for Zika, the county’s first non-travel related case. Health officials say she caught the virus via sex; her partner previously tested positive. But, according to local television station KLAS , he was never informed of his test results, in what’s being blamed on a “computer glitch.” It’s not yet clear whether the woman’s fetus has been infected with the virus.  And on the other side of the country, scientists at Washington, D.C.’s public health lab botched Zika tests for more than 400 people from July to December 2016. The “mathematical error” meant that people were getting negative test results when they could have actually been infected.

That policy prevents foreign nonprofit groups that receive federal funds from administering abortions or providing abortion counseling or referrals. That could mean a hit to the budget of some nonprofits dealing with Zika, if they continue counseling patients about abortions.

As citizens we have to protect our families and communities. Thinking about it there is one Android app that can help us to take action against the threats around. It is called FuraAedes. It notifies about the registered threats and don’t let us forget to take action when it is needed.
