You would get nice looking factorial.  13 choose 7 over 52 choose 7 <=> (13!/7!)/(52!/7!)  I hope this helps     3/28/2015 |  Mitiku D.           Comment                 Bill P. | A math tutor that is both knowledgeable and patient in secondary math. A math tutor that is both knowledgeable ...                0            The probability that the first card is a heart is 13/52  For the second card it is 12/51 (There are only 51 cards and only 12 of them are in the heart suit.)  For the third card it is 11/50  4th card 10/49  5th card 9/48  6th card 8/47  7th card 7/46    The total probability of all of these events occurring is the product of each individual probability.    So, the answer is (13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48 * 47 * 46)    which equals exactly 33 / 2,572,780 or roughly 1 chance in about 77,963     3/28/2015 | Bill P.

So, you want to know what the odds are of being dealt 6 hearts in a row from the top of the deck.  That number will be the product of the individual probabilities.    There are 13 hearts in a deck of 52 cards. As each heart is drawn, both the number of hearts and the number of cards will be reduced.    So, the probability will be (13/52)(12/51)(11/50)(10/49)(9/48)(8/47) = 8.2x10 -5 or 1 in 11,863    The first time I answered your question, I misinterpreted what was meant. However, the above answer is correct.     3/31/2015 |  Joseph C.           Comment                Create a Free Account to Continue  Already have an account?

(1/4)(12/51)(11/50)(10/49) = 0.264%     12/2/2014 |  Philip P.           Comment                Create a Free Account to Continue  Already have an account?

You should draw a tree diagram, where each selection has three branches: hearts, red but not hearts (i.e., diamonds), and black (clubs or spades). You don't need to label all 3 3 branches, just  hearts-black-hearts and diamonds-black-hearts.  For hearts-black-hearts you have (13/52)(26/51)(12/50).  For diamonds-black-hearts you have (13/52)(26/51)(13/50).  Add those two branches up to get the probability:  (13/52)(26/51)[12/50 + 13/50]=(13/52)(26/51)(25/50)â‰ˆ0.0637.     1/16/2014 | Andre W.

P1=Probability 1st card is red = 0.5   (fairly obvious)  P2=Probability 2nd card is black = 26/51   (recall there is no replacement and ONE red card is gone)  P3=Probability 3rd card is a heart: This one is tricky because we may or may not have drawn a heart on P1    Let's examine the sample space for P3.  If things have gone well thus far, we'll have    25 red cards (12 hearts, 13 diamonds) OR (13 hearts, 12 diamonds)  25 black cards    The probability of drawing a heart is either 12/50 or 13/50 depending on what happened in P1.  Since the probability is equally likeiy, we can average the two:    P3=12.5/50    Therefore: Total probability=P1*P2*P3= (0.5)(26/51)(12.5/50)=0.0637255 ~6.37%     1/16/2014 | Tom D.

Comment            Comments    So there are two answers? Is there a way to have only one answer?           1/16/2014 |  Jack from Liberty, MO      You can take ~6.37% to the bank.  Andre W and I have slightly different ways of computing it, but the results are identical (to infinite number of places since 13/52=12.5/50.  Both methods are correct.           1/16/2014 |  Tom D.      Hi Jack;  I do not know what Tom is taking to the bank. I suspect it is not legal tender.  While it is true that 13/52 does equal 12.5/50.  This is a non-issue herein.  The fact is that the first card drawn was red whereas there are two possibilities as to what red is:hearts and diamonds.  The last card drawn was a red heart.  There are two results.  I cannot resolve that.           1/16/2014 |  Vivian L.      Hi Vivian,    Sorry, I didn't mean to offend.  There are often many ways to solve a probability problem.  Some paths seem quite different, but the result is the same.  Andrew & I chose two different paths:    1)He chose to compute separate paths for diamond/heart on 1st card  2)I chose to compute arbitrary red on 1st card.  This forces an average of probabilities on the 3rd card.  Nevertheless, the math is the same.    Your answer is fine, but doesn't concatenate to a final probability.  If you had done so, you would also have gotten the same result.  I was merely addressing Jacks 'dilemma' of two answers at the time he commented.    Cheers!           1/16/2014 |  Tom D.      Note that Tom's method requires a weighted average. In this case, the weighting wasn't apparent, because "red" and "not red" on the first selection carry the same weight (0.5). If, for example, the problem is modified to "the first card is an ace", the weighting would be 1/4 (ace of hearts) and 3/4 (ace of non-hearts), so that P=(1/13)(26/51)(1*12/50 + 3*13/50). My tree path method would again give the same answer written differently: P=(1/52)(26/51)(12/50)+(3/52)(26/51)(13/50).           1/16/2014 |  Andre W.

Quan P. | Middle school, High school, College Math courses Middle school, High school, College Math...                1            You can answer this question by the following steps:  1. Understanding the all possible outputs:  2. Calculate the probability for each output and then find the total probability.    P(all hearts) = P(1st card is heart) * P(2nd card is heart) * P(3rd card is heart) * P(4th card is heart) * P(5th card is heart)  = (13/52)*(12/51)*(11/50)*(10/49)*(9/48)    The processes to find P(all clubs), P(all spades), P(all diamonds) are similar to find P(all hearts)  But, notice that the number of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds are equal to each other, 13 cards.  Therefore, you just multiply the P(all hearts) by 4, you will get the P(5 cards are same suit).    Hope it helps.  Quan.     10/14/2013 | Quan P.

Disregarding the order in which they are drawn, the possible outcomes are $\binom{52}{3}$. Out of these, how many include all cards of the same suit (say hearts)? There are $\binom{13}{3}$ ways in which you can get all 13 heart cards.  Since there are 4 suits, there are $4\binom{13}{3}$ ways in which all cards drawn are of the same suit. Thus the probability is:  $$\frac{4\binom{13}{3}}{\binom{52}{3}}\approx 5.18\%$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 4 '17 at 16:30       PatrickT   150 2 11        answered Oct 18 '14 at 16:44       Jorge Fernández   72k 10 83 176                  Please forgive me to ask this but what is this called (52 3) , obviously not division operation? – f855a864  Oct 18 '14 at 16:53        2      It is what is called a binomial coefficient In some schools they write is as $12C3$ instead of $\binom{12}{3}$ In the calculator it is the button that has a symbol $nCm$. $\binom{12}{3}$ is the number of subsets of three elements a set of $12$ elements has.

Odds of being dealt any pair?         up vote  6  down vote  favorite  1      This is not to aid a gambling habit.  I am simply curious how to do this math. You get dealt 3 cards.  What are the odds of having any pair?  (We can exclude 3 of a kind)  Total number of hands = $\begin{pmatrix}52 \\ 3\end{pmatrix}$  = 22100  What do I do next?  (Added from response below)  How many ways can I get a pair of 2's, for example?
$\begin{pmatrix}4 \\ 2\end{pmatrix}$  = 6
And there are 13 types of pairs I can get.
So, 13x6 = 72.
So, there is only a 72/22100 chance of being dealt a pair?

Now for the hand, the order doesn't matter, so there are $$\frac{52\cdot 48\cdot 44}{6} = 18304$$ hands without a pair. Now the number of hands with a pair is $$\binom{52}{3} - 18304 = 3796.$$
Thus, the probability of getting a hand with a pair is $$\frac{3796}{22100} \approx 17.2\%.$$  EDIT:
The above solution counts three of a kind as a hand with a pair. In the case that $3$ of a kind are forbidden, we have to subtract the $$\frac{52\cdot 3\cdot 2}{6} = 52$$ hands with $3$ of a kind. Now there are $$3796 - 52 = 3744$$ "good" hands, so the probability of getting a pair, but not three of a kind, is $$\frac{3744}{22100} \approx 16.9\%.$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 3 '15 at 13:34             answered Mar 3 '13 at 17:50       azimut   15.5k 10 46 93                  Depends on whether being dealt three of a kind counts as also being dealt a pair.

The chances of getting a pair are simply 1 - (the chances of getting no pair).  The first card is some card with probability 1.  There are now 3 cards in the deck, which if dealt to you, would give you a pair, so the chances of not getting a pair on the second card are 48/51.  Now there are 6 cards in the deck which will give you a pair if you receive them, so the chances of not getting a pair on the third card is 44/50.  Overall chances of getting no pair is 1*(48/51)*(44/50), so the chances of getting a pair is 1 minus that product.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 3 '13 at 17:50       Keith Backman   165 5              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Here's another way, there are 2 ways to get a pair from 3 drawn cards:   1) Second card drawn matches first, third does not match first or second.  $$\frac{3}{51} \cdot \frac{48}{50} = \frac{144}{2550}$$  2) Second card drawn doesn't match first, third matches first or second.  $$\frac{48}{51} \cdot \frac{6}{50} = \frac{288}{2550}$$   Add the two probabilities to get:  $$
\frac{144 + 288}{2550} = \frac{432}{2550} \text{ or } 16.94\%

The probability that each person does not have a pair is $(1-p_{pair})$, and for $n$ people not to have a pair it would be $(1-p_{pair})^n$.

Let's look at a pair of aces.  There are three ways it can happen AAX AXA XAA where X is any card except an ace, so the probability of getting a pair of aces is the sum of these three possibilities.  $$\frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{3}{51} \cdot \frac{48}{50} + \frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{48}{51} \cdot \frac{3}{50} + \frac{48}{52} \cdot \frac{4}{51} \cdot \frac{3}{50} \approx 0.013$$  Now we just multiply by 13 (there are 13 possible pairs) and 100 to get the percentage.  $0.013 \cdot 13 \cdot 100=16.9 \%$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 22 '17 at 4:40       Eden   1 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Answered Dec 9, 2016 · Author has 489 answers and 580k answer views A standard deck of playing cards has four suits — each suit has 3 face cards. That means a standard deck already contains twelve face cards, so the probability of getting three is 100%. Or did you mean “What is the chance of getting 3 face cards by picking only three cards without replacement?” If that’s the case, then you calculate 12/52 * 11/51 * 10/50 to get your answer. 3k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below You draw 10 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards.

From a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing 3 kings? Ask New Question   Dinesh Reddy Answered Feb 25, 2018 The deck of 52 playing cards is broadly classified into 2 which are further divided into 2 divisions. Red(26 cards) and Black(26 cards). The red cards are further divided into diamonds♦️ (13 cards) and hearts♥️ (13 cards). The black cards are further divided into clubs♣️(13 cards) and spades♠️(13 cards). In each division of 13 cards classified above, there are/is- 3 face cards- King, Queen, Jack One ace card 9 number cards(numbered from 2–10) So, there are twelve face cards in a deck. When three cards are picked, you may pick any three face cards out of the 12 face cards. P(getting 3 face cards)= No. of favourable face cards/ Total cards I.e, 12C3/52C3.

Undo   Kurusar Iyer , works at Freelancing Answered Feb 9, 2018 · Author has 109 answers and 151.6k answer views A standard deck of cards has 52 cards. It has 4 different suits - Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. Each of these suits has 3 Face cards- Jack, Queen and King. Therefore, in all there are 4 * 3 = 12 face cards. Probability of getting 1st face card = 12/52 Probability of getting 2nd face card = 11/51 Probability of getting 3rd face card = 10/50 Hence, probability of getting 3 face cards = (12/52) * (11/51) * (10/50) = 11/1105 or 0.9954% Hope this makes things clear. 592 Views · View Upvoters   David Kenneth Richardson Answered Dec 9, 2016 · Author has 448 answers and 223.1k answer views There are four suites in a deck of cards and 3 face cards per suite.

Williams , B.A. Mathematics and English Lit., M.D. Answered Dec 15, 2017 · Author has 72 answers and 56.1k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of picking 3 cards out of a standard deck and them being all face cards? There are 3 face cards in each suit (Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits in all, so there are 12 face cards in a deck of 52. The first card drawn you have 12/52 chance. If you draw a face card then the next draw there will be one less available in the remaining cards so the odds are 11/51. Then you must draw a third card from a deck with 10 remaining face cards out of 50 cards so the odds are 10/50. All three of these events must happen so the total odds are (12/52) * ( 11/51) * (10/50) = 0.00995 which is very close to 1/100. 892 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions Given a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of each event getting a king of diamonds?

Answered Feb 8, 2018 · Author has 1.8k answers and 358.8k answer views There is only 1 way to pick 1 suit to get 2 cards from and 3 suits to get 1 card from, because it is specified that the suit you get 2 cards from is clubs, so we don’t have to worry about suit selection. From the 13 possible clubs, there are [math]\binom{13}{2}[/math] ways of picking 2 cards. From the 13 possible spades, there are 13 ways of picking the single card. From the 13 possible hearts, there are 13 ways of picking the single card. From the 13 diamonds, there are 13 ways of picking the single card. Multiply those numbers, and we have the number of hands that meet the conditions of this problem. [math]\dbinom{13}{2} \cdot 13^3 = 171366[/math] Then you divide that by how many ways there are to chose 5 cards from the whole deck of 52. The number of ways of choosing 5 cards from a deck of 52 are: [math]\dbinom{52}{5} = 2598960[/math] That makes the probability: [math]\dfrac{171366}{2598960} = \dfrac{2197}{33320}[/math] 96 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions A player is dealt 5 cards.

Undo Answer Wiki 1 Answer   Danielle Kain , CS109 TA at Stanford University Answered Mar 6, 2017 · Author has 88 answers and 144.5k answer views Let’s suppose for the sake of this question that we are playing with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. We’ll define event A as the probability that we draw at least one king; event B as the probability of drawing no kings. [math]P(A) = 1 - P(B)[/math] This holds because the only way not to draw at least one king, is to draw zero kings. Thus [math]P(A) + P(B) = 1[/math] . On the first draw, we must avoid 4 (kings) out of the total 52 cards; the second we must avoid 4 of the remaining 51; and on the last draw we must avoid 4 of the remaining 50: [math]P(B) = \dfrac{52–4}{52} * \dfrac{51–4}{51} * \dfrac{50–4}{50} [/math] [math]P(B) = \dfrac{4324}{5525}[/math] [math]P(A) = 1 - P(B) = \dfrac{1201}{5525}[/math] [math]P(A) =[/math] ~ [math].22[/math] or [math]22%[/math] Another way to solve this problem would be to enumerate all the different ways we could draw 1, 2, 3, or 4 kings. 1.3k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions Three cards are pulled from a deck of 52 cards.

Sometimes you can rephrase the combinations to an equivalent number that is easier to calculate, but I don't see a way to do that in this case. As a result you will just have to sum up the result for each independent partition. There are 12 face cards, 4 threes, and 36 other cards. Here is the total combinations for the partition [math][2,1,4][/math] for precisely 2 face cards, 1 three, and 4 other cards  [math]\binom{12}{2}\binom{4}{1}\binom{36}{4} =66\cdot4\cdot58905=15,550,920[/math] You need to add that to the combos for the other partitions: [3,1,3],[4,1,2],[5,1,1],[6,1,0],[2,2,3],[3,2,2],[4,2,1],[5,2,0],[2,3,2],[3,3,1],[4,3,0],[2,4,1],[3,4,0].

So these are all of our “ possible events ”; One club can be drawn from a pile of 13 clubs in [math]13C1[/math] ways (13) and the remaining two -which are not clubs- are drawn from the pile of the remaining 39 “non clubs” in [math]39C2 [/math] ways (741), so we multiply both and we have that one club can be drawn in 9,633 ways. Two clubs can be drawn from a pile of 13 clubs in [math]13C2[/math] ways (78) and the remaining -which is not a club- in [math]39C1 [/math] ways (39), so we multiply both and have that two clubs can be drawn in 3,042 ways. Three clubs can be drawn from a pile of 13 clubs in [math]13C3[/math] ways: 286 ways. The ways of getting one club or two clubs or three clubs (add the results) is 12,961 . And these are our “favorable events ”. Then, dividing favorable by possible: [math]12961/22100[/math] is 0.586. *A faster way, as other answers suggest, is to get how many ways is there to get zero clubs and then subtract from 1. I think it is definitely best to know both ways :) 16k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Lissette Deza promoted  by Udacity.com Develop new tech skills. Be in demand.

Thread starter  domino     Start date  Sep 15, 2008                      D      domino  New Member  Sep 15, 2008   #1        Sep 15, 2008   #1       I'm trying to figure out an algorithm to calculate the odds of being dealt 3 of a particular suit in a multi deck situation.  Assume we have 3 decks [156 cards] with 39 of each suit.  A player gets dealt 3 random cards.  How do I calculate the odds of all three of these being the same suit?  What if 30 cards are missing, but we know what suits the 30 cards [ex: 10 clubs, 4 hearts 9 spades 7 diamonds] are?  How would you adjust said algorithm to compensate?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.                        N      Navaak  New Member  Sep 15, 2008   #2        Sep 15, 2008   #2       Ok, here goes... sorry for the annotation, if it is kind of vague.  Assume you want to take k items out of n items, without caring about the order. Then the possible ways to do this are, according to probability theory, n!/(k!*(n-k)!).  So, let us assume you need to be dealt specifically 3 spades out of 156 cards. Since there are 39 spades in total, there are 39!/(3!*36!)=9139 ways to do this. Note that I used the number of spades, not total number of cards, as n . Now, the sample space (the possible ways to pull any 3 cards from a pool of 156 cards) is 156!/(3!*153!)=620620. Therefore, the probability to be dealt 3 spades is: P("3 spades")= 9139/620620 = 0.014725597, which is, by the way, quite low.  However, we do not specifically need spades, but any 3 cards that are the same suit. Since the possibilities of being dealt 3 spades, or 3 diamonds, or 3 clubs, or 3 hearts are all independent, we can simply add them:  P("3 of same suit")=P("3 spades")+P("3 diamonds")+P("3 clubs")+P("hearts")=4*P("3 spades")=0.058902388, because all suits have the same probability to be dealt.  Now, for the second part, things get a little more interesting, but still easy to calculate. Instead of using 39!/(3!*36!) and 156!/(3!*153!), use the numbers you define. In your example, where 30 cards are missing, of which 9 are spades, the probability to be dealt 3 spades is: (30!/(3!*27!))/(126!/(3!*123!)). Note that both the total nmber of spades and the total number of cards has to be modified.  You can calculate the probabilities for the rest of the suits in the same way. I hope this helps                        D      domino  New Member  Sep 15, 2008   #3        Sep 15, 2008   #3       thanks navaak, this is exactly what i was looking for.

For example, the probability of choosing one card, and getting a certain number card (e.g. a 7) or one from a certain suit (e.g. a club).  You might wonder why you’re learning about cards (what’s the point?). The answer is that finding probabilities (like the probability of contracting an illness) can be a tricky concept to grasp at first. So your instructor will try and simplify problems using cards, dice or Bingo numbers. Once you’ve grasped the basics, you’ll start to use “real life” data for probability (usually a bit later on in the class, for example in normal distributions ). Here’s how to find the probability of picking something in a couple of simple steps.  Probability of picking from a deck of cards: Steps    Step 1:  figure out the total number of cards you might pull. Write down all the possible cards and mark the ones that you would pull out (in our case we’ve been asked the probability of a club or a seven so we’re going to mark all the clubs and all the sevens):  hearts: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10, j, q, k, A  clubs: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, j, q, k, A  spades: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10, j, q, k, A  diamonds: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10, j, q, k, A  This totals 16 cards. * Step 2:  Count the total number of cards in the deck(s) . We have one deck, so the total = 52 Step 3:  Write the answer as a fraction .  Divide step 3 by Step 4:  16 / 52 That’s it! Tip : It isn’t as easy as just adding the number of sevens (4) and the number of clubs (13). If you did this for this example, you’d get 17 cards, not the correct answer of 16. The reason for this is that one of the cards in our example is both a club AND a number 7. Probability of picking from a deck of cards: Using Excel Watch the video or read below:  It gets a LOT more complex if you’re playing a card game, you have a certain number of cards in your hand, and you want to know your odds of getting a certain card if you are drawing a certain number of cards. You have to use something called a hypergeometric distribution to figure out the odds. The formula is: H (n) = C (X, n) * C (Y – X, Z – n) / C (Y, Z) Where: X is the number of a certain card in the deck Y is the total number of cards in the deck Z is the number of cards drawn N is the number you are checking for As you can see, the formula uses combinations and factorials — it can get a bit messy to do this by hand, so consider using technology like Excel. The command in Excel is: “=HYPGEOMDIST(N,Z,X,Y)”. For example, if you have a standard 52 card deck and draw 4 cards, what will be your chances of not drawing an ace? X is 4 Y is 52 Z is 4 N is 0 (as you want zero aces!) the formula would be: =HYPGEOMDIST(0,4,4,52) you will get the chance for not drawing the card. Like the explanation?

I take a deck and start turning over cards, one at a time.  Calling out the number..so the first card is an ace, second is 2 etc. jack is 11, queen 12, king 13 then back to ace.  I can’t get through whole deck without hitting the same card as the number.  I.e. The fifth card is a 5. Or the 11th card is a jack.  What are the odds/chances of getting through the deck without hitting the same card?  I tried many times, but never made it.          Andale November 9, 2016 at 10:02 am    The odds are practically nil You have a 4/52 = 1/13 chance of losing on the first draw (an ace comes up). On the second draw, you have a 1/13 chance of turning a two (assuming you didn’t pick a 2 in round 1). If you did pick a 2 the odds still aren’t good (3/52). When you go down the list like this, you should be able to see there’s practically a zil chance of making it to the end. If you want to get an algorithm, it might be easier to start with 12 cards to see the pattern more clearly (I don’t know of an algorithm for this!)          B. Seitsang February 22, 2017 at 12:30 pm    Find the probability that five cards chosen at random from a deck of 52 will contain: a) no aces b) atleast one ace c) exactly 1 ace          Andale February 22, 2017 at 6:11 pm    Where do you get stuck?          Tom April 5, 2017 at 7:38 pm    Pick four cards from a regular deck without replacement. What is the probability that you get exactly two hearts at the first and fourth cards???????????????????          Andale April 6, 2017 at 6:02 am    Probability of that first heart is 1/13. As you don’t replace, probability of a heart on pick two is 12/51. The probability of getting a heart on round three is 12/50. The probability of getting a heart on round four is 12/49. So, total probability = 1/13 * 12/49          Sierra Show October 1, 2017 at 7:59 am    In the example, where X=4, Y= 52, Z=4,& N=0, I understand everything except why does X=4?          Andale October 1, 2017 at 8:14 am    X is the number of a certain card in the deck So, there are 4 aces.         Find an article   Search       Feel like "cheating" at Statistics?

You would get nice looking factorial.  13 choose 7 over 52 choose 7 <=> (13!/7!)/(52!/7!)  I hope this helps     3/28/2015 |  Mitiku D.           Comment                 Bill P. | A math tutor that is both knowledgeable and patient in secondary math. A math tutor that is both knowledgeable ...                0            The probability that the first card is a heart is 13/52  For the second card it is 12/51 (There are only 51 cards and only 12 of them are in the heart suit.)  For the third card it is 11/50  4th card 10/49  5th card 9/48  6th card 8/47  7th card 7/46    The total probability of all of these events occurring is the product of each individual probability.    So, the answer is (13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48 * 47 * 46)    which equals exactly 33 / 2,572,780 or roughly 1 chance in about 77,963     3/28/2015 | Bill P.

So, you want to know what the odds are of being dealt 6 hearts in a row from the top of the deck.  That number will be the product of the individual probabilities.    There are 13 hearts in a deck of 52 cards. As each heart is drawn, both the number of hearts and the number of cards will be reduced.    So, the probability will be (13/52)(12/51)(11/50)(10/49)(9/48)(8/47) = 8.2x10 -5 or 1 in 11,863    The first time I answered your question, I misinterpreted what was meant. However, the above answer is correct.     3/31/2015 |  Joseph C.           Comment                Create a Free Account to Continue  Already have an account?

(1/4)(12/51)(11/50)(10/49) = 0.264%     12/2/2014 |  Philip P.           Comment                Create a Free Account to Continue  Already have an account?

You should draw a tree diagram, where each selection has three branches: hearts, red but not hearts (i.e., diamonds), and black (clubs or spades). You don't need to label all 3 3 branches, just  hearts-black-hearts and diamonds-black-hearts.  For hearts-black-hearts you have (13/52)(26/51)(12/50).  For diamonds-black-hearts you have (13/52)(26/51)(13/50).  Add those two branches up to get the probability:  (13/52)(26/51)[12/50 + 13/50]=(13/52)(26/51)(25/50)â‰ˆ0.0637.     1/16/2014 | Andre W.

P1=Probability 1st card is red = 0.5   (fairly obvious)  P2=Probability 2nd card is black = 26/51   (recall there is no replacement and ONE red card is gone)  P3=Probability 3rd card is a heart: This one is tricky because we may or may not have drawn a heart on P1    Let's examine the sample space for P3.  If things have gone well thus far, we'll have    25 red cards (12 hearts, 13 diamonds) OR (13 hearts, 12 diamonds)  25 black cards    The probability of drawing a heart is either 12/50 or 13/50 depending on what happened in P1.  Since the probability is equally likeiy, we can average the two:    P3=12.5/50    Therefore: Total probability=P1*P2*P3= (0.5)(26/51)(12.5/50)=0.0637255 ~6.37%     1/16/2014 | Tom D.

Comment            Comments    So there are two answers? Is there a way to have only one answer?           1/16/2014 |  Jack from Liberty, MO      You can take ~6.37% to the bank.  Andre W and I have slightly different ways of computing it, but the results are identical (to infinite number of places since 13/52=12.5/50.  Both methods are correct.           1/16/2014 |  Tom D.      Hi Jack;  I do not know what Tom is taking to the bank. I suspect it is not legal tender.  While it is true that 13/52 does equal 12.5/50.  This is a non-issue herein.  The fact is that the first card drawn was red whereas there are two possibilities as to what red is:hearts and diamonds.  The last card drawn was a red heart.  There are two results.  I cannot resolve that.           1/16/2014 |  Vivian L.      Hi Vivian,    Sorry, I didn't mean to offend.  There are often many ways to solve a probability problem.  Some paths seem quite different, but the result is the same.  Andrew & I chose two different paths:    1)He chose to compute separate paths for diamond/heart on 1st card  2)I chose to compute arbitrary red on 1st card.  This forces an average of probabilities on the 3rd card.  Nevertheless, the math is the same.    Your answer is fine, but doesn't concatenate to a final probability.  If you had done so, you would also have gotten the same result.  I was merely addressing Jacks 'dilemma' of two answers at the time he commented.    Cheers!           1/16/2014 |  Tom D.      Note that Tom's method requires a weighted average. In this case, the weighting wasn't apparent, because "red" and "not red" on the first selection carry the same weight (0.5). If, for example, the problem is modified to "the first card is an ace", the weighting would be 1/4 (ace of hearts) and 3/4 (ace of non-hearts), so that P=(1/13)(26/51)(1*12/50 + 3*13/50). My tree path method would again give the same answer written differently: P=(1/52)(26/51)(12/50)+(3/52)(26/51)(13/50).           1/16/2014 |  Andre W.

What is the probability that all are of the same suit (all hearts, all clubs, all spades, or all diamonds)?

Quan P. | Middle school, High school, College Math courses Middle school, High school, College Math...                1            You can answer this question by the following steps:  1. Understanding the all possible outputs:  2. Calculate the probability for each output and then find the total probability.    P(all hearts) = P(1st card is heart) * P(2nd card is heart) * P(3rd card is heart) * P(4th card is heart) * P(5th card is heart)  = (13/52)*(12/51)*(11/50)*(10/49)*(9/48)    The processes to find P(all clubs), P(all spades), P(all diamonds) are similar to find P(all hearts)  But, notice that the number of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds are equal to each other, 13 cards.  Therefore, you just multiply the P(all hearts) by 4, you will get the P(5 cards are same suit).    Hope it helps.  Quan.     10/14/2013 | Quan P.

Disregarding the order in which they are drawn, the possible outcomes are $\binom{52}{3}$. Out of these, how many include all cards of the same suit (say hearts)? There are $\binom{13}{3}$ ways in which you can get all 13 heart cards.  Since there are 4 suits, there are $4\binom{13}{3}$ ways in which all cards drawn are of the same suit. Thus the probability is:  $$\frac{4\binom{13}{3}}{\binom{52}{3}}\approx 5.18\%$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 4 '17 at 16:30       PatrickT   150 2 11        answered Oct 18 '14 at 16:44       Jorge Fernández   72k 10 83 176                  Please forgive me to ask this but what is this called (52 3) , obviously not division operation? – f855a864  Oct 18 '14 at 16:53        2      It is what is called a binomial coefficient In some schools they write is as $12C3$ instead of $\binom{12}{3}$ In the calculator it is the button that has a symbol $nCm$. $\binom{12}{3}$ is the number of subsets of three elements a set of $12$ elements has.

Odds of being dealt any pair?         up vote  6  down vote  favorite  1      This is not to aid a gambling habit.  I am simply curious how to do this math. You get dealt 3 cards.  What are the odds of having any pair?  (We can exclude 3 of a kind)  Total number of hands = $\begin{pmatrix}52 \\ 3\end{pmatrix}$  = 22100  What do I do next?  (Added from response below)  How many ways can I get a pair of 2's, for example?
$\begin{pmatrix}4 \\ 2\end{pmatrix}$  = 6
And there are 13 types of pairs I can get.
So, 13x6 = 72.
So, there is only a 72/22100 chance of being dealt a pair?

Now for the hand, the order doesn't matter, so there are $$\frac{52\cdot 48\cdot 44}{6} = 18304$$ hands without a pair. Now the number of hands with a pair is $$\binom{52}{3} - 18304 = 3796.$$
Thus, the probability of getting a hand with a pair is $$\frac{3796}{22100} \approx 17.2\%.$$  EDIT:
The above solution counts three of a kind as a hand with a pair. In the case that $3$ of a kind are forbidden, we have to subtract the $$\frac{52\cdot 3\cdot 2}{6} = 52$$ hands with $3$ of a kind. Now there are $$3796 - 52 = 3744$$ "good" hands, so the probability of getting a pair, but not three of a kind, is $$\frac{3744}{22100} \approx 16.9\%.$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 3 '15 at 13:34             answered Mar 3 '13 at 17:50       azimut   15.5k 10 46 93                  Depends on whether being dealt three of a kind counts as also being dealt a pair.

The chances of getting a pair are simply 1 - (the chances of getting no pair).  The first card is some card with probability 1.  There are now 3 cards in the deck, which if dealt to you, would give you a pair, so the chances of not getting a pair on the second card are 48/51.  Now there are 6 cards in the deck which will give you a pair if you receive them, so the chances of not getting a pair on the third card is 44/50.  Overall chances of getting no pair is 1*(48/51)*(44/50), so the chances of getting a pair is 1 minus that product.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 3 '13 at 17:50       Keith Backman   165 5              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Here's another way, there are 2 ways to get a pair from 3 drawn cards:   1) Second card drawn matches first, third does not match first or second.  $$\frac{3}{51} \cdot \frac{48}{50} = \frac{144}{2550}$$  2) Second card drawn doesn't match first, third matches first or second.  $$\frac{48}{51} \cdot \frac{6}{50} = \frac{288}{2550}$$   Add the two probabilities to get:  $$
\frac{144 + 288}{2550} = \frac{432}{2550} \text{ or } 16.94\%

The probability that each person does not have a pair is $(1-p_{pair})$, and for $n$ people not to have a pair it would be $(1-p_{pair})^n$.

Ask New Question   Dinesh Reddy Answered Feb 25, 2018 The deck of 52 playing cards is broadly classified into 2 which are further divided into 2 divisions. Red(26 cards) and Black(26 cards). The red cards are further divided into diamonds♦️ (13 cards) and hearts♥️ (13 cards). The black cards are further divided into clubs♣️(13 cards) and spades♠️(13 cards). In each division of 13 cards classified above, there are/is- 3 face cards- King, Queen, Jack One ace card 9 number cards(numbered from 2–10) So, there are twelve face cards in a deck. When three cards are picked, you may pick any three face cards out of the 12 face cards. P(getting 3 face cards)= No. of favourable face cards/ Total cards I.e, 12C3/52C3.

Undo   Kurusar Iyer , works at Freelancing Answered Feb 9, 2018 · Author has 109 answers and 151.6k answer views A standard deck of cards has 52 cards. It has 4 different suits - Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. Each of these suits has 3 Face cards- Jack, Queen and King. Therefore, in all there are 4 * 3 = 12 face cards. Probability of getting 1st face card = 12/52 Probability of getting 2nd face card = 11/51 Probability of getting 3rd face card = 10/50 Hence, probability of getting 3 face cards = (12/52) * (11/51) * (10/50) = 11/1105 or 0.9954% Hope this makes things clear. 592 Views · View Upvoters   David Kenneth Richardson Answered Dec 9, 2016 · Author has 448 answers and 223.1k answer views There are four suites in a deck of cards and 3 face cards per suite.

There are 3 face cards in each suit (Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits in all, so there are 12 face cards in a deck of 52. The first card drawn you have 12/52 chance. If you draw a face card then the next draw there will be one less available in the remaining cards so the odds are 11/51. Then you must draw a third card from a deck with 10 remaining face cards out of 50 cards so the odds are 10/50. All three of these events must happen so the total odds are (12/52) * ( 11/51) * (10/50) = 0.00995 which is very close to 1/100. 892 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions Given a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of each event getting a king of diamonds?

From the 13 possible clubs, there are [math]\binom{13}{2}[/math] ways of picking 2 cards. From the 13 possible spades, there are 13 ways of picking the single card. From the 13 possible hearts, there are 13 ways of picking the single card. From the 13 diamonds, there are 13 ways of picking the single card. Multiply those numbers, and we have the number of hands that meet the conditions of this problem. [math]\dbinom{13}{2} \cdot 13^3 = 171366[/math] Then you divide that by how many ways there are to chose 5 cards from the whole deck of 52.

We’ll define event A as the probability that we draw at least one king; event B as the probability of drawing no kings. [math]P(A) = 1 - P(B)[/math] This holds because the only way not to draw at least one king, is to draw zero kings. Thus [math]P(A) + P(B) = 1[/math] . On the first draw, we must avoid 4 (kings) out of the total 52 cards; the second we must avoid 4 of the remaining 51; and on the last draw we must avoid 4 of the remaining 50: [math]P(B) = \dfrac{52–4}{52} * \dfrac{51–4}{51} * \dfrac{50–4}{50} [/math] [math]P(B) = \dfrac{4324}{5525}[/math] [math]P(A) = 1 - P(B) = \dfrac{1201}{5525}[/math] [math]P(A) =[/math] ~ [math].22[/math] or [math]22%[/math] Another way to solve this problem would be to enumerate all the different ways we could draw 1, 2, 3, or 4 kings. 1.3k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions Three cards are pulled from a deck of 52 cards.

Sometimes you can rephrase the combinations to an equivalent number that is easier to calculate, but I don't see a way to do that in this case. As a result you will just have to sum up the result for each independent partition. There are 12 face cards, 4 threes, and 36 other cards. Here is the total combinations for the partition [math][2,1,4][/math] for precisely 2 face cards, 1 three, and 4 other cards  [math]\binom{12}{2}\binom{4}{1}\binom{36}{4} =66\cdot4\cdot58905=15,550,920[/math] You need to add that to the combos for the other partitions: [3,1,3],[4,1,2],[5,1,1],[6,1,0],[2,2,3],[3,2,2],[4,2,1],[5,2,0],[2,3,2],[3,3,1],[4,3,0],[2,4,1],[3,4,0].

The combination of 3 from 52. So these are all of our “ possible events ”; One club can be drawn from a pile of 13 clubs in [math]13C1[/math] ways (13) and the remaining two -which are not clubs- are drawn from the pile of the remaining 39 “non clubs” in [math]39C2 [/math] ways (741), so we multiply both and we have that one club can be drawn in 9,633 ways. Two clubs can be drawn from a pile of 13 clubs in [math]13C2[/math] ways (78) and the remaining -which is not a club- in [math]39C1 [/math] ways (39), so we multiply both and have that two clubs can be drawn in 3,042 ways. Three clubs can be drawn from a pile of 13 clubs in [math]13C3[/math] ways: 286 ways. The ways of getting one club or two clubs or three clubs (add the results) is 12,961 . And these are our “favorable events ”. Then, dividing favorable by possible: [math]12961/22100[/math] is 0.586. *A faster way, as other answers suggest, is to get how many ways is there to get zero clubs and then subtract from 1.

Thread starter  domino     Start date  Sep 15, 2008                      D      domino  New Member  Sep 15, 2008   #1        Sep 15, 2008   #1       I'm trying to figure out an algorithm to calculate the odds of being dealt 3 of a particular suit in a multi deck situation.  Assume we have 3 decks [156 cards] with 39 of each suit.  A player gets dealt 3 random cards.  How do I calculate the odds of all three of these being the same suit?  What if 30 cards are missing, but we know what suits the 30 cards [ex: 10 clubs, 4 hearts 9 spades 7 diamonds] are?  How would you adjust said algorithm to compensate?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.                        N      Navaak  New Member  Sep 15, 2008   #2        Sep 15, 2008   #2       Ok, here goes... sorry for the annotation, if it is kind of vague.  Assume you want to take k items out of n items, without caring about the order. Then the possible ways to do this are, according to probability theory, n!/(k!*(n-k)!).  So, let us assume you need to be dealt specifically 3 spades out of 156 cards. Since there are 39 spades in total, there are 39!/(3!*36!)=9139 ways to do this. Note that I used the number of spades, not total number of cards, as n . Now, the sample space (the possible ways to pull any 3 cards from a pool of 156 cards) is 156!/(3!*153!)=620620. Therefore, the probability to be dealt 3 spades is: P("3 spades")= 9139/620620 = 0.014725597, which is, by the way, quite low.  However, we do not specifically need spades, but any 3 cards that are the same suit. Since the possibilities of being dealt 3 spades, or 3 diamonds, or 3 clubs, or 3 hearts are all independent, we can simply add them:  P("3 of same suit")=P("3 spades")+P("3 diamonds")+P("3 clubs")+P("hearts")=4*P("3 spades")=0.058902388, because all suits have the same probability to be dealt.  Now, for the second part, things get a little more interesting, but still easy to calculate. Instead of using 39!/(3!*36!) and 156!/(3!*153!), use the numbers you define. In your example, where 30 cards are missing, of which 9 are spades, the probability to be dealt 3 spades is: (30!/(3!*27!))/(126!/(3!*123!)). Note that both the total nmber of spades and the total number of cards has to be modified.  You can calculate the probabilities for the rest of the suits in the same way. I hope this helps                        D      domino  New Member  Sep 15, 2008   #3        Sep 15, 2008   #3       thanks navaak, this is exactly what i was looking for.

For example, the probability of choosing one card, and getting a certain number card (e.g. a 7) or one from a certain suit (e.g. a club).  You might wonder why you’re learning about cards (what’s the point?). The answer is that finding probabilities (like the probability of contracting an illness) can be a tricky concept to grasp at first. So your instructor will try and simplify problems using cards, dice or Bingo numbers. Once you’ve grasped the basics, you’ll start to use “real life” data for probability (usually a bit later on in the class, for example in normal distributions ). Here’s how to find the probability of picking something in a couple of simple steps.  Probability of picking from a deck of cards: Steps    Step 1:  figure out the total number of cards you might pull. Write down all the possible cards and mark the ones that you would pull out (in our case we’ve been asked the probability of a club or a seven so we’re going to mark all the clubs and all the sevens):  hearts: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10, j, q, k, A  clubs: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, j, q, k, A  spades: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10, j, q, k, A  diamonds: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10, j, q, k, A  This totals 16 cards. * Step 2:  Count the total number of cards in the deck(s) . We have one deck, so the total = 52 Step 3:  Write the answer as a fraction .  Divide step 3 by Step 4:  16 / 52 That’s it! Tip : It isn’t as easy as just adding the number of sevens (4) and the number of clubs (13). If you did this for this example, you’d get 17 cards, not the correct answer of 16. The reason for this is that one of the cards in our example is both a club AND a number 7. Probability of picking from a deck of cards: Using Excel Watch the video or read below:  It gets a LOT more complex if you’re playing a card game, you have a certain number of cards in your hand, and you want to know your odds of getting a certain card if you are drawing a certain number of cards. You have to use something called a hypergeometric distribution to figure out the odds. The formula is: H (n) = C (X, n) * C (Y – X, Z – n) / C (Y, Z) Where: X is the number of a certain card in the deck Y is the total number of cards in the deck Z is the number of cards drawn N is the number you are checking for As you can see, the formula uses combinations and factorials — it can get a bit messy to do this by hand, so consider using technology like Excel. The command in Excel is: “=HYPGEOMDIST(N,Z,X,Y)”. For example, if you have a standard 52 card deck and draw 4 cards, what will be your chances of not drawing an ace? X is 4 Y is 52 Z is 4 N is 0 (as you want zero aces!) the formula would be: =HYPGEOMDIST(0,4,4,52) you will get the chance for not drawing the card. Like the explanation?

I take a deck and start turning over cards, one at a time.  Calling out the number..so the first card is an ace, second is 2 etc. jack is 11, queen 12, king 13 then back to ace.  I can’t get through whole deck without hitting the same card as the number.  I.e. The fifth card is a 5. Or the 11th card is a jack.  What are the odds/chances of getting through the deck without hitting the same card?  I tried many times, but never made it.          Andale November 9, 2016 at 10:02 am    The odds are practically nil You have a 4/52 = 1/13 chance of losing on the first draw (an ace comes up). On the second draw, you have a 1/13 chance of turning a two (assuming you didn’t pick a 2 in round 1). If you did pick a 2 the odds still aren’t good (3/52). When you go down the list like this, you should be able to see there’s practically a zil chance of making it to the end. If you want to get an algorithm, it might be easier to start with 12 cards to see the pattern more clearly (I don’t know of an algorithm for this!)          B.

Tom April 5, 2017 at 7:38 pm    Pick four cards from a regular deck without replacement.

As you don’t replace, probability of a heart on pick two is 12/51. The probability of getting a heart on round three is 12/50. The probability of getting a heart on round four is 12/49. So, total probability = 1/13 * 12/49          Sierra Show October 1, 2017 at 7:59 am    In the example, where X=4, Y= 52, Z=4,& N=0, I understand everything except why does X=4?
