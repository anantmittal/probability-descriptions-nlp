Other Tracking Stolen Car Tips  Way 1. Use Security Camera Systems to Find Your Stolen Car  When your car is stolen from the dealership, driveway, garage, valet parking, or a mechanic shop, you should check the security camera footage at once. Security camera video recordings are one of the best ways to find your stolen car and vehicle .                      Dual-Band Wireless Security Camera – RLC-410WS  The World’s First Dual-Band WiFi Security Camera (2.4/5 GHz); 1440p; Audio Recording; Built-in SD Card; Installed Outdoors & Indoors.          Learn More    Go to Amazon           One of the most welcomed features of security camera systems is 24/7 continuous recording (the system typically comes with multiple cameras & an NVR or DVR for local storage).  Some standalone security cameras can offer motion detection recording or continuous surveillance (if you keep running the security camera client 24/7). Thus you won’t miss any important events.  If you park your car near your home, your security cameras will record everything happening to your car. Check all of your home security cameras, especially the one in your garage.  Nothing can escape security cameras “detective eyes”. With the car thief’s clear images, and his general escape route, the likelihood of finding your stolen car will significantly increase.  Moreover, you can ask for the permission to check your community’s security camera systems. If your car is stolen in your community, security camera systems will record the trace of your stolen car. A stolen Chevrolet Silverado car owner got his car back by checking a primary school’s security camera systems. All in all, don’t forget this effective way when your car is stolen.   Security cameras are extremely effective on deterring car thieves. You can watch the video below to see how a security camera stops a car theft. If you haven’t installed a security camera for your car and home, it’s time to add one.   Way 2. Call Every Cab Company When Your Car Is Stolen  Cab drivers can help trace your stolen cars, trucks and vehicles. Whatever the situation is, calling all the cab companies in the area where your car is stolen while left running or parking is definitely a good option to find your stolen car.  Taxi drivers seriously outnumber police, thus increasing chances of finding your missing car. Besides, you should give enough reward, such as $100, to the taxi driver who finds your stolen car.  Reward is an incentive to encourage more people to join your stolen vehicle search team, which increases the possibility of recovering your stolen car.  Way 3. Check the City’s Transportation Website for Parking Violation When Your Car Was Stolen  You can track down your stolen car online via checking the parking violation. When your car was stolen, the car thief would park your car somewhere and then abandoned it.  The car was ticketed and put into the parking violation database, which is available online apparently. You can check if your stolen vehicle is in this database and then go to the area where the violation takes place. After that, contact the police immediately, they will search your car and then release it to you if they find it.  Way 4. Check for Your Stolen Car’s Parts Being Sold Online When Your Car Has Been Stolen  You can find your stolen car online if the car thief sells your car on the Internet. If your car has been parted out, finding who is selling those parts could lead you to recover your wheeled baby.  You can use automated checking system, such as Craigslist checker, to track down your stolen vehicle. If you can identify parts from your stolen car, make sure that you contact the police before arranging any meeting with the seller. Car thieves are dangerous guys. Accompanied by the police, you can get your stolen car back more safely and smoothly.  Way 5. Find Your Stolen Car with VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) If Your Car Is Stolen  When your car is stolen, you can locate your stolen vehicle with the VIN. A vehicle identification number (VIN) is a unique code used by vehicle industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, etc. You can track a stolen car online with the vehicle identification number.  VIN not only helps you check if your car is stolen, but also plays an important role on recovering your stolen car. First, go to AutoCheck , and purchase vehicle history report. The cost of the report will be between $30 and $40.  Enter your vehicle identification number and credit card details on the vehicle history report search screen, and you will see a chronological history of the places where your car was registered, titled and serviced.  The last known registration or service should be the most recent location of your stolen vehicle. Thus you can narrow down the search range when your car is stolen, and get your car back fast.  Other Tips You Can Try to Find Your Stolen or Missing Car and Reduce Your Loss  When you car has been stolen, you can also consider the following ways to find your stolen vehicle and reduce your loss.  Tip 1 . Call the police and file a report at once when your car is stolen (especially with your child or baby, dog inside).  When you file a police report, make sure you can provide enough information about your missing car, including the license plate (the police may help you find your stolen car with the license plate), the brand, the place where you last saw your car, and other related details.  The more details you provide, the higher chances that the police can help you retrieve your missing car.  Tip 2 . Use GPS vehicle and car tracking system . Some car owners install GPS car tracking system, like OnStar, LoJack, etc. to secure their cars, especially those expensive cars, such as Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, etc.  If you install this vehicle tracking system, you can know your car location where it got stolen, and then you can trace your hijacked car quickly.  When your car is stolen on test drive, or from dealership while getting repaired, or parking in a shopping mall garage or other places, you can track the stolen vehicle with the GPS.  Tip 3 . Contact your insurance company besides calling the police. Hope you have bought insurance for your car. If your car is lost, your insurance company will compensate for your loss.  Tip 4.

Are Stolen Cars Covered by Insurance?  A 1 : If you have comprehensive insurance for your car, you can get compensation from the insurance company. You need to purchase both collision and comprehensive coverage so that you can get compensation if your car is stolen, vandalized or damaged.  2. How Long Does It Take for the Insurance Company to Pay out on Your Stolen Car?  A 2 : If you’ve had the comprehensive insurance for your car, you should file a “car stolen” insurance claim at once. The insurance company will investigate the case before paying out for your loss.  Car insurance companies typically have a waiting period of 30 days, before they will pay a stolen car claim, as it gives time to see if the car would be recovered.  If your car is recovered but comes back damaged, the car insurance company will determine whether the car can be repaired or is a total loss. If your vehicle is considered as a total loss, you’ll get the actual cash value of your car from the company.  If your stolen car reappears after your insurance settlement, your insurance company will retain the ownership of the vehicle. The vehicle would be sold for salvage or at an auction.  You can buy your stolen car back if the laws and the insurance company’s guidelines allow.  3. What Are the Percentage of Stolen Cars Are Covered?  A 3 : According to Progressive Insurance’s report, the US average rate for car theft recovery is 46%, but the rate varies greatly among states.

The US average rate for car theft recovery is 46 percent, but the state-by-state rates of recoveries vary greatly. Washington, the top state for stolen-vehicle recoveries, found 71 percent of them. It was followed by Utah (63 percent), South Dakota (61 percent), Nevada (61 percent) and California (60 percent). Michigan, the bottom-performing state for recoveries, found just 19 percent of stolen vehicles , and was preceded by Pennsylvania (26 percent), Arkansas (28 percent), Alabama (28 percent) and Mississippi (29 percent).  Progressive claims trainer Todd Golling, a former Virginia State Trooper, says there are a number of ways that car owners can help prevent their cars from being stolen, including removing valuable items from the car when it's parked, locking it every time it's left somewhere and keeping a blanket to cover items when out shopping. All of that, or avoid owning a four-wheel-drive crew cab Ford F-250 Super Duty , which experiences the highest rate of insurance theft claims of any vehicle in the US, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute.

Does where you live increase the likelihood your car will be found if it's stolen? Progressive Insurance examined its 2012 Personal Lines data to answer those questions and more. The car insurance company found:  - A 15% increase in car thefts during the months of July and August, versus the rest of the year - July was the month with the highest percentage of theft claims, followed by August and June - Nine out of 10 of the highest car theft dates occurred between July and September -Dates, in order of the number of stolen car claims, are 7/15 (highest day for claims in 2012), 7/1, 4/29, 9/4, 7/23, 8/26, 9/15, 7/7, 9/23 and 8/12 - Cars were most likely to be stolen on a weekend, with the highest day for stolen car claims being Sunday, followed by Saturday  The data also showed how likely cars were to be recovered. While on average a car was recovered roughly 46% of the time, the state-by-state recovery rate varied greatly. In Washington, the highest state for recovery, cars were recovered 71% of the time. In Michigan, the lowest state for recovery, cars were recovered just 19% of the time.  - The top five highest states for vehicle recovery in 2012 were: - Washington (71%) - Utah (63%) - South Dakota (61%) - Nevada (61%) - California (60%) - The lowest five states for vehicle recovery in 2012 were: - Michigan (19%) - Pennsylvania (26%) - Arkansas (28%) - Alabama (28%) - Mississippi (29%)  So how do you prevent your car from being stolen? Progressive Claims Trainer and former Virginia State Trooper Todd Golling is an expert on break-ins, and has advice on how to deter thieves from targeting your car for theft, or a break-in.  "Thieves are lazy, so if you do anything to make their job more difficult, they'll move on to the next car," said Golling. "Even if you don't have a car alarm, if you have a sticker that says you do, your car becomes a less likely target."  Golling also offers this advice about where to be extra careful with your car.  "Anywhere that you'll be parked for a long time - churches, sports venues, concerts, etc. - are targets for car thieves," continued Golling. "That applies to the theft of the car itself and items in the car. Remove everything from your car when you're at those kinds of places."  Below are some best practices from Todd Golling to make your car less of a target.  1. Rule #1: If you don't want it stolen, don't leave it in your car. Simple as that. A visible iPod or GPS is a temptation for "smash and grab." 2. Rule #1 is particularly important when traveling. Remove everything from your car at a hotel. Thieves patrol hotel parking lots and look for things like out of state plates, or suction-cup marks on the windshield to indicate a GPS device might be in the car. 3. It sounds simple, but make sure you lock your car. Even if you're only leaving it unattended for a minute. 4. If you go on a shopping trip, keep a blanket in your car to cover the items you buy. Thieves are less likely to take the risk of breaking into your car if they don't know what they're getting. 5. Don't keep spare keys to your car or house anywhere in your car. 6. Don't leave anything with your address on it i.e. mail, registration, insurance card. 7. Locking gas caps, wheel-locking nuts, and engine immobilizers are a great way to tell the thief "It's not going to be easy!"

You park your car, go about your business, whether it’s shopping or an afternoon at the playground with the kids, only to return to find your car gone. Here’s an astounding statistic—every 44 seconds a motor vehicle is stolen in the United States. This number, courtesy of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , serves as a reminder that everyone who owns a vehicle needs to be aware of the danger of theft. And there are several factors that increase the chances of having your car stolen, including the time of year. Take a look:  Summertime  Ahhh, summertime, the best time of year! The season when the days are longer, the kids have no school and the whole family can enjoy beach days and barbecues, among other relaxing outdoor activities. But it’s also the time of year when car thieves are on the prowl. And during July and August, they are most successful at swiping your wheels . Here’s why:  • Cracked windows: Lots of us leave our car windows cracked during the summer months to keep the car cooler but this is an open invitation to thieves, making it easier for them to break in and get away.  • Open garages: Another summertime habit that many folks don’t realize can increase their chances of having their vehicle stolen: Leaving the garage door open, even just a few inches, gives thieves easier access to your car.  • Vacation state-of-mind: It’s hard not to get into that total relaxation mode when it’s summertime. Especially if you’re on a road trip. But being a bit to carefree when it comes to locking up your vehicle, whether at a rest stop or at your hotel, is just what crooks are looking for.  A false sense of security  You wouldn’t be alone if you assumed that because you don’t own a luxury vehicle like a Cadillac or a Porsche you are safe from being a victim of a car thief. And while statistics do show that higher-priced vehicles are more often stolen than other cars, the reality is that any vehicle can be stolen, and even older models are attractive to thieves for various reasons.  For example, Honda and Toyota models from the 1990s are often targeted because they don’t have the theft protection or tracking devices that the newer cars do. Another important aspect to consider is the fact that crooks will often steal a car for parts, because many of the older cars have parts that can be used on other cars , making them more valuable. Honda and Toyota parts, for example, are interchangeable, so they rank high on the list of stolen vehicles each year.  Take preventative measures  No matter what kind of car you have or how old it is, it’s a good idea to take steps to prevent it from being stolen. After all, you need your vehicle every day and losing it is more than inconvenient – it’s often costly. Here are some ways you can decrease your chances of becoming a victim:  Use common sense: Don’t leave your keys in your car or the engine running, even if you’re just running into the house for a second  Lock it up: Always lock your vehicle, even in your own driveway and in your garage  Roll up windows: Don’t leave them cracked, even an inch is an invite to thieves  Park smart: Park in well-lit areas  Invest in theft deterrents: Buy a steering wheel lock, get your vehicle ID number etched into your window (police stations often offer this for free), get an ignition disabler that disables the car in the event that someone tries to hotwire it, get smart keys that are coded so the car won’t start without them, and invest in an audible alarm that is motion activated to deter thieves.  What to do if your car is stolen  If your car is stolen, the first thing to do is call the police and have your title, registration, mileage at the time of the theft, and a complete description of the vehicle and what was inside (any personal property) ready. You’ll also want to give the police a list of all those who had keys and access to the car. Next, call your insurance company and report the theft immediately to get your claim started. Also, if you’re financing or leasing your car, you’ll need to call your financing company right away.  Make sure you’re covered  Being aware of the risks of car theft and taking precautions will help you decrease the chances of your vehicle being stolen. But because nothing is foolproof, make sure that you have adequate auto insurance . Your policy should cover both theft and damages to the vehicle in the event that it is recovered but has been damaged in the process of being stolen.

Just awful. But, as I learned not long ago, it's not entirely hopeless. I did get (most) of my stolen car back , and I learned a great deal in the entire process. So, in hopes of giving a little bit of that goodness back, here's what I took away from the experience of recovering a stolen car. How The Internet Found My Stolen Beetle Here&apos;s the most incredible thing about today: my prized Beetle has had its eyes gouged out,… Read more Read I am, of course, aware that as a writer for a popular automotive website, I had a huge advantage over most people stuck in this unenviable position. I had a very large megaphone with which I could complain and cry and plead for help, and that was absolutely crucial. But those of you out there with you know, real jobs can still take advantage of most of the same things I did, and hopefully will have equally positive results. We've covered the basics of what to do if your car is stolen before, but since that time — as recent as that was — social media's role in righting wrongs and solving problems has exploded, and that's good news. So here's what I learned: What To Do When Your Car Gets Stolen One of the worst things that can happen to you is having your car stolen. To take the guessing out… Read more Read Advertisement 1. Call the cops, do everything by the book, but don't rely on the police to find your car. First, I just want to make it clear that the LAPD was very friendly and helpful in the entire process. Also, thanks to some connections I've made in the course of my job, I got a bit better attention than I think most folks would. But that still didn't change the fact that the police weren't the ones to find my car. Advertisement Police departments, especially ones in large cities like LA, really have better things to do with their time than find all the stolen cars. They just aren't equipped to give everyone the attention they deserve. And, while that can be infuriating, it is what it is. So while you need to report the theft and involve the police from the start, the responsibility for locating your car is really your own. Here's what Detective Wilson, the nice and capable detective I was working with, told me himself: I see that you recovered your vehicle. It sounded like you had the help of the "community." That is they way it is supposed to be. People see something going on, they take action. At least they call the cops and are good wits. Further, they help out where they can. From the messages you left it sounded like some one who knew about the theft saw the car and let everyone know. That is outstanding. The city has millions of people but only thousands of cops. People don't realize how important they can be... Advertisement The police like it when communities act like ours did a few weeks back. People looking out for one another is probably the best way to stop crime, and it sure as hell helped me. So, involve the cops, keep them updated, but you need to be your own detective. 2. Let everyone know! The reason I got my car back was because I made a big deal about it. I talked about it every chance I could, and, even more importantly, threw as many pictures of it online as possible. I really, really wanted it back, and so I didn't shut my big yapper about it. You should do the same. Get the word (and pictures) out about your car everywhere you can — car forums, local neighborhood websites, Craigslist, everywhere. Send your pleas to me, as well! I feel like I owe a karmic debt to the general car-community for all their help, so I'll try and get stolen car notices on Jalopnik as much as I can. We probably can't do every one ever, but I'll do my best. Advertisement The key here is to get as many people in the area where your car may be thinking about your car at least somewhere back in their brains, so if that car gets spotted, something is triggered and they'll be able to let you know. So they need to know what it is and what it looks like. Take pictures. In fact, go take lots of pictures of your car right now, just in case. Well, wash it first. Make sure you have an easy path for people to get ahold of you as well — email, phone, whatever. You may end up giving up some of your normal privacy levels in this process (I posted my phone number in the comments, like a desperate madman) but it could be the difference between someone getting ahold of you or not. Advertisement 3. Get as many real eyes on the roads looking for your car as you can. In theory, the cops will be looking, but more often than not they're going to have much bigger, tastier fish to fry. You need a small army of eyeballs roaming the streets looking for your car. So, find the people who roam the streets. I went to all the municipal tow companies that service my area of LA. I gave my car's picture to the dispatcher and passed out flyers to the drivers as well. I offered a small but decent monetary reward to the driver and dispatcher on duty who found the car, and made sure the dispatcher had my number to call me if it was seen. They were all very receptive and helpful, and the dispatcher of one company was a former Beetle owner himself, so he was especially enthusiastic about helping out. People are generally very good about this. Advertisement Also, you'll want to get in good with the local tow yards in case your abandoned car ends up in them. They'll be more likely to call you when they find it if they already have a relationship with you, and that could save you a lot of money in storage fees. There's lots of options for this aside from tow companies — try cab companies , pizza or other food delivery companies, postal carriers — anyone whose job involves lots of driving around. The more eyes around, the more chances of your car being seen. If Your Car Is Ever Stolen, Have Cab Companies Help You Find It Hopefully you&apos;ll never need to use this information, but just in case: The first calls you… Read more Read Advertisement 4. Don't forget about the robot eyes! We live in a surprisingly well-surveilled society, and while there's all kinds of issues associated with that, it could help you recover your car. One of the first things I did was to check my neighborhood for cameras. I have an elementary school right across from my house, and they'd be in a perfect position to have recorded the actual act of snake-in-the-grass thievery itself.  Sadly, crappy education budgets meant they had no cameras, but still, you may be luckier than me. Advertisement Check every building around your area for cameras. Most businesses will have them — gas stations, grocery stores, small shops, pretty much anything. I did find one grocery store that had street-facing cameras on what I learned was the route where my car was taken, and they were willing to let me review the footage. Luckily, my car was found before I had to do that, but you get the idea. The key here is you should act quickly on this one, because many security camera systems re-record their footage on short cycles— sometimes daily. So, find the cameras and ask for the footage to be saved, if possible, as soon as you can after you find your car stolen. What you find in the footage may or may not help recover the car, but any information helps. Advertisement 5. Check for parts being sold online This was one of the most popular suggestions, and one of the things people were very good about helping out with. If your car has been parted out, finding who's selling those parts could be what leads you back to your wheeled baby. Advertisement Of course, distinctive parts are easier to spot, and are also possibly less likely to be publicly offered for sale as a result. But sometimes the thieves aren't aware of what they have, or just aren't that bright. So it's worth checking. Using automated checking systems, like this on-the-hour Craigslist checker , can help take care of this process for you. If you're able to identify parts from your car, make sure you contact police before arranging any meeting with the seller. The police can and should accompany you in these situations, and they have experience doing this safely and discreetly. Remember, these are car-stealing bastards you're dealing with. They're could be dangerous, and at the very least they're probably ugly and smell bad. Advertisement 6. Don't give up. I absolutely understand how much a car can mean personally to someone. We all know these aren't like other machines in our lives, so if the car had that kind of value to you, be ready to put in the effort and time to find it. It may not happen, true, but it's a lot more likely to be found if you and a supportive community are involved. Advertisement The real key here is as car people, we're a community, and it's the community that will eventually find these stolen cars. This is what Detective Wilson emailed me after reading the posts about my Beetle: Thank you for the thanks but I/we didn't do anything. It was you not giving up and it was all the people who gave a poo... (Yes I have kids and it has affected my language...) So, it's all about us, in deference to the Detective's kids, giving a poo. And I think we do that very well.

Colorado State Patrol Chief Colonel Scott Hernandez            U.S. Auto Theft Statistics  The FBI reports there were an estimated 699,594 motor vehicle thefts nationwide in 2013. In 2012, a small increase in vehicle thefts ended a consecutive eight-year run of decreasing thefts. However, the 2013 data shows thefts are once again on the decline.  Auto theft is covered by the optional "comprehensive" coverage on your auto policy.  Despite the reduction in vehicle thefts over the past two decades, industry observers caution that thieves constantly devise new and sophisticated means of stealing autos. Tactics include acquiring smart keys, which eliminated hot-wiring to steal cars; switching vehicle identification numbers; and using stolen identities to secure loans for expensive vehicles.  According to the FBI, a motor vehicle is stolen in the United States every 44 seconds.  A survey of American drivers conducted in April 2007 on behalf of the National Insurance Crime Bureau and LoJack , a manufacturer of an electronic vehicle tracking and recovery system, found:   79% always lock their vehicles.  93% never leave spare keys in their vehicle.   However, the survey also found:   One-third admit they have left their car while it was running, which makes the vehicle an easy target for theft.  47% don't always park in a well-lit area.  40% don't hide their valuables. In fact, nearly half leave mail in their vehicle, a quarter have left a purse or wallet, and almost a third have left bank statements, all of which can put them at risk for identity theft.   Although 75% of respondents know that there are costs associated with vehicle theft in addition to paying the insurance   deductible and the cost of replacing the vehicle that are not covered by insurance, virtually none knew that there are additional costs   such as insurance premium increases, the cost of time spent dealing with police, vehicle rental costs, and the cost of time off from work. The survey was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation.

Does It Matter Where I Live? Living in urban and higher crime areas has an impact on your risk of being a victim of auto theft. Port and border cities continue to be boomtowns for the auto theft business. Of the top 25 metro areas in the nation for vehicle theft, nearly half are ports or communities with easy access to borders (* National Insurance Crime Bureau , or NICB). The NICB study compares the auto theft rates per 100,000 population in 380 metro areas. The top 10 metro areas with highest auto theft rates in 2014:  San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, California  Bakersfield, California  Stockton-Lodi, California  Odessa, Texas  Modesto, California  Spokane-Spokane Valley, Washington  Vallejo-Fairfield, California  Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Washington  Fresno, California  San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California  City-by-city differences in auto buying habits are reflected in the preferences of auto thieves. For example, American vehicles tend to be the auto thief's vehicles of choice in Detroit and Chicago; pickups are popular in Albuquerque, Phoenix and Houston; and Japanese models lead the most commonly stolen list in Los Angeles.

That is 147 vehicles in a day!1  What does this mean for you? Well, it means that no matter who you are, if you drive a vehicle, it’s at risk of being stolen. It also means that the best way to prevent losing several thousand dollars worth of property is to take the necessary precautions to ensure that your vehicle is safe and secure at all times.  The Facts  Not locking your car, even when it is at home or in your garage, can result in stolen documentation, garage door remotes, or even vehicles. Leaving vehicle or home windows open, even during the hot summer months, may result in burglars being able to quickly enter and exit without ever being noticed. Placing keys in easily visible or obvious locations could lead to those keys being taken by home intruders, and used at later dates.  Understanding the data associated with car theft can help you better prepare your own property to withstand car thieves. We’d like to showcase nine interesting Australian car-theft statistics, and provide a little bit of insight along the way.  53,954 households were victims of vehicle theft in Australia in the 2013/2014 financial year 3 .   When compared to many other countries, Australia has a very low number of annual car thefts (the United States had an estimated 699,594 vehicle thefts in 2013 alone 4 ). On the other hand, 53,954 still amounts to hundreds of millions per year in losses. Those that fail to recognise this fact put themselves in danger of becoming complacent, and those who act complacently in regards to vehicle security often make things much simpler for potential thieves.  All vehicles 25 years old or newer are required to have immobilisers 5 .  Immobilisers are special security devices that are installed in vehicles. These devices make it impossible to manually activate a car engine without the use of a specific key. This effectively eliminates ‘hot-wiring’ as a vehicle theft method. So how is it that over 50,000 vehicles were stolen in 2013/2014? The answer is very simple: Thieves are now targeting car keys first. Car owners who leave their keys in easily-accessible locations may be increasing their likelihood of having a vehicle stolen.  Theft due to unlocked cars has become such a problem that police in some areas are now issuing fines 6 .  Unlocked cars may also be a tempting target for thieves, even when those cars are fitted with immobilisers. This is because many thieves will attempt to steal things such as garage door remotes in an effort to get into an owners home. Once inside, they can then search for car keys, as well as other valuables. Thieves may also enter an unlocked car in search of personal identification or official vehicle documentation, which can be used in identity-theft related crimes.  An estimated 53 passenger and light-commercial vehicles are stolen each week in Australia for conversion into scrap metal 2 .  Many car owners assume that because the cars they drive are neither new nor flashy, that they needn’t be concerned with potential car theft. The reality is that not every car that is stolen is being considered for resale; many stolen vehicles are taken simply because they can be dismantled into valuable scrap metal. Owners of older or less-expensive vehicles who fail to take the same precautions as owners of new vehicles put themselves in danger of losing a car, and never being able to recover it.  It is estimated that approximately 21 passenger and light-commercial vehicles are stolen and exported from Australia each week 2 .  Of those vehicles that are not converted into scrap, many don’t even remain in Australia after being taken. When this occurs, the chances of recovering the vehicle in question become practically nonexistent. Vehicle owners who rely on recovery methods rather than on prevention methods may find that there is nothing left of a stolen vehicle worth recovering.  Assuming that each stolen car contained an average of ½ tank of petrol, car thefts in Australia amounted to an additional $500,000 in fuel-related losses in 2013/2014 2 .  Although the price of petrol has been declining in recent months, there are few who would be willing to claim that fuel is ‘inexpensive.’ And while half a tank of petrol (or even a full tank of petrol) may not make that much of a difference when one has already lost a several-thousand-dollar vehicle, the cost of lost fuel does add up quickly. Those who don’t take adequate precautions against vehicle theft often stand to lose money in ways that aren’t covered by basic insurance policies.  Of all types of vehicles, stolen motorcycles have the lowest rate of recovery, with only 43 per cent of reported thefts being recovered 7 .   Although the recovery rate of stolen vehicles in Australia is fairly high (approximately 75 per cent of stolen passenger and light commercial vehicles are eventually recovered), motorcycles are much more difficult to recover. As such, motorcyclists who fail to take precautions to defend against theft (such as installing motorcycle alarms, locking the ignition, and locking the bike to some stationary and immovable object) are much less likely to have a stolen vehicle returned to them.  2.9 percent of Australian households experienced theft of property from a motor vehicle in 2013/2014 8 .  Even among vehicle owners who use immobiliser devices and keep their keys in safe, secure locations, there are those who experience vehicle break-ins. Why? Well, often it’s because they make the mistake of keeping valuable objects in the vehicle. Wallets, electronic devices, jewellery, and even clothing and jackets can be attractive prizes to thieves. Unlocked and unsupervised cars which contain such items are easy targets, and some thieves will even be willing to break a window to get to some of the more expensive items. Those who leave valuables sitting visible in their cars often discover that even when a thief can’t steal a car, he or she will often settle for stealing from a car.  About 47 percent of stolen vehicles are stolen from either the home of the owner, or from the home of an friend of the owner 9 .  People tend to assume that when a vehicle is at home, it’s safe. This is simply not true. In fact, the reason that such a high percentage of vehicles are stolen from homes may well be that owners fall into a false sense of security, and fail to take precautions. Car theft can strike anywhere; when vehicle owners forget that, they set themselves up to become victims.  Protecting your car: the basics  Knowing the facts, you may be wonder what it is that you can do to decrease the risk of becoming victimised. The good news is that you have many options, and when it comes to protecting your vehicle, advanced, state-of-the-art theft-deterrent systems may not be necessary. In reality, some of the most effective deterrents are also the most basic. Here are seven simple ways to protect your car:   Keep the car locked. We touched on this briefly above, but your car’s door locks are the first, and often the most vital theft deterrent system that your vehicle has. Breaking into a locked vehicle requires time and know-how, and as such, many thieves prefer to simply move on until they can find something more accessible. Don’t let your car be the easy option for a criminal who doesn’t know how to pick a lock; always lock your car, even when it’s parked in front of your home or even in your garage.  Keep all of your windows completely closed when the car is unattended. Much like unlocked doors, open windows (even when only opened a small amount), provide thieves with an easy point of access to the inside of your vehicle. It’s much easier to pry open a window that is partially opened than it is to open one that is completely closed.  Never leave your keys inside of your car. If there’s one thing more attractive to a car thief than an unlocked door, it’s a vehicle with the keys inside. Once a criminal get’s a hold of a car’s ignition key, there’s really not much else that can be done to prevent the criminal from escaping with the car. Refrain from hiding any keys—even spare keys—in your vehicle, because thieves with any real experience will know exactly where to look for them.  Don’t keep important vehicle documents in the car. Many of us tend to keep our vehicle titles and registrations in our cars for easy access. However, a thief who gains access to these documents will have a much easier time selling your vehicle. Instead, keep your title filed away someplace secure—such as your home or office—and keep your registration information on your person (such as in a purse, handbag, or wallet).  Keep your emergency brake engaged whenever your car is parked. Some thieves prefer to tow a vehicle away rather than brake into it and attempting to drive it away. An engaged emergency brake makes towing much more difficult.  Be sure to hide any valuables. Once again, keeping valuable items—such as computers, smart devices, wallets, jewellery, etc.—in your vehicle is inherently risky, and you should refrain from doing so whenever possible. However, if you absolutely must leave something of value in your car, be sure that it’s not sitting in plain-sight. Hiding valuables under seats, in the glove compartment, or even underneath a jacket or blanket is often enough to keep thieves from becoming too interested.  Park in well lit areas. The last thing a thief wants when attempting to break into a car is to rouse attention. To this end, try never to park your car in overly-shaded areas, or away from street lamps at night.

Don’t become a car theft statistic  The state of car theft in Australia  What to do if your car is stolen    Protecting your car: advanced techniques  Of course, there may also be situations in which a more-advanced theft deterrent system is appropriate. For those who live in areas with a high crime-rate, or those who simply want a little bit more peace of mind, these additional security measures may make all of the difference. Here are seven advanced theft deterrent techniques you might consider:   Engine immobilisers. Immobilisers are theft deterrent systems that cut access to one or more vehicle systems (such as the starter, ignition, or fuel supply), and which automatically arm when a vehicle is disengaged. Immobilisers provide an added defence against thieves who might attempt to ‘hot wire’ your car.  Bonnet locks. Some thieves aren’t after you car; they’re only after certain parts of your car. Criminals who gain access to the inside of your bonnet can help themselves to a number of vital and valuable components, many of which (such as the car battery) can be quickly and easily removed. A bonnet lock is a mechanism that is mounted externally on the car, and basically acts as a deadbolt for your engine compartment. And, in addition to reinforcing your vehicle’s existing latch, it also serves as a visual deterrent, warning thieves away before they choose to commit themselves.  Wheel locks. These are basically civilian versions of the wheel locks used by the police to immobilise suspended vehicles. The lock clamps down securely around the vehicle’s tyre, making it impossible for the car to be moved. Visually, wheel locks function very well, forcing all but the most determined thieves to admit defeat. Unfortunately, wheel locks may be just as much of a hassle for vehicle owners, who will have to take the time to engage and disengage the lock by hand before and after every drive.  Steering-wheel locks. Functioning in much the same way as wheel locks, steering-wheel locks stretch across a car’s steering wheel, securing it in place so that the wheel cannot be turned. The lock is engaged and disengaged with a key, and required a bit less effort to use than the locks that fit around vehicle’s tyres.  Car alarms. Car alarms are probably the most widespread theft deterrent systems, and often come standard in various vehicle models. Alarms do little to actively prevent car theft from taking place, but instead are designed to scare thieves away by calling attention to the theft.  VIN etching. Every legally manufactured car is assigned a unique identification number, which is then displayed on the vehicle interior (such as on the dashboard, or on the inner door frame). This makes it much easier for authorities to track and recover stolen vehicles. However, vehicles that are stolen and then dismantled in order to have their components sold off individually don’t have the same protection. By having your car’s VIN etched into the individual components, you can extend VIN protection to every part of your vehicle.  GPS tracking. Stolen cars that feature GPS trackers are often recovered within hours of the theft. This is because GPS trackers give real-time location updates, which can be relayed to local law enforcement agencies. Some newer vehicles are being manufactured with GPS trackers built in, but for other car’s these devices have to be purchased and installed, and often require the purchase of an on-going service plan from the provider.  Kill switch. Having gained a certain amount of notoriety after being featured on a number of police reality television programs, vehicle kill switches are devices that allow owners to shut down their vehicles remotely, such as in the event of a theft. Once activated, these devices prevent the vehicle in question from being able to operate until it is deactivated by the owner.   Simple preventative measures, such as those outlined may mean the difference between keeping your car, and having it taken from you. Make sure you have a Car insurance policy if the worst does happen.  At the same time, understanding the data associated with car theft can help you better prepare your own property to withstand the rorting attempts made by car thieves.   1 https://ncars.on.net/dashboard.aspx#tab1 2 http://ncars.on.net/docs/infographic_12_mvt_facts_2014.pdf 3 http://roadahead.com.au/news/latest/homes-high-risk-car-theft/ 4 http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/november/crime-statistics-for-2013-released/crime-statistics-for-2013-released 5 http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/immobilisers.asp 6 http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/eastern-suburbs-motorists-to-be-slugged-148-for-leaving-cars-unlocked-in-police-operation-covering-manningham-whitehorse-monash-and-booroondara/story-fngnvlxu-1226993787541 7 http://ncars.on.net/docs/annual/annual_2013_14_web.pdf 8 http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4530.0 9 http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4530.0main+features262012-13           Looking for smarter  Car Insurance?

Other Tracking Stolen Car Tips  Way 1. Use Security Camera Systems to Find Your Stolen Car  When your car is stolen from the dealership, driveway, garage, valet parking, or a mechanic shop, you should check the security camera footage at once. Security camera video recordings are one of the best ways to find your stolen car and vehicle .                      Dual-Band Wireless Security Camera – RLC-410WS  The World’s First Dual-Band WiFi Security Camera (2.4/5 GHz); 1440p; Audio Recording; Built-in SD Card; Installed Outdoors & Indoors.          Learn More    Go to Amazon           One of the most welcomed features of security camera systems is 24/7 continuous recording (the system typically comes with multiple cameras & an NVR or DVR for local storage).  Some standalone security cameras can offer motion detection recording or continuous surveillance (if you keep running the security camera client 24/7). Thus you won’t miss any important events.  If you park your car near your home, your security cameras will record everything happening to your car. Check all of your home security cameras, especially the one in your garage.  Nothing can escape security cameras “detective eyes”. With the car thief’s clear images, and his general escape route, the likelihood of finding your stolen car will significantly increase.  Moreover, you can ask for the permission to check your community’s security camera systems. If your car is stolen in your community, security camera systems will record the trace of your stolen car. A stolen Chevrolet Silverado car owner got his car back by checking a primary school’s security camera systems. All in all, don’t forget this effective way when your car is stolen.   Security cameras are extremely effective on deterring car thieves. You can watch the video below to see how a security camera stops a car theft. If you haven’t installed a security camera for your car and home, it’s time to add one.   Way 2. Call Every Cab Company When Your Car Is Stolen  Cab drivers can help trace your stolen cars, trucks and vehicles. Whatever the situation is, calling all the cab companies in the area where your car is stolen while left running or parking is definitely a good option to find your stolen car.  Taxi drivers seriously outnumber police, thus increasing chances of finding your missing car. Besides, you should give enough reward, such as $100, to the taxi driver who finds your stolen car.  Reward is an incentive to encourage more people to join your stolen vehicle search team, which increases the possibility of recovering your stolen car.  Way 3. Check the City’s Transportation Website for Parking Violation When Your Car Was Stolen  You can track down your stolen car online via checking the parking violation. When your car was stolen, the car thief would park your car somewhere and then abandoned it.  The car was ticketed and put into the parking violation database, which is available online apparently. You can check if your stolen vehicle is in this database and then go to the area where the violation takes place. After that, contact the police immediately, they will search your car and then release it to you if they find it.  Way 4. Check for Your Stolen Car’s Parts Being Sold Online When Your Car Has Been Stolen  You can find your stolen car online if the car thief sells your car on the Internet.

Find Your Stolen Car with VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) If Your Car Is Stolen  When your car is stolen, you can locate your stolen vehicle with the VIN. A vehicle identification number (VIN) is a unique code used by vehicle industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, etc. You can track a stolen car online with the vehicle identification number.  VIN not only helps you check if your car is stolen, but also plays an important role on recovering your stolen car. First, go to AutoCheck , and purchase vehicle history report. The cost of the report will be between $30 and $40.  Enter your vehicle identification number and credit card details on the vehicle history report search screen, and you will see a chronological history of the places where your car was registered, titled and serviced.  The last known registration or service should be the most recent location of your stolen vehicle. Thus you can narrow down the search range when your car is stolen, and get your car back fast.  Other Tips You Can Try to Find Your Stolen or Missing Car and Reduce Your Loss  When you car has been stolen, you can also consider the following ways to find your stolen vehicle and reduce your loss.  Tip 1 . Call the police and file a report at once when your car is stolen (especially with your child or baby, dog inside).  When you file a police report, make sure you can provide enough information about your missing car, including the license plate (the police may help you find your stolen car with the license plate), the brand, the place where you last saw your car, and other related details.  The more details you provide, the higher chances that the police can help you retrieve your missing car.  Tip 2 . Use GPS vehicle and car tracking system . Some car owners install GPS car tracking system, like OnStar, LoJack, etc. to secure their cars, especially those expensive cars, such as Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, etc.  If you install this vehicle tracking system, you can know your car location where it got stolen, and then you can trace your hijacked car quickly.  When your car is stolen on test drive, or from dealership while getting repaired, or parking in a shopping mall garage or other places, you can track the stolen vehicle with the GPS.  Tip 3 . Contact your insurance company besides calling the police. Hope you have bought insurance for your car. If your car is lost, your insurance company will compensate for your loss.  Tip 4.

Are Stolen Cars Covered by Insurance?  A 1 : If you have comprehensive insurance for your car, you can get compensation from the insurance company. You need to purchase both collision and comprehensive coverage so that you can get compensation if your car is stolen, vandalized or damaged.  2. How Long Does It Take for the Insurance Company to Pay out on Your Stolen Car?  A 2 : If you’ve had the comprehensive insurance for your car, you should file a “car stolen” insurance claim at once. The insurance company will investigate the case before paying out for your loss.  Car insurance companies typically have a waiting period of 30 days, before they will pay a stolen car claim, as it gives time to see if the car would be recovered.  If your car is recovered but comes back damaged, the car insurance company will determine whether the car can be repaired or is a total loss. If your vehicle is considered as a total loss, you’ll get the actual cash value of your car from the company.  If your stolen car reappears after your insurance settlement, your insurance company will retain the ownership of the vehicle. The vehicle would be sold for salvage or at an auction.  You can buy your stolen car back if the laws and the insurance company’s guidelines allow.  3. What Are the Percentage of Stolen Cars Are Covered?  A 3 : According to Progressive Insurance’s report, the US average rate for car theft recovery is 46%, but the rate varies greatly among states.

Contact Us  Our Credentials  ALOA Code of Ethics  You are here: Home  /  Resources  / How To Decrease The Odds of Having Your Car Stolen (and how to get it back if it is stolen) How To Decrease The Odds of Having Your Car Stolen (and how to get it back if it is stolen)  August 9, 2014 by Jim · The first and foremost thing to remember is that one should utilize their existing hardware, and look for optimum conditions for parking their car. In other words, ALWAYS lock your doors,  ALWAYS roll up your windows, and always try your best to park in a secure, well lit, and preferably busy area. The efforts you take to prevent car theft from taking place will reap massive returns in overall prevention itself. Thieves are opportunists: If an opportunity does not exist, or requires just a little too much effort to “make the opportunity unfold”, so to speak, then this exponentially decreases chances of vehicle theft. There are too many cars out there, parked in remote areas, with their doors unlocked and keys in the ignition, just begging to be stolen. So simply don’t include your vehicle in that group.  You should always consider supplementing your basic safety efforts, though:   Consider a subscription to a service like On-Star or BMW Assist if your manufacturer offers one . Many of these services have Stolen Vehicle Location and Recovery Assistance and can remotely track and locate your vehicle while communicating with police to help aid in recovery. Get Lojack if your area has Lojack coverage . Lojack is only sold in areas where the police are equipped with Lojack scanners, and does not require a monthly or yearly fee. Chances are if you can buy Lojack in your area, you have coverage. Lojack is a vehicle tracking system that allows police to directly track a stolen vehicle from their police cruisers. This is done directly by the police, without the need of a 3rd party like On-Star to tell them the location.  Get a car security or alarm system with 2 way paging remotes that will notify your remote of your vehicles condition . If the alarm is triggered your remote will alert you of the alarm. Also ECarSecurity offers the Vision Guard 8000 which actually takes a picture from inside the car during the alarm triggering. This picture will quickly be sent to your remote and can help identify a thief.    Consider a 3rd party GPS or GPS/Cellular based tracking system . Most of these have a monthly fee, and will allow to see the location of the vehicle through the companies tracking site or other means. This allows you or them to communicate with the police the location of the stolen vehicle, and some allow you to see the location from your computer as well. This is similar to many fleet-monitoring systems.    Report the theft to police as soon as you find out . The longer a thief has with the car, the longer the thief has to find, remove and disable any OEM or aftermarket tracking system.    Consider going to a watchdog website .    Make sure to etch your VIN in your window . If you have nice aftermarket wheels, stereo equipment, or any other parts you worry about, consider etching your VIN number somewhere inconspicuous (like on the backside or inside lip) of these too. It can make it easier to recover your vehicle and parts. You can ask the dealership for a place that does this.     Tips    On-Star, BMW Assist and other similar manufacturer assistance systems offer many different plans. When purchasing a car, be sure to check if your manufacturer offers such services for their vehicles. To be sure you can effectively use these systems to help attempt recovery of a stolen vehicle, make sure to select a plan that features some sort of Stolen Vehicle Recovery. Most of the monthly or yearly plans will include this, but it never hurts to be sure before you sign up.  Lojack offers an “early Warning system” as well. Consider paying extra for this. This helps inform you quicker of the theft of your vehicle. Through the extra technology, you will be contacted by your chosen method (cell, email, text message, phone call, etc.) the moment the thief drives your car away. This allows you to contact the authorities sooner, increasing chances of recovery.  Some 3rd party GPS tracking systems offer different features than others. Some offer a system with early warning as well. Some can be combined with regular alarm systems to aid in prevention as well as recovery. Understand the way it is set up, and available options and systems thoroughly before purchasing a system, to make sure it’s the right one for you. Remember to pay the monthly fee, your expensive GPS tracking system that requires a monthly fee for the monitoring. Like a cell phone, it won’t be effective if you don’t have a service provider. There are many more types available.  Get a car alarm with 2 way paging remotes for further protection over your vehicle. You can also opt to get a system like the Vision Guard 8000 which will actually take pictures and send it to your remote!  StolenCarReports.com alerts are sent out to people in your area through email and SMS to cell phones. These people will look for your car and call the cops to pick up your ride.  Make sure to etch your VIN in your window. Makes it easier to recover your vehicle.      Warnings    Be careful about etching your car’s VIN number on your window if your car is an older Honda because it easier to steal your car if the thief knows the VIN number.

However new research suggests that once a car is stolen it’s owners stand little chance of ever seeing it again.  If your pride and joy is stolen, chances are you’ll never see it again.  The total number of vehicle thefts fell from 347,000 in 1991 to just 95,681 in 2011, but the proportion of recovered vehicles is on the slide. In 2002, 70 per cent of cars were recovered, with that figure dropping to 51 per cent in 2008. According to the latest numbers from RetainaGroup , that number decreased again in 2011 to a mere 41 per cent.  There are a number of reasons why fewer vehicles are being recovered, chiefly the fact there are now far fewer police officers dedicated to stolen vehicle recovery. According to the Telegraph, the number of police recovery teams has fallen from about 50 two decades ago to just four today, as the force faces budget cuts.  Other reasons, as outlined by Dr Ken German, an ex-member of the New Scotland Yard Stolen Car Squad, include a change in the behaviour of thieves. “Once, when cars were easier to steal, many thefts were by so-called joyriders,” said Dr German. “Vehicles were often stolen for parts, too, as they sometimes are now. Today the big money is in high-value cars for illegal export. Large but unknown numbers are shipped abroad to fund organised crime.”  So it’s clear, then, that your stolen Mercedes or BMW is not in the hands of common thieves but is more likely being packed into a shipping crate destined for Africa, Cyprus, Dubai and the Far East, Pakista, the Middle East, Spain and Eastern Europe, where demand for stolen vehicles is high.  Don’t make the mistake of thinking your high-end car’s security system will keep it safe. Thieves have a number of ways of getting their hands on your pride and joy – with techniques involving everything from stealing the keys from your home to electronically programming a blank key fob to start your engine.  There is some good news to all this, particularly for those of us who own relatively cheap cars. Thieves tend to target expensive luxury vehicles rather than old bangers, so your little runabout stands a great chance of being recovered. Renault, Rover and Fiat are the most likely cars to be found after a theft, with 72.8, 72.7 and 69 per cent recover rates, respectively.

Continue Reading Below Most vehicles are taken because the owners are careless or much too trusting. If you want to avoid losing your set of wheels, start "thinking like a bad guy," advises crime-prevention consultant Art Adkins. Thinking like a thief means looking for crimes of opportunity, explains Adkins, a police lieutenant in Gainesville, Fla. Before you walk away from your parked car, ask yourself: *Is your car an attractive theft target where it&apos;s parked? *How easy have you made it for someone to break in? *Have you bothered to use an anti-theft device? Advertisement Law enforcement agencies and car insurance companies try to educate consumers about the best ways to keep their vehicles safe. "The crime triangle works on three things," says Adkins. "One point is the suspect, one is the victim and one is opportunity. Opportunity is what we have to eliminate." No one method is foolproof, but the more layers of security you create, the greater the chance that a car thief simply will move on to an easier target, says Michelle Staton, executive director of the Pennsylvania Auto Theft Prevention Authority. If you prefer to live dangerously, here are six things guaranteed to put your car at high risk of being stolen. 1. Leave your car doors unlocked This may sound like a no-brainer, but many auto thefts happen when people forget to lock their doors. A locked door is the first line of defense. "About 50% of cars stolen are left unlocked and sometimes have the keys in the ignition," says Staton. Most car thieves won&apos;t bother breaking into a locked car when there are so many unlocked autos to choose from, says Frank Scafidi,  spokesperson for the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). 2. Park your car in dark, deserted areas When it comes to choosing a safe place to park, trust your instincts, Adkins says. Most of us know that dark, isolated spots are more likely to attract car thieves. However, when you&apos;re late for a movie and all the best parking places are taken, it&apos;s easy to ignore the voice within. Adkins urges you to go with your gut reaction. "If you think it is in a bad location, more than likely it is," he says. 3. Don&apos;t use anti-theft devices The more barriers you create to theft, the safer your car will be. Although they are low-tech, old-fashioned and relatively cheap, steering wheel locks remain an effective deterrent. "For a passive thief, a Club can make them go on to the next vehicle," explains Carole Walker, executive director of the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association in Colorado. Some people prefer audible alarms that draw attention to vehicles that are being tampered with. Smart keys with computer chips come standard in some new cars. Another good anti-theft device is an ignition kill switch that prevents thieves from starting your motor. It may sound like closing the barn door after the horses have escaped, but auto-tracking devices are available that can help law enforcement officials find stolen cars using satellite and cell tower technology. Also, anti-theft systems often bring discounts that lower your auto insurance quotes . 4. Drop your guard when you get home Many people take precautions against car theft while traveling, but become complacent when they return to the familiarity of their own neighborhoods. That&apos;s a big mistake, says Sgt. John Delaney, a spokesperson for the Springfield, Mass., Police Department. "A lot of people have the misconception that if it is parked in their driveway it is safe," he says. "They leave the doors open, windows down, keys in the car. It is an open invitation for someone to jump in the car and get going." Always lock your car and use anti-theft devices, even when parked at home. If you have a garage, use it and keep it locked. 5. Assume that your old beater is safe from theft No matter how old and beat up your car is, you can never completely rule out the possibility of theft. "Many times [old cars] are easier to break into," says Walker says. "Many times these models are stolen for parts, because they are easy to sell on the stolen parts market." Staton says parts from a dismantled car may sell for much more than the car could command if sold intact. In some cases, criminals don&apos;t care about the value of the car they&apos;re stealing. They simply need temporary transportation. 6. Leave your motor running When the weather is hot, you may be tempted to leave your vehicle running to keep the air conditioning powered while you dash into a bank or convenience store. In such cases, you may end up paying a big price for trying to keep cool. It only takes seconds for an observant thief to jump inside your unattended car. In cold weather, thieves also target cars that have been left running in driveways to warm up. Your valuables are a neon sign After you&apos;ve taken steps to avoid auto theft, make sure you&apos;ve done nothing to encourage someone to burglarize your vehicle. Adkins says many people foolishly leave money, GPS devices and packages from high-end retail stores visible in their cars. For a thief, that&apos;s an invitation that&apos;s hard to resist. "Those are like neon signs," warns Adkins. "When you walk into a store, you are looking for a sale. That is how the bad guys shop. They are looking for visual cues." Take the time to put valuables out of sight in your car&apos;s trunk, he advises. If you have a minivan or SUV that lacks a secure trunk, cover valuable items with a blanket. Insuring against auto theft When you shop for car insurance rates , remember that you need to buy comprehensive auto insurance in order to be covered in case your vehicle is stolen, vandalized, burned or damaged by weather.

Other Tracking Stolen Car Tips  Way 1. Use Security Camera Systems to Find Your Stolen Car  When your car is stolen from the dealership, driveway, garage, valet parking, or a mechanic shop, you should check the security camera footage at once. Security camera video recordings are one of the best ways to find your stolen car and vehicle .                      Dual-Band Wireless Security Camera – RLC-410WS  The World’s First Dual-Band WiFi Security Camera (2.4/5 GHz); 1440p; Audio Recording; Built-in SD Card; Installed Outdoors & Indoors.          Learn More    Go to Amazon           One of the most welcomed features of security camera systems is 24/7 continuous recording (the system typically comes with multiple cameras & an NVR or DVR for local storage).  Some standalone security cameras can offer motion detection recording or continuous surveillance (if you keep running the security camera client 24/7). Thus you won’t miss any important events.  If you park your car near your home, your security cameras will record everything happening to your car. Check all of your home security cameras, especially the one in your garage.  Nothing can escape security cameras “detective eyes”. With the car thief’s clear images, and his general escape route, the likelihood of finding your stolen car will significantly increase.  Moreover, you can ask for the permission to check your community’s security camera systems. If your car is stolen in your community, security camera systems will record the trace of your stolen car. A stolen Chevrolet Silverado car owner got his car back by checking a primary school’s security camera systems. All in all, don’t forget this effective way when your car is stolen.   Security cameras are extremely effective on deterring car thieves. You can watch the video below to see how a security camera stops a car theft. If you haven’t installed a security camera for your car and home, it’s time to add one.   Way 2. Call Every Cab Company When Your Car Is Stolen  Cab drivers can help trace your stolen cars, trucks and vehicles. Whatever the situation is, calling all the cab companies in the area where your car is stolen while left running or parking is definitely a good option to find your stolen car.  Taxi drivers seriously outnumber police, thus increasing chances of finding your missing car. Besides, you should give enough reward, such as $100, to the taxi driver who finds your stolen car.  Reward is an incentive to encourage more people to join your stolen vehicle search team, which increases the possibility of recovering your stolen car.  Way 3. Check the City’s Transportation Website for Parking Violation When Your Car Was Stolen  You can track down your stolen car online via checking the parking violation. When your car was stolen, the car thief would park your car somewhere and then abandoned it.  The car was ticketed and put into the parking violation database, which is available online apparently. You can check if your stolen vehicle is in this database and then go to the area where the violation takes place. After that, contact the police immediately, they will search your car and then release it to you if they find it.  Way 4. Check for Your Stolen Car’s Parts Being Sold Online When Your Car Has Been Stolen  You can find your stolen car online if the car thief sells your car on the Internet. If your car has been parted out, finding who is selling those parts could lead you to recover your wheeled baby.  You can use automated checking system, such as Craigslist checker, to track down your stolen vehicle. If you can identify parts from your stolen car, make sure that you contact the police before arranging any meeting with the seller. Car thieves are dangerous guys. Accompanied by the police, you can get your stolen car back more safely and smoothly.  Way 5. Find Your Stolen Car with VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) If Your Car Is Stolen  When your car is stolen, you can locate your stolen vehicle with the VIN. A vehicle identification number (VIN) is a unique code used by vehicle industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, etc. You can track a stolen car online with the vehicle identification number.  VIN not only helps you check if your car is stolen, but also plays an important role on recovering your stolen car. First, go to AutoCheck , and purchase vehicle history report. The cost of the report will be between $30 and $40.  Enter your vehicle identification number and credit card details on the vehicle history report search screen, and you will see a chronological history of the places where your car was registered, titled and serviced.  The last known registration or service should be the most recent location of your stolen vehicle. Thus you can narrow down the search range when your car is stolen, and get your car back fast.  Other Tips You Can Try to Find Your Stolen or Missing Car and Reduce Your Loss  When you car has been stolen, you can also consider the following ways to find your stolen vehicle and reduce your loss.  Tip 1 . Call the police and file a report at once when your car is stolen (especially with your child or baby, dog inside).  When you file a police report, make sure you can provide enough information about your missing car, including the license plate (the police may help you find your stolen car with the license plate), the brand, the place where you last saw your car, and other related details.  The more details you provide, the higher chances that the police can help you retrieve your missing car.  Tip 2 . Use GPS vehicle and car tracking system . Some car owners install GPS car tracking system, like OnStar, LoJack, etc. to secure their cars, especially those expensive cars, such as Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, etc.  If you install this vehicle tracking system, you can know your car location where it got stolen, and then you can trace your hijacked car quickly.  When your car is stolen on test drive, or from dealership while getting repaired, or parking in a shopping mall garage or other places, you can track the stolen vehicle with the GPS.  Tip 3 . Contact your insurance company besides calling the police. Hope you have bought insurance for your car. If your car is lost, your insurance company will compensate for your loss.  Tip 4. Use “Find Stolen Car” app . You can check the helpful apps here to find the missing vehicle with your iPhone or Android smartphone when your car is stolen.  What to do when your car is stolen?

Car insurance companies typically have a waiting period of 30 days, before they will pay a stolen car claim, as it gives time to see if the car would be recovered.

If your vehicle is considered as a total loss, you’ll get the actual cash value of your car from the company.  If your stolen car reappears after your insurance settlement, your insurance company will retain the ownership of the vehicle. The vehicle would be sold for salvage or at an auction.  You can buy your stolen car back if the laws and the insurance company’s guidelines allow.  3. What Are the Percentage of Stolen Cars Are Covered?  A 3 : According to Progressive Insurance’s report, the US average rate for car theft recovery is 46%, but the rate varies greatly among states.

Having guidelines and sets of steps can help immensely. A suddenly absent car certainly qualifies as traumatic, and victims often feel lucky if they remember where they keep their auto insurance card. We hope you never have to use the following checklist, but if your car is stolen, we hope it helps: If your car is stolen – Quoted’s Checklist : 1. Make sure your car has really been stolen. It sounds silly, but we’ve been there: standing in the spot you’re sure you parked in, panicking, feeling the cold sweat of dread, then remembering you actually parked on the next block, or one level up in the parking garage. So take a minute, breathe, and think. Another possibility: your car’s been towed. You might save yourself some heartache (and paperwork) if you check the police impound before making a stolen vehicle report. 2. Call the police. If you haven’t misplaced your ride, and you haven’t been towed, you might actually be in the stolen-car boat. In that case, call the police ASAP (the sooner you call, the more likely your car will be recovered). You’ll need to file a police report in which you tell them everything about your car: the VIN number (now would be a good time to write it down and keep the info anyplace but in your car), your car’s make and model, and where you last had your vehicle. If you have a tracking device, like LoJack or OnStar, give the police that information as well. Once you’ve made the police report, be sure to keep a copy on file (you’ll need for your insurance claim).  A small comfort: More than 85% of stolen vehicles are recovered. Share on Twitter 3. Call your car insurance carrier and report your car stolen. Report your car stolen no matter what type of auto insurance policy you have: your insurance company will need to know you aren’t in possession of your vehicle. What happens after you report the car stolen to your insurer depends on what kind of insurance policy you carry. Most insurance policies that only cover the state minimum requirements won’t include reimbursement for a stolen vehicle. State minimums (which vary by state, so check yours for further details ) almost always only cover expenses you as the driver would be responsible for in the event that you cause a wreck: if you’re at fault, your state minimum policy will cover medical expenses and repair expenses for the other party–and that’s pretty much it. If you want insurance coverage for your vehicle if you’re at fault, or if your car is stolen, vandalized, damaged by “ acts of God ” or weather, you’ll need comprehensive auto insurance. As we’ve discussed , comprehensive insurance covers vehicle damage caused by non-collision events, like the ones listed above. Different policies from different insurance companies will, of course, have different levels of coverage , so you’ll need to check yours to know exactly what to expect in the unfortunate event your vehicle is stolen. How much coverage you need depends on how much your vehicle is worth, and how much of that value you want replaced. If you’re feeling underinsured, shop around and compare policies, making sure to speak directly with insurance agents to clarify coverage. Having comprehensive insurance doesn’t guarantee an immediate payout, so be prepared for delays. First, the insurance company will investigate. The hard truth is that the vehicle owner is the number one suspect when a car is stolen, so the insurance company will have to rule out fraud before they pay a claim. Second, most insurers impose a waiting period (anywhere from two to eight weeks) to see if the stolen vehicle is recovered before paying your claim. If everything checks out, you’re looking at a total loss claim, and your insurer will reimburse you for the actual cash value (ACV) of the car: how much you paid, minus depreciation. You’ll then receive payment for the ACV minus your deductible. Keep in mind that the ACV is negotiable: insurance adjusters usually begin at the low end of a vehicle’s value, so arm yourself with research (you can find good ACV calculators at Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds.com ) and don’t be afraid to negotiate. 4. Report the car stolen to your DMV. The DMV keeps a database of stolen cars and often works with the police to reunite a recovered vehicle with its rightful owner. 5. Take matters into your own hands. If waiting for the police proves too difficult, you can try searching for your car online, in places like Craigslist and other car selling forums. It might be a long shot (especially if you have a pretty common make and model), but finding your stolen car for sale online isn’t outside the realm of possibility. Finally, if you haven’t already, take a moment to cry, yell, stomp the floor—it helped when you were a kid and something unfair happened, and it’ll help now, too. And keep this number in mind: 87.8 (the percentage of stolen vehicles that were recovered in 2012, as reported by Esurance ). Have any other tips or suggestions for victims of car theft?

The US average rate for car theft recovery is 46 percent, but the state-by-state rates of recoveries vary greatly. Washington, the top state for stolen-vehicle recoveries, found 71 percent of them. It was followed by Utah (63 percent), South Dakota (61 percent), Nevada (61 percent) and California (60 percent). Michigan, the bottom-performing state for recoveries, found just 19 percent of stolen vehicles , and was preceded by Pennsylvania (26 percent), Arkansas (28 percent), Alabama (28 percent) and Mississippi (29 percent).  Progressive claims trainer Todd Golling, a former Virginia State Trooper, says there are a number of ways that car owners can help prevent their cars from being stolen, including removing valuable items from the car when it's parked, locking it every time it's left somewhere and keeping a blanket to cover items when out shopping. All of that, or avoid owning a four-wheel-drive crew cab Ford F-250 Super Duty , which experiences the highest rate of insurance theft claims of any vehicle in the US, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute.

Does where you live increase the likelihood your car will be found if it's stolen? Progressive Insurance examined its 2012 Personal Lines data to answer those questions and more. The car insurance company found:  - A 15% increase in car thefts during the months of July and August, versus the rest of the year - July was the month with the highest percentage of theft claims, followed by August and June - Nine out of 10 of the highest car theft dates occurred between July and September -Dates, in order of the number of stolen car claims, are 7/15 (highest day for claims in 2012), 7/1, 4/29, 9/4, 7/23, 8/26, 9/15, 7/7, 9/23 and 8/12 - Cars were most likely to be stolen on a weekend, with the highest day for stolen car claims being Sunday, followed by Saturday  The data also showed how likely cars were to be recovered. While on average a car was recovered roughly 46% of the time, the state-by-state recovery rate varied greatly. In Washington, the highest state for recovery, cars were recovered 71% of the time. In Michigan, the lowest state for recovery, cars were recovered just 19% of the time.  - The top five highest states for vehicle recovery in 2012 were: - Washington (71%) - Utah (63%) - South Dakota (61%) - Nevada (61%) - California (60%) - The lowest five states for vehicle recovery in 2012 were: - Michigan (19%) - Pennsylvania (26%) - Arkansas (28%) - Alabama (28%) - Mississippi (29%)  So how do you prevent your car from being stolen? Progressive Claims Trainer and former Virginia State Trooper Todd Golling is an expert on break-ins, and has advice on how to deter thieves from targeting your car for theft, or a break-in.  "Thieves are lazy, so if you do anything to make their job more difficult, they'll move on to the next car," said Golling. "Even if you don't have a car alarm, if you have a sticker that says you do, your car becomes a less likely target."  Golling also offers this advice about where to be extra careful with your car.  "Anywhere that you'll be parked for a long time - churches, sports venues, concerts, etc. - are targets for car thieves," continued Golling. "That applies to the theft of the car itself and items in the car. Remove everything from your car when you're at those kinds of places."  Below are some best practices from Todd Golling to make your car less of a target.  1. Rule #1: If you don't want it stolen, don't leave it in your car. Simple as that. A visible iPod or GPS is a temptation for "smash and grab." 2. Rule #1 is particularly important when traveling. Remove everything from your car at a hotel. Thieves patrol hotel parking lots and look for things like out of state plates, or suction-cup marks on the windshield to indicate a GPS device might be in the car. 3. It sounds simple, but make sure you lock your car. Even if you're only leaving it unattended for a minute. 4. If you go on a shopping trip, keep a blanket in your car to cover the items you buy. Thieves are less likely to take the risk of breaking into your car if they don't know what they're getting. 5. Don't keep spare keys to your car or house anywhere in your car. 6. Don't leave anything with your address on it i.e. mail, registration, insurance card. 7. Locking gas caps, wheel-locking nuts, and engine immobilizers are a great way to tell the thief "It's not going to be easy!"

You park your car, go about your business, whether it’s shopping or an afternoon at the playground with the kids, only to return to find your car gone. Here’s an astounding statistic—every 44 seconds a motor vehicle is stolen in the United States. This number, courtesy of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , serves as a reminder that everyone who owns a vehicle needs to be aware of the danger of theft. And there are several factors that increase the chances of having your car stolen, including the time of year. Take a look:  Summertime  Ahhh, summertime, the best time of year! The season when the days are longer, the kids have no school and the whole family can enjoy beach days and barbecues, among other relaxing outdoor activities. But it’s also the time of year when car thieves are on the prowl. And during July and August, they are most successful at swiping your wheels . Here’s why:  • Cracked windows: Lots of us leave our car windows cracked during the summer months to keep the car cooler but this is an open invitation to thieves, making it easier for them to break in and get away.  • Open garages: Another summertime habit that many folks don’t realize can increase their chances of having their vehicle stolen: Leaving the garage door open, even just a few inches, gives thieves easier access to your car.  • Vacation state-of-mind: It’s hard not to get into that total relaxation mode when it’s summertime. Especially if you’re on a road trip. But being a bit to carefree when it comes to locking up your vehicle, whether at a rest stop or at your hotel, is just what crooks are looking for.  A false sense of security  You wouldn’t be alone if you assumed that because you don’t own a luxury vehicle like a Cadillac or a Porsche you are safe from being a victim of a car thief. And while statistics do show that higher-priced vehicles are more often stolen than other cars, the reality is that any vehicle can be stolen, and even older models are attractive to thieves for various reasons.  For example, Honda and Toyota models from the 1990s are often targeted because they don’t have the theft protection or tracking devices that the newer cars do. Another important aspect to consider is the fact that crooks will often steal a car for parts, because many of the older cars have parts that can be used on other cars , making them more valuable. Honda and Toyota parts, for example, are interchangeable, so they rank high on the list of stolen vehicles each year.  Take preventative measures  No matter what kind of car you have or how old it is, it’s a good idea to take steps to prevent it from being stolen. After all, you need your vehicle every day and losing it is more than inconvenient – it’s often costly. Here are some ways you can decrease your chances of becoming a victim:  Use common sense: Don’t leave your keys in your car or the engine running, even if you’re just running into the house for a second  Lock it up: Always lock your vehicle, even in your own driveway and in your garage  Roll up windows: Don’t leave them cracked, even an inch is an invite to thieves  Park smart: Park in well-lit areas  Invest in theft deterrents: Buy a steering wheel lock, get your vehicle ID number etched into your window (police stations often offer this for free), get an ignition disabler that disables the car in the event that someone tries to hotwire it, get smart keys that are coded so the car won’t start without them, and invest in an audible alarm that is motion activated to deter thieves.  What to do if your car is stolen  If your car is stolen, the first thing to do is call the police and have your title, registration, mileage at the time of the theft, and a complete description of the vehicle and what was inside (any personal property) ready. You’ll also want to give the police a list of all those who had keys and access to the car. Next, call your insurance company and report the theft immediately to get your claim started. Also, if you’re financing or leasing your car, you’ll need to call your financing company right away.  Make sure you’re covered  Being aware of the risks of car theft and taking precautions will help you decrease the chances of your vehicle being stolen. But because nothing is foolproof, make sure that you have adequate auto insurance . Your policy should cover both theft and damages to the vehicle in the event that it is recovered but has been damaged in the process of being stolen.

Just awful. But, as I learned not long ago, it's not entirely hopeless. I did get (most) of my stolen car back , and I learned a great deal in the entire process. So, in hopes of giving a little bit of that goodness back, here's what I took away from the experience of recovering a stolen car.

I had a very large megaphone with which I could complain and cry and plead for help, and that was absolutely crucial. But those of you out there with you know, real jobs can still take advantage of most of the same things I did, and hopefully will have equally positive results. We've covered the basics of what to do if your car is stolen before, but since that time — as recent as that was — social media's role in righting wrongs and solving problems has exploded, and that's good news. So here's what I learned: What To Do When Your Car Gets Stolen One of the worst things that can happen to you is having your car stolen. To take the guessing out… Read more Read Advertisement 1. Call the cops, do everything by the book, but don't rely on the police to find your car. First, I just want to make it clear that the LAPD was very friendly and helpful in the entire process. Also, thanks to some connections I've made in the course of my job, I got a bit better attention than I think most folks would. But that still didn't change the fact that the police weren't the ones to find my car. Advertisement Police departments, especially ones in large cities like LA, really have better things to do with their time than find all the stolen cars. They just aren't equipped to give everyone the attention they deserve. And, while that can be infuriating, it is what it is. So while you need to report the theft and involve the police from the start, the responsibility for locating your car is really your own. Here's what Detective Wilson, the nice and capable detective I was working with, told me himself: I see that you recovered your vehicle. It sounded like you had the help of the "community." That is they way it is supposed to be. People see something going on, they take action. At least they call the cops and are good wits. Further, they help out where they can. From the messages you left it sounded like some one who knew about the theft saw the car and let everyone know. That is outstanding. The city has millions of people but only thousands of cops. People don't realize how important they can be... Advertisement The police like it when communities act like ours did a few weeks back. People looking out for one another is probably the best way to stop crime, and it sure as hell helped me. So, involve the cops, keep them updated, but you need to be your own detective. 2. Let everyone know! The reason I got my car back was because I made a big deal about it. I talked about it every chance I could, and, even more importantly, threw as many pictures of it online as possible. I really, really wanted it back, and so I didn't shut my big yapper about it. You should do the same. Get the word (and pictures) out about your car everywhere you can — car forums, local neighborhood websites, Craigslist, everywhere. Send your pleas to me, as well! I feel like I owe a karmic debt to the general car-community for all their help, so I'll try and get stolen car notices on Jalopnik as much as I can. We probably can't do every one ever, but I'll do my best. Advertisement The key here is to get as many people in the area where your car may be thinking about your car at least somewhere back in their brains, so if that car gets spotted, something is triggered and they'll be able to let you know. So they need to know what it is and what it looks like. Take pictures. In fact, go take lots of pictures of your car right now, just in case. Well, wash it first. Make sure you have an easy path for people to get ahold of you as well — email, phone, whatever. You may end up giving up some of your normal privacy levels in this process (I posted my phone number in the comments, like a desperate madman) but it could be the difference between someone getting ahold of you or not. Advertisement 3. Get as many real eyes on the roads looking for your car as you can. In theory, the cops will be looking, but more often than not they're going to have much bigger, tastier fish to fry. You need a small army of eyeballs roaming the streets looking for your car. So, find the people who roam the streets. I went to all the municipal tow companies that service my area of LA. I gave my car's picture to the dispatcher and passed out flyers to the drivers as well. I offered a small but decent monetary reward to the driver and dispatcher on duty who found the car, and made sure the dispatcher had my number to call me if it was seen. They were all very receptive and helpful, and the dispatcher of one company was a former Beetle owner himself, so he was especially enthusiastic about helping out. People are generally very good about this. Advertisement Also, you'll want to get in good with the local tow yards in case your abandoned car ends up in them. They'll be more likely to call you when they find it if they already have a relationship with you, and that could save you a lot of money in storage fees. There's lots of options for this aside from tow companies — try cab companies , pizza or other food delivery companies, postal carriers — anyone whose job involves lots of driving around. The more eyes around, the more chances of your car being seen. If Your Car Is Ever Stolen, Have Cab Companies Help You Find It Hopefully you&apos;ll never need to use this information, but just in case: The first calls you… Read more Read Advertisement 4. Don't forget about the robot eyes! We live in a surprisingly well-surveilled society, and while there's all kinds of issues associated with that, it could help you recover your car. One of the first things I did was to check my neighborhood for cameras. I have an elementary school right across from my house, and they'd be in a perfect position to have recorded the actual act of snake-in-the-grass thievery itself.  Sadly, crappy education budgets meant they had no cameras, but still, you may be luckier than me. Advertisement Check every building around your area for cameras. Most businesses will have them — gas stations, grocery stores, small shops, pretty much anything. I did find one grocery store that had street-facing cameras on what I learned was the route where my car was taken, and they were willing to let me review the footage. Luckily, my car was found before I had to do that, but you get the idea. The key here is you should act quickly on this one, because many security camera systems re-record their footage on short cycles— sometimes daily. So, find the cameras and ask for the footage to be saved, if possible, as soon as you can after you find your car stolen. What you find in the footage may or may not help recover the car, but any information helps. Advertisement 5. Check for parts being sold online This was one of the most popular suggestions, and one of the things people were very good about helping out with. If your car has been parted out, finding who's selling those parts could be what leads you back to your wheeled baby. Advertisement Of course, distinctive parts are easier to spot, and are also possibly less likely to be publicly offered for sale as a result. But sometimes the thieves aren't aware of what they have, or just aren't that bright. So it's worth checking. Using automated checking systems, like this on-the-hour Craigslist checker , can help take care of this process for you. If you're able to identify parts from your car, make sure you contact police before arranging any meeting with the seller. The police can and should accompany you in these situations, and they have experience doing this safely and discreetly. Remember, these are car-stealing bastards you're dealing with. They're could be dangerous, and at the very least they're probably ugly and smell bad. Advertisement 6. Don't give up. I absolutely understand how much a car can mean personally to someone. We all know these aren't like other machines in our lives, so if the car had that kind of value to you, be ready to put in the effort and time to find it. It may not happen, true, but it's a lot more likely to be found if you and a supportive community are involved. Advertisement The real key here is as car people, we're a community, and it's the community that will eventually find these stolen cars. This is what Detective Wilson emailed me after reading the posts about my Beetle: Thank you for the thanks but I/we didn't do anything. It was you not giving up and it was all the people who gave a poo... (Yes I have kids and it has affected my language...) So, it's all about us, in deference to the Detective's kids, giving a poo. And I think we do that very well.

Colorado State Patrol Chief Colonel Scott Hernandez            U.S. Auto Theft Statistics  The FBI reports there were an estimated 699,594 motor vehicle thefts nationwide in 2013. In 2012, a small increase in vehicle thefts ended a consecutive eight-year run of decreasing thefts. However, the 2013 data shows thefts are once again on the decline.  Auto theft is covered by the optional "comprehensive" coverage on your auto policy.  Despite the reduction in vehicle thefts over the past two decades, industry observers caution that thieves constantly devise new and sophisticated means of stealing autos. Tactics include acquiring smart keys, which eliminated hot-wiring to steal cars; switching vehicle identification numbers; and using stolen identities to secure loans for expensive vehicles.  According to the FBI, a motor vehicle is stolen in the United States every 44 seconds.  A survey of American drivers conducted in April 2007 on behalf of the National Insurance Crime Bureau and LoJack , a manufacturer of an electronic vehicle tracking and recovery system, found:   79% always lock their vehicles.  93% never leave spare keys in their vehicle.   However, the survey also found:   One-third admit they have left their car while it was running, which makes the vehicle an easy target for theft.  47% don't always park in a well-lit area.  40% don't hide their valuables. In fact, nearly half leave mail in their vehicle, a quarter have left a purse or wallet, and almost a third have left bank statements, all of which can put them at risk for identity theft.   Although 75% of respondents know that there are costs associated with vehicle theft in addition to paying the insurance   deductible and the cost of replacing the vehicle that are not covered by insurance, virtually none knew that there are additional costs   such as insurance premium increases, the cost of time spent dealing with police, vehicle rental costs, and the cost of time off from work. The survey was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation.

Does It Matter Where I Live? Living in urban and higher crime areas has an impact on your risk of being a victim of auto theft. Port and border cities continue to be boomtowns for the auto theft business. Of the top 25 metro areas in the nation for vehicle theft, nearly half are ports or communities with easy access to borders (* National Insurance Crime Bureau , or NICB). The NICB study compares the auto theft rates per 100,000 population in 380 metro areas. The top 10 metro areas with highest auto theft rates in 2014:  San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, California  Bakersfield, California  Stockton-Lodi, California  Odessa, Texas  Modesto, California  Spokane-Spokane Valley, Washington  Vallejo-Fairfield, California  Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Washington  Fresno, California  San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California  City-by-city differences in auto buying habits are reflected in the preferences of auto thieves. For example, American vehicles tend to be the auto thief's vehicles of choice in Detroit and Chicago; pickups are popular in Albuquerque, Phoenix and Houston; and Japanese models lead the most commonly stolen list in Los Angeles.

That is 147 vehicles in a day!1  What does this mean for you? Well, it means that no matter who you are, if you drive a vehicle, it’s at risk of being stolen. It also means that the best way to prevent losing several thousand dollars worth of property is to take the necessary precautions to ensure that your vehicle is safe and secure at all times.  The Facts  Not locking your car, even when it is at home or in your garage, can result in stolen documentation, garage door remotes, or even vehicles. Leaving vehicle or home windows open, even during the hot summer months, may result in burglars being able to quickly enter and exit without ever being noticed. Placing keys in easily visible or obvious locations could lead to those keys being taken by home intruders, and used at later dates.  Understanding the data associated with car theft can help you better prepare your own property to withstand car thieves. We’d like to showcase nine interesting Australian car-theft statistics, and provide a little bit of insight along the way.  53,954 households were victims of vehicle theft in Australia in the 2013/2014 financial year 3 .   When compared to many other countries, Australia has a very low number of annual car thefts (the United States had an estimated 699,594 vehicle thefts in 2013 alone 4 ). On the other hand, 53,954 still amounts to hundreds of millions per year in losses. Those that fail to recognise this fact put themselves in danger of becoming complacent, and those who act complacently in regards to vehicle security often make things much simpler for potential thieves.  All vehicles 25 years old or newer are required to have immobilisers 5 .  Immobilisers are special security devices that are installed in vehicles. These devices make it impossible to manually activate a car engine without the use of a specific key. This effectively eliminates ‘hot-wiring’ as a vehicle theft method. So how is it that over 50,000 vehicles were stolen in 2013/2014? The answer is very simple: Thieves are now targeting car keys first. Car owners who leave their keys in easily-accessible locations may be increasing their likelihood of having a vehicle stolen.  Theft due to unlocked cars has become such a problem that police in some areas are now issuing fines 6 .  Unlocked cars may also be a tempting target for thieves, even when those cars are fitted with immobilisers. This is because many thieves will attempt to steal things such as garage door remotes in an effort to get into an owners home. Once inside, they can then search for car keys, as well as other valuables. Thieves may also enter an unlocked car in search of personal identification or official vehicle documentation, which can be used in identity-theft related crimes.  An estimated 53 passenger and light-commercial vehicles are stolen each week in Australia for conversion into scrap metal 2 .  Many car owners assume that because the cars they drive are neither new nor flashy, that they needn’t be concerned with potential car theft. The reality is that not every car that is stolen is being considered for resale; many stolen vehicles are taken simply because they can be dismantled into valuable scrap metal. Owners of older or less-expensive vehicles who fail to take the same precautions as owners of new vehicles put themselves in danger of losing a car, and never being able to recover it.  It is estimated that approximately 21 passenger and light-commercial vehicles are stolen and exported from Australia each week 2 .  Of those vehicles that are not converted into scrap, many don’t even remain in Australia after being taken. When this occurs, the chances of recovering the vehicle in question become practically nonexistent. Vehicle owners who rely on recovery methods rather than on prevention methods may find that there is nothing left of a stolen vehicle worth recovering.  Assuming that each stolen car contained an average of ½ tank of petrol, car thefts in Australia amounted to an additional $500,000 in fuel-related losses in 2013/2014 2 .  Although the price of petrol has been declining in recent months, there are few who would be willing to claim that fuel is ‘inexpensive.’ And while half a tank of petrol (or even a full tank of petrol) may not make that much of a difference when one has already lost a several-thousand-dollar vehicle, the cost of lost fuel does add up quickly. Those who don’t take adequate precautions against vehicle theft often stand to lose money in ways that aren’t covered by basic insurance policies.  Of all types of vehicles, stolen motorcycles have the lowest rate of recovery, with only 43 per cent of reported thefts being recovered 7 .   Although the recovery rate of stolen vehicles in Australia is fairly high (approximately 75 per cent of stolen passenger and light commercial vehicles are eventually recovered), motorcycles are much more difficult to recover. As such, motorcyclists who fail to take precautions to defend against theft (such as installing motorcycle alarms, locking the ignition, and locking the bike to some stationary and immovable object) are much less likely to have a stolen vehicle returned to them.  2.9 percent of Australian households experienced theft of property from a motor vehicle in 2013/2014 8 .  Even among vehicle owners who use immobiliser devices and keep their keys in safe, secure locations, there are those who experience vehicle break-ins. Why? Well, often it’s because they make the mistake of keeping valuable objects in the vehicle. Wallets, electronic devices, jewellery, and even clothing and jackets can be attractive prizes to thieves. Unlocked and unsupervised cars which contain such items are easy targets, and some thieves will even be willing to break a window to get to some of the more expensive items. Those who leave valuables sitting visible in their cars often discover that even when a thief can’t steal a car, he or she will often settle for stealing from a car.  About 47 percent of stolen vehicles are stolen from either the home of the owner, or from the home of an friend of the owner 9 .  People tend to assume that when a vehicle is at home, it’s safe. This is simply not true. In fact, the reason that such a high percentage of vehicles are stolen from homes may well be that owners fall into a false sense of security, and fail to take precautions. Car theft can strike anywhere; when vehicle owners forget that, they set themselves up to become victims.  Protecting your car: the basics  Knowing the facts, you may be wonder what it is that you can do to decrease the risk of becoming victimised. The good news is that you have many options, and when it comes to protecting your vehicle, advanced, state-of-the-art theft-deterrent systems may not be necessary. In reality, some of the most effective deterrents are also the most basic. Here are seven simple ways to protect your car:   Keep the car locked. We touched on this briefly above, but your car’s door locks are the first, and often the most vital theft deterrent system that your vehicle has. Breaking into a locked vehicle requires time and know-how, and as such, many thieves prefer to simply move on until they can find something more accessible. Don’t let your car be the easy option for a criminal who doesn’t know how to pick a lock; always lock your car, even when it’s parked in front of your home or even in your garage.  Keep all of your windows completely closed when the car is unattended. Much like unlocked doors, open windows (even when only opened a small amount), provide thieves with an easy point of access to the inside of your vehicle. It’s much easier to pry open a window that is partially opened than it is to open one that is completely closed.  Never leave your keys inside of your car. If there’s one thing more attractive to a car thief than an unlocked door, it’s a vehicle with the keys inside. Once a criminal get’s a hold of a car’s ignition key, there’s really not much else that can be done to prevent the criminal from escaping with the car. Refrain from hiding any keys—even spare keys—in your vehicle, because thieves with any real experience will know exactly where to look for them.  Don’t keep important vehicle documents in the car. Many of us tend to keep our vehicle titles and registrations in our cars for easy access. However, a thief who gains access to these documents will have a much easier time selling your vehicle. Instead, keep your title filed away someplace secure—such as your home or office—and keep your registration information on your person (such as in a purse, handbag, or wallet).  Keep your emergency brake engaged whenever your car is parked. Some thieves prefer to tow a vehicle away rather than brake into it and attempting to drive it away. An engaged emergency brake makes towing much more difficult.  Be sure to hide any valuables. Once again, keeping valuable items—such as computers, smart devices, wallets, jewellery, etc.—in your vehicle is inherently risky, and you should refrain from doing so whenever possible. However, if you absolutely must leave something of value in your car, be sure that it’s not sitting in plain-sight. Hiding valuables under seats, in the glove compartment, or even underneath a jacket or blanket is often enough to keep thieves from becoming too interested.  Park in well lit areas. The last thing a thief wants when attempting to break into a car is to rouse attention. To this end, try never to park your car in overly-shaded areas, or away from street lamps at night.

Don’t become a car theft statistic  The state of car theft in Australia  What to do if your car is stolen    Protecting your car: advanced techniques  Of course, there may also be situations in which a more-advanced theft deterrent system is appropriate. For those who live in areas with a high crime-rate, or those who simply want a little bit more peace of mind, these additional security measures may make all of the difference. Here are seven advanced theft deterrent techniques you might consider:   Engine immobilisers. Immobilisers are theft deterrent systems that cut access to one or more vehicle systems (such as the starter, ignition, or fuel supply), and which automatically arm when a vehicle is disengaged. Immobilisers provide an added defence against thieves who might attempt to ‘hot wire’ your car.  Bonnet locks. Some thieves aren’t after you car; they’re only after certain parts of your car. Criminals who gain access to the inside of your bonnet can help themselves to a number of vital and valuable components, many of which (such as the car battery) can be quickly and easily removed. A bonnet lock is a mechanism that is mounted externally on the car, and basically acts as a deadbolt for your engine compartment. And, in addition to reinforcing your vehicle’s existing latch, it also serves as a visual deterrent, warning thieves away before they choose to commit themselves.  Wheel locks. These are basically civilian versions of the wheel locks used by the police to immobilise suspended vehicles. The lock clamps down securely around the vehicle’s tyre, making it impossible for the car to be moved. Visually, wheel locks function very well, forcing all but the most determined thieves to admit defeat. Unfortunately, wheel locks may be just as much of a hassle for vehicle owners, who will have to take the time to engage and disengage the lock by hand before and after every drive.  Steering-wheel locks. Functioning in much the same way as wheel locks, steering-wheel locks stretch across a car’s steering wheel, securing it in place so that the wheel cannot be turned. The lock is engaged and disengaged with a key, and required a bit less effort to use than the locks that fit around vehicle’s tyres.  Car alarms. Car alarms are probably the most widespread theft deterrent systems, and often come standard in various vehicle models. Alarms do little to actively prevent car theft from taking place, but instead are designed to scare thieves away by calling attention to the theft.  VIN etching. Every legally manufactured car is assigned a unique identification number, which is then displayed on the vehicle interior (such as on the dashboard, or on the inner door frame). This makes it much easier for authorities to track and recover stolen vehicles. However, vehicles that are stolen and then dismantled in order to have their components sold off individually don’t have the same protection. By having your car’s VIN etched into the individual components, you can extend VIN protection to every part of your vehicle.  GPS tracking. Stolen cars that feature GPS trackers are often recovered within hours of the theft. This is because GPS trackers give real-time location updates, which can be relayed to local law enforcement agencies. Some newer vehicles are being manufactured with GPS trackers built in, but for other car’s these devices have to be purchased and installed, and often require the purchase of an on-going service plan from the provider.  Kill switch. Having gained a certain amount of notoriety after being featured on a number of police reality television programs, vehicle kill switches are devices that allow owners to shut down their vehicles remotely, such as in the event of a theft. Once activated, these devices prevent the vehicle in question from being able to operate until it is deactivated by the owner.   Simple preventative measures, such as those outlined may mean the difference between keeping your car, and having it taken from you. Make sure you have a Car insurance policy if the worst does happen.

Other Tracking Stolen Car Tips  Way 1. Use Security Camera Systems to Find Your Stolen Car  When your car is stolen from the dealership, driveway, garage, valet parking, or a mechanic shop, you should check the security camera footage at once. Security camera video recordings are one of the best ways to find your stolen car and vehicle .                      Dual-Band Wireless Security Camera – RLC-410WS  The World’s First Dual-Band WiFi Security Camera (2.4/5 GHz); 1440p; Audio Recording; Built-in SD Card; Installed Outdoors & Indoors.          Learn More    Go to Amazon           One of the most welcomed features of security camera systems is 24/7 continuous recording (the system typically comes with multiple cameras & an NVR or DVR for local storage).  Some standalone security cameras can offer motion detection recording or continuous surveillance (if you keep running the security camera client 24/7). Thus you won’t miss any important events.  If you park your car near your home, your security cameras will record everything happening to your car. Check all of your home security cameras, especially the one in your garage.  Nothing can escape security cameras “detective eyes”. With the car thief’s clear images, and his general escape route, the likelihood of finding your stolen car will significantly increase.  Moreover, you can ask for the permission to check your community’s security camera systems. If your car is stolen in your community, security camera systems will record the trace of your stolen car. A stolen Chevrolet Silverado car owner got his car back by checking a primary school’s security camera systems. All in all, don’t forget this effective way when your car is stolen.   Security cameras are extremely effective on deterring car thieves. You can watch the video below to see how a security camera stops a car theft. If you haven’t installed a security camera for your car and home, it’s time to add one.   Way 2. Call Every Cab Company When Your Car Is Stolen  Cab drivers can help trace your stolen cars, trucks and vehicles. Whatever the situation is, calling all the cab companies in the area where your car is stolen while left running or parking is definitely a good option to find your stolen car.  Taxi drivers seriously outnumber police, thus increasing chances of finding your missing car. Besides, you should give enough reward, such as $100, to the taxi driver who finds your stolen car.  Reward is an incentive to encourage more people to join your stolen vehicle search team, which increases the possibility of recovering your stolen car.  Way 3. Check the City’s Transportation Website for Parking Violation When Your Car Was Stolen  You can track down your stolen car online via checking the parking violation. When your car was stolen, the car thief would park your car somewhere and then abandoned it.  The car was ticketed and put into the parking violation database, which is available online apparently. You can check if your stolen vehicle is in this database and then go to the area where the violation takes place. After that, contact the police immediately, they will search your car and then release it to you if they find it.  Way 4. Check for Your Stolen Car’s Parts Being Sold Online When Your Car Has Been Stolen  You can find your stolen car online if the car thief sells your car on the Internet. If your car has been parted out, finding who is selling those parts could lead you to recover your wheeled baby.  You can use automated checking system, such as Craigslist checker, to track down your stolen vehicle. If you can identify parts from your stolen car, make sure that you contact the police before arranging any meeting with the seller. Car thieves are dangerous guys. Accompanied by the police, you can get your stolen car back more safely and smoothly.  Way 5. Find Your Stolen Car with VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) If Your Car Is Stolen  When your car is stolen, you can locate your stolen vehicle with the VIN. A vehicle identification number (VIN) is a unique code used by vehicle industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, etc. You can track a stolen car online with the vehicle identification number.  VIN not only helps you check if your car is stolen, but also plays an important role on recovering your stolen car. First, go to AutoCheck , and purchase vehicle history report. The cost of the report will be between $30 and $40.  Enter your vehicle identification number and credit card details on the vehicle history report search screen, and you will see a chronological history of the places where your car was registered, titled and serviced.  The last known registration or service should be the most recent location of your stolen vehicle. Thus you can narrow down the search range when your car is stolen, and get your car back fast.  Other Tips You Can Try to Find Your Stolen or Missing Car and Reduce Your Loss  When you car has been stolen, you can also consider the following ways to find your stolen vehicle and reduce your loss.  Tip 1 . Call the police and file a report at once when your car is stolen (especially with your child or baby, dog inside).  When you file a police report, make sure you can provide enough information about your missing car, including the license plate (the police may help you find your stolen car with the license plate), the brand, the place where you last saw your car, and other related details.  The more details you provide, the higher chances that the police can help you retrieve your missing car.  Tip 2 . Use GPS vehicle and car tracking system . Some car owners install GPS car tracking system, like OnStar, LoJack, etc. to secure their cars, especially those expensive cars, such as Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, etc.  If you install this vehicle tracking system, you can know your car location where it got stolen, and then you can trace your hijacked car quickly.  When your car is stolen on test drive, or from dealership while getting repaired, or parking in a shopping mall garage or other places, you can track the stolen vehicle with the GPS.  Tip 3 . Contact your insurance company besides calling the police. Hope you have bought insurance for your car. If your car is lost, your insurance company will compensate for your loss.  Tip 4. Use “Find Stolen Car” app . You can check the helpful apps here to find the missing vehicle with your iPhone or Android smartphone when your car is stolen.  What to do when your car is stolen?

Besides the above effective ways to look for your stolen car, you can get detailed answers below to the hottest “Car Is Stolen” questions, including stolen car insurance, chances of finding stolen vehicles, etc.  #3. “Car Is Stolen” Hottest Questions You May Ask  We make a list of “Car Is Stolen” questions so that you can get all the information you need.  1. Are Stolen Cars Covered by Insurance?  A 1 : If you have comprehensive insurance for your car, you can get compensation from the insurance company. You need to purchase both collision and comprehensive coverage so that you can get compensation if your car is stolen, vandalized or damaged.  2. How Long Does It Take for the Insurance Company to Pay out on Your Stolen Car?  A 2 : If you’ve had the comprehensive insurance for your car, you should file a “car stolen” insurance claim at once. The insurance company will investigate the case before paying out for your loss.  Car insurance companies typically have a waiting period of 30 days, before they will pay a stolen car claim, as it gives time to see if the car would be recovered.  If your car is recovered but comes back damaged, the car insurance company will determine whether the car can be repaired or is a total loss. If your vehicle is considered as a total loss, you’ll get the actual cash value of your car from the company.  If your stolen car reappears after your insurance settlement, your insurance company will retain the ownership of the vehicle. The vehicle would be sold for salvage or at an auction.  You can buy your stolen car back if the laws and the insurance company’s guidelines allow.  3. What Are the Percentage of Stolen Cars Are Covered?  A 3 : According to Progressive Insurance’s report, the US average rate for car theft recovery is 46%, but the rate varies greatly among states. For example, the stolen car recovery rate in Washington was 71%, in Utah was 63%, but only 28% in Alabama.  All in all, the chance of finding stolen car is quite high.

Contact Us  Our Credentials  ALOA Code of Ethics  You are here: Home  /  Resources  / How To Decrease The Odds of Having Your Car Stolen (and how to get it back if it is stolen) How To Decrease The Odds of Having Your Car Stolen (and how to get it back if it is stolen)  August 9, 2014 by Jim · The first and foremost thing to remember is that one should utilize their existing hardware, and look for optimum conditions for parking their car. In other words, ALWAYS lock your doors,  ALWAYS roll up your windows, and always try your best to park in a secure, well lit, and preferably busy area. The efforts you take to prevent car theft from taking place will reap massive returns in overall prevention itself. Thieves are opportunists: If an opportunity does not exist, or requires just a little too much effort to “make the opportunity unfold”, so to speak, then this exponentially decreases chances of vehicle theft. There are too many cars out there, parked in remote areas, with their doors unlocked and keys in the ignition, just begging to be stolen. So simply don’t include your vehicle in that group.  You should always consider supplementing your basic safety efforts, though:   Consider a subscription to a service like On-Star or BMW Assist if your manufacturer offers one . Many of these services have Stolen Vehicle Location and Recovery Assistance and can remotely track and locate your vehicle while communicating with police to help aid in recovery. Get Lojack if your area has Lojack coverage . Lojack is only sold in areas where the police are equipped with Lojack scanners, and does not require a monthly or yearly fee. Chances are if you can buy Lojack in your area, you have coverage. Lojack is a vehicle tracking system that allows police to directly track a stolen vehicle from their police cruisers. This is done directly by the police, without the need of a 3rd party like On-Star to tell them the location.  Get a car security or alarm system with 2 way paging remotes that will notify your remote of your vehicles condition . If the alarm is triggered your remote will alert you of the alarm. Also ECarSecurity offers the Vision Guard 8000 which actually takes a picture from inside the car during the alarm triggering. This picture will quickly be sent to your remote and can help identify a thief.    Consider a 3rd party GPS or GPS/Cellular based tracking system . Most of these have a monthly fee, and will allow to see the location of the vehicle through the companies tracking site or other means. This allows you or them to communicate with the police the location of the stolen vehicle, and some allow you to see the location from your computer as well. This is similar to many fleet-monitoring systems.    Report the theft to police as soon as you find out . The longer a thief has with the car, the longer the thief has to find, remove and disable any OEM or aftermarket tracking system.    Consider going to a watchdog website .    Make sure to etch your VIN in your window . If you have nice aftermarket wheels, stereo equipment, or any other parts you worry about, consider etching your VIN number somewhere inconspicuous (like on the backside or inside lip) of these too. It can make it easier to recover your vehicle and parts. You can ask the dealership for a place that does this.     Tips    On-Star, BMW Assist and other similar manufacturer assistance systems offer many different plans. When purchasing a car, be sure to check if your manufacturer offers such services for their vehicles. To be sure you can effectively use these systems to help attempt recovery of a stolen vehicle, make sure to select a plan that features some sort of Stolen Vehicle Recovery. Most of the monthly or yearly plans will include this, but it never hurts to be sure before you sign up.  Lojack offers an “early Warning system” as well. Consider paying extra for this. This helps inform you quicker of the theft of your vehicle. Through the extra technology, you will be contacted by your chosen method (cell, email, text message, phone call, etc.) the moment the thief drives your car away. This allows you to contact the authorities sooner, increasing chances of recovery.  Some 3rd party GPS tracking systems offer different features than others. Some offer a system with early warning as well. Some can be combined with regular alarm systems to aid in prevention as well as recovery. Understand the way it is set up, and available options and systems thoroughly before purchasing a system, to make sure it’s the right one for you. Remember to pay the monthly fee, your expensive GPS tracking system that requires a monthly fee for the monitoring. Like a cell phone, it won’t be effective if you don’t have a service provider. There are many more types available.  Get a car alarm with 2 way paging remotes for further protection over your vehicle. You can also opt to get a system like the Vision Guard 8000 which will actually take pictures and send it to your remote!  StolenCarReports.com alerts are sent out to people in your area through email and SMS to cell phones. These people will look for your car and call the cops to pick up your ride.  Make sure to etch your VIN in your window. Makes it easier to recover your vehicle.      Warnings    Be careful about etching your car’s VIN number on your window if your car is an older Honda because it easier to steal your car if the thief knows the VIN number.

However new research suggests that once a car is stolen it’s owners stand little chance of ever seeing it again.  If your pride and joy is stolen, chances are you’ll never see it again.  The total number of vehicle thefts fell from 347,000 in 1991 to just 95,681 in 2011, but the proportion of recovered vehicles is on the slide. In 2002, 70 per cent of cars were recovered, with that figure dropping to 51 per cent in 2008. According to the latest numbers from RetainaGroup , that number decreased again in 2011 to a mere 41 per cent.  There are a number of reasons why fewer vehicles are being recovered, chiefly the fact there are now far fewer police officers dedicated to stolen vehicle recovery. According to the Telegraph, the number of police recovery teams has fallen from about 50 two decades ago to just four today, as the force faces budget cuts.  Other reasons, as outlined by Dr Ken German, an ex-member of the New Scotland Yard Stolen Car Squad, include a change in the behaviour of thieves. “Once, when cars were easier to steal, many thefts were by so-called joyriders,” said Dr German. “Vehicles were often stolen for parts, too, as they sometimes are now. Today the big money is in high-value cars for illegal export. Large but unknown numbers are shipped abroad to fund organised crime.”  So it’s clear, then, that your stolen Mercedes or BMW is not in the hands of common thieves but is more likely being packed into a shipping crate destined for Africa, Cyprus, Dubai and the Far East, Pakista, the Middle East, Spain and Eastern Europe, where demand for stolen vehicles is high.  Don’t make the mistake of thinking your high-end car’s security system will keep it safe. Thieves have a number of ways of getting their hands on your pride and joy – with techniques involving everything from stealing the keys from your home to electronically programming a blank key fob to start your engine.  There is some good news to all this, particularly for those of us who own relatively cheap cars. Thieves tend to target expensive luxury vehicles rather than old bangers, so your little runabout stands a great chance of being recovered. Renault, Rover and Fiat are the most likely cars to be found after a theft, with 72.8, 72.7 and 69 per cent recover rates, respectively.

Continue Reading Below Most vehicles are taken because the owners are careless or much too trusting. If you want to avoid losing your set of wheels, start "thinking like a bad guy," advises crime-prevention consultant Art Adkins. Thinking like a thief means looking for crimes of opportunity, explains Adkins, a police lieutenant in Gainesville, Fla. Before you walk away from your parked car, ask yourself: *Is your car an attractive theft target where it&apos;s parked? *How easy have you made it for someone to break in? *Have you bothered to use an anti-theft device? Advertisement Law enforcement agencies and car insurance companies try to educate consumers about the best ways to keep their vehicles safe. "The crime triangle works on three things," says Adkins. "One point is the suspect, one is the victim and one is opportunity. Opportunity is what we have to eliminate." No one method is foolproof, but the more layers of security you create, the greater the chance that a car thief simply will move on to an easier target, says Michelle Staton, executive director of the Pennsylvania Auto Theft Prevention Authority. If you prefer to live dangerously, here are six things guaranteed to put your car at high risk of being stolen. 1. Leave your car doors unlocked This may sound like a no-brainer, but many auto thefts happen when people forget to lock their doors. A locked door is the first line of defense. "About 50% of cars stolen are left unlocked and sometimes have the keys in the ignition," says Staton. Most car thieves won&apos;t bother breaking into a locked car when there are so many unlocked autos to choose from, says Frank Scafidi,  spokesperson for the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). 2. Park your car in dark, deserted areas When it comes to choosing a safe place to park, trust your instincts, Adkins says. Most of us know that dark, isolated spots are more likely to attract car thieves. However, when you&apos;re late for a movie and all the best parking places are taken, it&apos;s easy to ignore the voice within. Adkins urges you to go with your gut reaction. "If you think it is in a bad location, more than likely it is," he says. 3. Don&apos;t use anti-theft devices The more barriers you create to theft, the safer your car will be. Although they are low-tech, old-fashioned and relatively cheap, steering wheel locks remain an effective deterrent. "For a passive thief, a Club can make them go on to the next vehicle," explains Carole Walker, executive director of the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association in Colorado. Some people prefer audible alarms that draw attention to vehicles that are being tampered with. Smart keys with computer chips come standard in some new cars. Another good anti-theft device is an ignition kill switch that prevents thieves from starting your motor. It may sound like closing the barn door after the horses have escaped, but auto-tracking devices are available that can help law enforcement officials find stolen cars using satellite and cell tower technology. Also, anti-theft systems often bring discounts that lower your auto insurance quotes . 4. Drop your guard when you get home Many people take precautions against car theft while traveling, but become complacent when they return to the familiarity of their own neighborhoods. That&apos;s a big mistake, says Sgt. John Delaney, a spokesperson for the Springfield, Mass., Police Department. "A lot of people have the misconception that if it is parked in their driveway it is safe," he says. "They leave the doors open, windows down, keys in the car. It is an open invitation for someone to jump in the car and get going." Always lock your car and use anti-theft devices, even when parked at home. If you have a garage, use it and keep it locked. 5. Assume that your old beater is safe from theft No matter how old and beat up your car is, you can never completely rule out the possibility of theft. "Many times [old cars] are easier to break into," says Walker says. "Many times these models are stolen for parts, because they are easy to sell on the stolen parts market." Staton says parts from a dismantled car may sell for much more than the car could command if sold intact. In some cases, criminals don&apos;t care about the value of the car they&apos;re stealing. They simply need temporary transportation. 6. Leave your motor running When the weather is hot, you may be tempted to leave your vehicle running to keep the air conditioning powered while you dash into a bank or convenience store. In such cases, you may end up paying a big price for trying to keep cool. It only takes seconds for an observant thief to jump inside your unattended car. In cold weather, thieves also target cars that have been left running in driveways to warm up. Your valuables are a neon sign After you&apos;ve taken steps to avoid auto theft, make sure you&apos;ve done nothing to encourage someone to burglarize your vehicle. Adkins says many people foolishly leave money, GPS devices and packages from high-end retail stores visible in their cars. For a thief, that&apos;s an invitation that&apos;s hard to resist. "Those are like neon signs," warns Adkins. "When you walk into a store, you are looking for a sale. That is how the bad guys shop. They are looking for visual cues." Take the time to put valuables out of sight in your car&apos;s trunk, he advises. If you have a minivan or SUV that lacks a secure trunk, cover valuable items with a blanket. Insuring against auto theft When you shop for car insurance rates , remember that you need to buy comprehensive auto insurance in order to be covered in case your vehicle is stolen, vandalized, burned or damaged by weather. Check out the most stolen cars in 2010 . Your home insurance covers the loss if your possessions are stolen from your car. But in both cases the claim payment will be reduced by the amount of your deductible.
