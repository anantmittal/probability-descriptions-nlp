Expand all  |  Collapse all      What is infertility?   Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after one year of trying (or six months if a woman is 35 or older). Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile.  Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps. To get pregnant:   A woman's body must release an egg from one of her ovaries (ovulation).  The egg must go through a fallopian tube toward the uterus (womb).  A man's sperm must join with (fertilize) the egg along the way.  The fertilized egg must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation).   Infertility can happen if there are problems with any of these steps.     Is infertility a common problem?   Yes. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).     Is infertility just a woman's problem?   No, infertility is not always a woman's problem. Both women and men can have problems that cause infertility. About one-third of infertility cases are caused by women's problems. Another one third of fertility problems are due to the man. The other cases are caused by a mixture of male and female problems or by unknown problems.     What causes infertility in men?   Infertility in men is most often caused by:   A problem called varicocele (VAIR-ih-koh-seel). This happens when the veins on a man's testicle(s) are too large. This heats the testicles. The heat can affect the number or shape of the sperm.  Other factors that cause a man to make too few sperm or none at all.  Movement of the sperm. This may be caused by the shape of the sperm. Sometimes injuries or other damage to the reproductive system block the sperm.   Sometimes a man is born with the problems that affect his sperm. Other times problems start later in life due to illness or injury. For example, cystic fibrosis often causes infertility in men.     What increases a man's risk of infertility?   A man's sperm can be changed by his overall health and lifestyle. Some things that may reduce the health or number of sperm include:   Heavy alcohol use  Drugs  Smoking cigarettes  Age  Environmental toxins, including pesticides and lead  Health problems such as mumps, serious conditions like kidney disease, or hormone problems  Medicines  Radiation treatment and chemotherapy for cancer      What causes infertility in women?   Most cases of female infertility are caused by problems with ovulation. Without ovulation, there are no eggs to be fertilized. Some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods.  Ovulation problems are often caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormone imbalance problem which can interfere with normal ovulation. PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is another cause of ovulation problems. POI occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. POI is not the same as early menopause.  Less common causes of fertility problems in women include:   Blocked fallopian tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease , endometriosis , or surgery for an ectopic pregnancy  Physical problems with the uterus  Uterine fibroids , which are non-cancerous clumps of tissue and muscle on the walls of the uterus.      What things increase a woman's risk of infertility?   Many things can change a woman's ability to have a baby. These include:   Age  Smoking  Excess alcohol use  Stress  Poor diet  Athletic training  Being overweight or underweight  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  Health problems that cause hormonal changes, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and primary ovarian insufficiency      How does age affect a woman's ability to have children?   Many women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 20 percent of women in the United States now have their first child after age 35. So age is a growing cause of fertility problems. About one-third of couples in which the woman is over 35 have fertility problems.  Aging decreases a woman's chances of having a baby in the following ways:   Her ovaries become less able to release eggs  She has a smaller number of eggs left  Her eggs are not as healthy  She is more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems  She is more likely to have a miscarriage      How long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors?   Most experts suggest at least one year. Women 35 or older should see their doctors after six months of trying. A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.  Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, women should talk to their doctors if they have:   Irregular periods or no menstrual periods  Very painful periods  Endometriosis  Pelvic inflammatory disease  More than one miscarriage   It is a good idea for any woman to talk to a doctor before trying to get pregnant. Doctors can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving.     How will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?   Doctors will do an infertility checkup. This involves a physical exam. The doctor will also ask for both partners' health and sexual histories. Sometimes this can find the problem. However, most of the time, the doctor will need to do more tests.  In men, doctors usually begin by testing the semen. They look at the number, shape, and movement of the sperm. Sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones.  In women, the first step is to find out if she is ovulating each month. There are a few ways to do this. A woman can track her ovulation at home by:   Writing down changes in her morning body temperature for several months  Writing down how her cervical mucus looks for several months  Using a home ovulation test kit (available at drug or grocery stores)   Doctors can also check ovulation with blood tests. Or they can do an ultrasound of the ovaries. If ovulation is normal, there are other fertility tests available.  Some common tests of fertility in women include:   Hysterosalpingography (HIS-tur-oh-sal-ping-GOGH-ru-fee): This is an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Doctors inject a special dye into the uterus through the vagina. This dye shows up in the x-ray. Doctors can then watch to see if the dye moves freely through the uterus and fallopian tubes. This can help them find physical blocks that may be causing infertility. Blocks in the system can keep the egg from moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. A block could also keep the sperm from reaching the egg.  Laparoscopy (lap-uh-ROS-kuh-pee): A minor surgery to see inside the abdomen. The doctor does this with a small tool with a light called a laparoscope (LAP-uh-roh-skohp). She or he makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. With the laparoscope, the doctor can check the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus for disease and physical problems. Doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.   Finding the cause of infertility can be a long and emotional process. It may take time to complete all the needed tests. So don't worry if the problem is not found right away.     How do doctors treat infertility?   Infertility can be treated with medicine , surgery, artificial insemination , or assisted reproductive technology . Many times these treatments are combined. In most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery.  Doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility based on:   Test results  How long the couple has been trying to get pregnant  The age of both the man and woman  The overall health of the partners  Preference of the partners   Doctors often treat  infertility in men in the following ways:   Sexual problems: Doctors can help men deal with impotence or premature ejaculation. Behavioral therapy and/or medicines can be used in these cases.  Too few sperm: Sometimes surgery can correct the cause of the problem. In other cases, doctors surgically remove sperm directly from the male reproductive tract. Antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count.  Sperm movement: Sometimes semen has no sperm because of a block in the man's system. In some cases, surgery can correct the problem.   In women, some physical problems can also be corrected with surgery.  A number of fertility medicines are used to treat women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. You should understand the possible dangers, benefits, and side effects.     What medicines are used to treat infertility in women?   Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include:   Clomiphene citrate ( Clomid ): This medicine causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. It is often used in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other problems with ovulation. This medicine is taken by mouth.  Human menopausal gonadotropin or hMG ( Repronex, Pergonal ): This medicine is often used for women who don't ovulate due to problems with their pituitary gland. hMG acts directly on the ovaries to stimulate ovulation. It is an injected medicine.  Follicle-stimulating hormone or FSH ( Gonal-F, Follistim ): FSH works much like hMG. It causes the ovaries to begin the process of ovulation. These medicines are usually injected.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analog: These medicines are often used for women who don't ovulate regularly each month. Women who ovulate before the egg is ready can also use these medicines. Gn-RH analogs act on the pituitary gland to change when the body ovulates. These medicines are usually injected or given with a nasal spray.  Metformin ( Glucophage ): Doctors use this medicine for women who have insulin resistance and/or PCOS. This drug helps lower the high levels of male hormones in women with these conditions. This helps the body to ovulate. Sometimes clomiphene citrate or FSH is combined with metformin. This medicine is usually taken by mouth.  Bromocriptine ( Parlodel ): This medicine is used for women with ovulation problems due to high levels of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that causes milk production.   Many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born too early (prematurely). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.     What is intrauterine insemination (IUI)?   Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is often called artificial insemination. In this procedure, the woman is injected with specially prepared sperm. Sometimes the woman is also treated with medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.  IUI is often used to treat:   Mild male factor infertility  Women who have problems with their cervical mucus  Couples with unexplained infertility      What is assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a group of different methods used to help infertile couples. ART works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body.     How often is assisted reproductive technology (ART) successful?   Success rates vary and depend on many factors. Some things that affect the success rate of ART include:   Age of the partners  Reason for infertility  Clinic  Type of ART  If the egg is fresh or frozen  If the embryo is fresh or frozen   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to a 2014 CDC report on ART , the average percentage of ART cycles that led to a live birth were:   39 percent in women under the age of 35  30 percent in women aged 35-37  21 percent in women aged 37-40  11 percent in women aged 41-42   ART can be expensive and time-consuming. But it has allowed many couples to have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common complication of ART is multiple fetuses. But this is a problem that can be prevented or minimized in several different ways.     What are the different types of assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Common methods of ART include:   In vitro fertilization (IVF) means fertilization outside of the body. IVF is the most effective ART. It is often used when a woman's fallopian tubes are blocked or when a man produces too few sperm. Doctors treat the woman with a drug that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Once mature, the eggs are removed from the woman. They are put in a dish in the lab along with the man's sperm for fertilization. After 3 to 5 days, healthy embryos are implanted in the woman's uterus.  Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or Tubal Embryo Transfer is similar to IVF. Fertilization occurs in the laboratory. Then the very young embryo is transferred to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus.  Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) involves transferring eggs and sperm into the woman's fallopian tube. So fertilization occurs in the woman's body. Few practices offer GIFT as an option.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is often used for couples in which there are serious problems with the sperm. Sometimes it is also used for older couples or for those with failed IVF attempts. In ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg. Then the embryo is transferred to the uterus or fallopian tube.   ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who can not produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm is sometimes used when the woman or man has a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby. An infertile woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either parent.  Surrogacy  Women with no eggs or unhealthy eggs might also want to consider surrogacy. A surrogate is a woman who agrees to become pregnant using the man's sperm and her own egg. The child will be genetically related to the surrogate and the male partner. After birth, the surrogate will give up the baby for adoption by the parents.  Gestational carrier  Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. This may also be an option for women who shouldn't become pregnant because of a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is fertilized by the man's sperm and the embryo is placed inside the carrier's uterus. The carrier will not be related to the baby and gives him or her to the parents at birth.  Recent research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that ART babies are two to four times more likely to have certain kinds of birth defects. These may include heart and digestive system problems, and cleft (divided into two pieces) lips or palate. Researchers don't know why this happens. The birth defects may not be due to the technology. Other factors, like the age of the parents, may be involved. More research is needed. The risk is relatively low, but parents should consider this when making the decision to use ART.

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is another cause of ovulation problems. POI occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. POI is not the same as early menopause.  Less common causes of fertility problems in women include:   Blocked fallopian tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease , endometriosis , or surgery for an ectopic pregnancy  Physical problems with the uterus  Uterine fibroids , which are non-cancerous clumps of tissue and muscle on the walls of the uterus.      What things increase a woman's risk of infertility?   Many things can change a woman's ability to have a baby. These include:   Age  Smoking  Excess alcohol use  Stress  Poor diet  Athletic training  Being overweight or underweight  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  Health problems that cause hormonal changes, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and primary ovarian insufficiency      How does age affect a woman's ability to have children?   Many women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 20 percent of women in the United States now have their first child after age 35. So age is a growing cause of fertility problems. About one-third of couples in which the woman is over 35 have fertility problems.  Aging decreases a woman's chances of having a baby in the following ways:   Her ovaries become less able to release eggs  She has a smaller number of eggs left  Her eggs are not as healthy  She is more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems  She is more likely to have a miscarriage      How long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors?   Most experts suggest at least one year. Women 35 or older should see their doctors after six months of trying. A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.  Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, women should talk to their doctors if they have:   Irregular periods or no menstrual periods  Very painful periods  Endometriosis  Pelvic inflammatory disease  More than one miscarriage   It is a good idea for any woman to talk to a doctor before trying to get pregnant. Doctors can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving.     How will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?   Doctors will do an infertility checkup. This involves a physical exam. The doctor will also ask for both partners' health and sexual histories. Sometimes this can find the problem. However, most of the time, the doctor will need to do more tests.  In men, doctors usually begin by testing the semen. They look at the number, shape, and movement of the sperm. Sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones.  In women, the first step is to find out if she is ovulating each month. There are a few ways to do this. A woman can track her ovulation at home by:   Writing down changes in her morning body temperature for several months  Writing down how her cervical mucus looks for several months  Using a home ovulation test kit (available at drug or grocery stores)   Doctors can also check ovulation with blood tests. Or they can do an ultrasound of the ovaries. If ovulation is normal, there are other fertility tests available.  Some common tests of fertility in women include:   Hysterosalpingography (HIS-tur-oh-sal-ping-GOGH-ru-fee): This is an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Doctors inject a special dye into the uterus through the vagina. This dye shows up in the x-ray. Doctors can then watch to see if the dye moves freely through the uterus and fallopian tubes. This can help them find physical blocks that may be causing infertility. Blocks in the system can keep the egg from moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. A block could also keep the sperm from reaching the egg.  Laparoscopy (lap-uh-ROS-kuh-pee): A minor surgery to see inside the abdomen. The doctor does this with a small tool with a light called a laparoscope (LAP-uh-roh-skohp). She or he makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. With the laparoscope, the doctor can check the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus for disease and physical problems. Doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.   Finding the cause of infertility can be a long and emotional process. It may take time to complete all the needed tests. So don't worry if the problem is not found right away.     How do doctors treat infertility?   Infertility can be treated with medicine , surgery, artificial insemination , or assisted reproductive technology . Many times these treatments are combined. In most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery.  Doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility based on:   Test results  How long the couple has been trying to get pregnant  The age of both the man and woman  The overall health of the partners  Preference of the partners   Doctors often treat  infertility in men in the following ways:   Sexual problems: Doctors can help men deal with impotence or premature ejaculation. Behavioral therapy and/or medicines can be used in these cases.  Too few sperm: Sometimes surgery can correct the cause of the problem. In other cases, doctors surgically remove sperm directly from the male reproductive tract. Antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count.  Sperm movement: Sometimes semen has no sperm because of a block in the man's system. In some cases, surgery can correct the problem.   In women, some physical problems can also be corrected with surgery.  A number of fertility medicines are used to treat women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. You should understand the possible dangers, benefits, and side effects.     What medicines are used to treat infertility in women?   Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include:   Clomiphene citrate ( Clomid ): This medicine causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. It is often used in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other problems with ovulation. This medicine is taken by mouth.  Human menopausal gonadotropin or hMG ( Repronex, Pergonal ): This medicine is often used for women who don't ovulate due to problems with their pituitary gland. hMG acts directly on the ovaries to stimulate ovulation. It is an injected medicine.  Follicle-stimulating hormone or FSH ( Gonal-F, Follistim ): FSH works much like hMG. It causes the ovaries to begin the process of ovulation. These medicines are usually injected.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analog: These medicines are often used for women who don't ovulate regularly each month. Women who ovulate before the egg is ready can also use these medicines. Gn-RH analogs act on the pituitary gland to change when the body ovulates. These medicines are usually injected or given with a nasal spray.  Metformin ( Glucophage ): Doctors use this medicine for women who have insulin resistance and/or PCOS. This drug helps lower the high levels of male hormones in women with these conditions. This helps the body to ovulate. Sometimes clomiphene citrate or FSH is combined with metformin. This medicine is usually taken by mouth.  Bromocriptine ( Parlodel ): This medicine is used for women with ovulation problems due to high levels of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that causes milk production.   Many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born too early (prematurely). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.     What is intrauterine insemination (IUI)?   Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is often called artificial insemination. In this procedure, the woman is injected with specially prepared sperm. Sometimes the woman is also treated with medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.  IUI is often used to treat:   Mild male factor infertility  Women who have problems with their cervical mucus  Couples with unexplained infertility      What is assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a group of different methods used to help infertile couples. ART works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body.     How often is assisted reproductive technology (ART) successful?   Success rates vary and depend on many factors. Some things that affect the success rate of ART include:   Age of the partners  Reason for infertility  Clinic  Type of ART  If the egg is fresh or frozen  If the embryo is fresh or frozen   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to a 2014 CDC report on ART , the average percentage of ART cycles that led to a live birth were:   39 percent in women under the age of 35  30 percent in women aged 35-37  21 percent in women aged 37-40  11 percent in women aged 41-42   ART can be expensive and time-consuming. But it has allowed many couples to have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common complication of ART is multiple fetuses. But this is a problem that can be prevented or minimized in several different ways.     What are the different types of assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Common methods of ART include:   In vitro fertilization (IVF) means fertilization outside of the body. IVF is the most effective ART. It is often used when a woman's fallopian tubes are blocked or when a man produces too few sperm. Doctors treat the woman with a drug that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Once mature, the eggs are removed from the woman. They are put in a dish in the lab along with the man's sperm for fertilization. After 3 to 5 days, healthy embryos are implanted in the woman's uterus.  Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or Tubal Embryo Transfer is similar to IVF. Fertilization occurs in the laboratory. Then the very young embryo is transferred to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus.  Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) involves transferring eggs and sperm into the woman's fallopian tube. So fertilization occurs in the woman's body. Few practices offer GIFT as an option.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is often used for couples in which there are serious problems with the sperm. Sometimes it is also used for older couples or for those with failed IVF attempts. In ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg. Then the embryo is transferred to the uterus or fallopian tube.   ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who can not produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm is sometimes used when the woman or man has a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby. An infertile woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either parent.  Surrogacy  Women with no eggs or unhealthy eggs might also want to consider surrogacy. A surrogate is a woman who agrees to become pregnant using the man's sperm and her own egg. The child will be genetically related to the surrogate and the male partner. After birth, the surrogate will give up the baby for adoption by the parents.  Gestational carrier  Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. This may also be an option for women who shouldn't become pregnant because of a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is fertilized by the man's sperm and the embryo is placed inside the carrier's uterus. The carrier will not be related to the baby and gives him or her to the parents at birth.  Recent research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that ART babies are two to four times more likely to have certain kinds of birth defects. These may include heart and digestive system problems, and cleft (divided into two pieces) lips or palate. Researchers don't know why this happens. The birth defects may not be due to the technology. Other factors, like the age of the parents, may be involved. More research is needed. The risk is relatively low, but parents should consider this when making the decision to use ART.

Female infertility, male infertility or a combination of the two affects millions of couples in the United States. An estimated 10 to 18 percent of couples have trouble getting pregnant or having a successful delivery.  Infertility results from female factors about one-third of the time and male factors about one-third of the time. The cause is either unknown or a combination of male and female factors in the remaining cases.  Female infertility causes can be difficult to diagnose. There are many available treatments, which will depend on the cause of infertility. Many infertile couples will go on to conceive a child without treatment. After trying to get pregnant for two years, about 95 percent of couples successfully conceive.      Symptoms The main symptom of infertility is the inability to get pregnant. A menstrual cycle that's too long (35 days or more), too short (less than 21 days), irregular or absent can mean that you're not ovulating. There may be no other outward signs or symptoms.  When to see a doctor  When to seek help sometimes depends on your age:   Up to age 35, most doctors recommend trying to get pregnant for at least a year before testing or treatment.  If you're between 35 and 40, discuss your concerns with your doctor after six months of trying.  If you're older than 40, your doctor may want to begin testing or treatment right away.   Your doctor may also want to begin testing or treatment right away if you or your partner has known fertility problems, or if you have a history of irregular or painful periods, pelvic inflammatory disease, repeated miscarriages, prior cancer treatment, or endometriosis.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes    Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.        Fertilization and implantation Fertilization and implantation During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote. Then the zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula. Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst. The blastocyst then burrows into the uterine lining — a process called implantation.     Each of these factors is essential to become pregnant:   You need to ovulate. To get pregnant, your ovaries must produce and release an egg, a process known as ovulation. Your doctor can help evaluate your menstrual cycles and confirm ovulation.  Your partner needs sperm. For most couples, this isn't a problem unless your partner has a history of illness or surgery. Your doctor can run some simple tests to evaluate the health of your partner's sperm.  You need to have regular intercourse. You need to have regular sexual intercourse during your fertile time. Your doctor can help you better understand when you're most fertile.  You need to have open fallopian tubes and a normal uterus. The egg and sperm meet in the fallopian tubes, and the embryo needs a healthy uterus in which to grow.   For pregnancy to occur, every step of the human reproduction process has to happen correctly. The steps in this process are:   One of the two ovaries releases a mature egg.  The egg is picked up by the fallopian tube.  Sperm swim up the cervix, through the uterus and into the fallopian tube to reach the egg for fertilization.  The fertilized egg travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus.  The fertilized egg implants and grows in the uterus.   In women, a number of factors can disrupt this process at any step. Female infertility is caused by one or more of the factors below.            Transcript Ovulation is the release of an egg from one of the ovaries. It often happens about midway through the menstrual cycle, although the exact timing may vary.  In preparation for ovulation, the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, thickens.  The pituitary gland in the brain stimulates one of the ovaries to release an egg.  The wall of the ovarian follicle ruptures at the surface of the ovary. The egg is released.  Finger-like structures called fimbriae sweep the egg into the neighboring fallopian tube.  The egg travels through the fallopian tube, propelled in part by contractions in the fallopian tube walls.  Here in the fallopian tube, the egg may be fertilized by a sperm.  If the egg is fertilized, the egg and sperm unite to form a one-celled entity called a zygote.  As the zygote travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, it begins dividing rapidly to form a cluster of cells resembling a tiny raspberry.  When the zygote reaches the uterus, it implants in the lining of the uterus and pregnancy begins.  If the egg isn't fertilized, it's simply reabsorbed by the body — perhaps before it even reaches the uterus. About two weeks later, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina. This is known as menstruation.    Ovulation disorders  Ovulation disorders, meaning you ovulate infrequently or not at all, account for infertility in about 1 in 4 infertile couples. Problems with the regulation of reproductive hormones by the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, or problems in the ovary, can cause ovulation disorders.   Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ).  PCOS causes a hormone imbalance, which affects ovulation. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and obesity, abnormal hair growth on the face or body, and acne. It's the most common cause of female infertility.  Hypothalamic dysfunction. Two hormones produced by the pituitary gland are responsible for stimulating ovulation each month — ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ). Excess physical or emotional stress, a very high or very low body weight, or a recent substantial weight gain or loss can disrupt production of these hormones and affect ovulation. Irregular or absent periods are the most common signs.  Premature ovarian failure. Also called primary ovarian insufficiency, this disorder is usually caused by an autoimmune response or by premature loss of eggs from your ovary (possibly from genetics or chemotherapy). The ovary no longer produces eggs, and it lowers estrogen production in women under the age of 40.  Too much prolactin. The pituitary gland may cause excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia), which reduces estrogen production and may cause infertility. Usually related to a pituitary gland problem, this can also be caused by medications you're taking for another disease.   Damage to fallopian tubes (tubal infertility)  Damaged or blocked fallopian tubes keep sperm from getting to the egg or block the passage of the fertilized egg into the uterus. Causes of fallopian tube damage or blockage can include:   Pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes due to chlamydia, gonorrhea or other sexually transmitted infections  Previous surgery in the abdomen or pelvis, including surgery for ectopic pregnancy, in which a fertilized egg implants and develops in a fallopian tube instead of the uterus  Pelvic tuberculosis, a major cause of tubal infertility worldwide, although uncommon in the United States   Endometriosis  Endometriosis occurs when tissue that normally grows in the uterus implants and grows in other locations. This extra tissue growth — and the surgical removal of it — can cause scarring, which may block fallopian tubes and keep an egg and sperm from uniting.  Endometriosis can also affect the lining of the uterus, disrupting implantation of the fertilized egg. The condition also seems to affect fertility in less-direct ways, such as damage to the sperm or egg.  Uterine or cervical causes  Several uterine or cervical causes can impact fertility by interfering with implantation or increasing the likelihood of a miscarriage:   Benign polyps or tumors (fibroids or myomas) are common in the uterus. Some can block fallopian tubes or interfere with implantation, affecting fertility. However, many women who have fibroids or polyps do become pregnant.  Endometriosis scarring or inflammation within the uterus can disrupt implantation.  Uterine abnormalities present from birth, such as an abnormally shaped uterus, can cause problems becoming or remaining pregnant.  Cervical stenosis, a narrowing of the cervix, can be caused by an inherited malformation or damage to the cervix.  Sometimes the cervix can't produce the best type of mucus to allow the sperm to travel through the cervix into the uterus.   Unexplained infertility  Sometimes, the cause of infertility is never found. A combination of several minor factors in both partners could cause unexplained fertility problems. Although it's frustrating to get no specific answer, this problem may correct itself with time. But, you shouldn't delay treatment for infertility.  Risk factors Certain factors may put you at higher risk of infertility, including:   Age. The quality and quantity of a woman's eggs begin to decline with increasing age. In the mid-30s, the rate of follicle loss speeds, resulting in fewer and poorer quality eggs. This makes conception more difficult, and increases the risk of miscarriage.  Smoking. Besides damaging your cervix and fallopian tubes, smoking increases your risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. It's also thought to age your ovaries and deplete your eggs prematurely. Stop smoking before beginning fertility treatment.  Weight. Being overweight or significantly underweight may affect normal ovulation. Getting to a healthy body mass index ( BMI ) may increase the frequency of ovulation and likelihood of pregnancy.  Sexual history. Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can damage the fallopian tubes. Having unprotected intercourse with multiple partners increases your risk of a sexually transmitted infection that may cause fertility problems later.  Alcohol. Stick to moderate alcohol consumption of no more than one alcoholic drink per day.   Prevention If you're a woman thinking about getting pregnant soon or in the future, you may improve your chances of having normal fertility if you:   Maintain a normal weight. Overweight and underweight women are at increased risk of ovulation disorders. If you need to lose weight, exercise moderately. Strenuous, intense exercise of more than five hours a week has been associated with decreased ovulation.  Quit smoking. Tobacco has multiple negative effects on fertility, not to mention your general health and the health of a fetus. If you smoke and are considering pregnancy, quit now.  Avoid alcohol. Heavy alcohol use may lead to decreased fertility. And any alcohol use can affect the health of a developing fetus. If you're planning to become pregnant, avoid alcohol, and don't drink alcohol while you're pregnant.  Reduce stress. Some studies have shown that couples experiencing psychological stress had poorer results with infertility treatment. If you can, find a way to reduce stress in your life before trying to become pregnant.  Limit caffeine. Research suggests that limiting caffeine intake to less than 200 milligrams a day shouldn't affect your ability to get pregnant. That's about one to two cups of 6 to 8 ounces of coffee per day.

Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).          Expand all  |  Collapse all      What is infertility?   Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after one year of trying (or six months if a woman is 35 or older). Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile.  Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps. To get pregnant:   A woman's body must release an egg from one of her ovaries (ovulation).  The egg must go through a fallopian tube toward the uterus (womb).  A man's sperm must join with (fertilize) the egg along the way.  The fertilized egg must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation).   Infertility can happen if there are problems with any of these steps.     Is infertility a common problem?   Yes. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).     Is infertility just a woman's problem?   No, infertility is not always a woman's problem. Both women and men can have problems that cause infertility. About one-third of infertility cases are caused by women's problems. Another one third of fertility problems are due to the man. The other cases are caused by a mixture of male and female problems or by unknown problems.     What causes infertility in men?   Infertility in men is most often caused by:   A problem called varicocele (VAIR-ih-koh-seel). This happens when the veins on a man's testicle(s) are too large. This heats the testicles. The heat can affect the number or shape of the sperm.  Other factors that cause a man to make too few sperm or none at all.  Movement of the sperm. This may be caused by the shape of the sperm. Sometimes injuries or other damage to the reproductive system block the sperm.   Sometimes a man is born with the problems that affect his sperm. Other times problems start later in life due to illness or injury. For example, cystic fibrosis often causes infertility in men.     What increases a man's risk of infertility?   A man's sperm can be changed by his overall health and lifestyle. Some things that may reduce the health or number of sperm include:   Heavy alcohol use  Drugs  Smoking cigarettes  Age  Environmental toxins, including pesticides and lead  Health problems such as mumps, serious conditions like kidney disease, or hormone problems  Medicines  Radiation treatment and chemotherapy for cancer      What causes infertility in women?   Most cases of female infertility are caused by problems with ovulation. Without ovulation, there are no eggs to be fertilized. Some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods.  Ovulation problems are often caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormone imbalance problem which can interfere with normal ovulation. PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is another cause of ovulation problems. POI occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. POI is not the same as early menopause.  Less common causes of fertility problems in women include:   Blocked fallopian tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease , endometriosis , or surgery for an ectopic pregnancy  Physical problems with the uterus  Uterine fibroids , which are non-cancerous clumps of tissue and muscle on the walls of the uterus.      What things increase a woman's risk of infertility?   Many things can change a woman's ability to have a baby. These include:   Age  Smoking  Excess alcohol use  Stress  Poor diet  Athletic training  Being overweight or underweight  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  Health problems that cause hormonal changes, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and primary ovarian insufficiency      How does age affect a woman's ability to have children?   Many women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 20 percent of women in the United States now have their first child after age 35. So age is a growing cause of fertility problems. About one-third of couples in which the woman is over 35 have fertility problems.  Aging decreases a woman's chances of having a baby in the following ways:   Her ovaries become less able to release eggs  She has a smaller number of eggs left  Her eggs are not as healthy  She is more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems  She is more likely to have a miscarriage      How long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors?   Most experts suggest at least one year. Women 35 or older should see their doctors after six months of trying. A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.  Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, women should talk to their doctors if they have:   Irregular periods or no menstrual periods  Very painful periods  Endometriosis  Pelvic inflammatory disease  More than one miscarriage   It is a good idea for any woman to talk to a doctor before trying to get pregnant. Doctors can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving.     How will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?   Doctors will do an infertility checkup. This involves a physical exam. The doctor will also ask for both partners' health and sexual histories. Sometimes this can find the problem. However, most of the time, the doctor will need to do more tests.  In men, doctors usually begin by testing the semen. They look at the number, shape, and movement of the sperm. Sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones.  In women, the first step is to find out if she is ovulating each month. There are a few ways to do this. A woman can track her ovulation at home by:   Writing down changes in her morning body temperature for several months  Writing down how her cervical mucus looks for several months  Using a home ovulation test kit (available at drug or grocery stores)   Doctors can also check ovulation with blood tests. Or they can do an ultrasound of the ovaries. If ovulation is normal, there are other fertility tests available.  Some common tests of fertility in women include:   Hysterosalpingography (HIS-tur-oh-sal-ping-GOGH-ru-fee): This is an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Doctors inject a special dye into the uterus through the vagina. This dye shows up in the x-ray. Doctors can then watch to see if the dye moves freely through the uterus and fallopian tubes. This can help them find physical blocks that may be causing infertility. Blocks in the system can keep the egg from moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. A block could also keep the sperm from reaching the egg.  Laparoscopy (lap-uh-ROS-kuh-pee): A minor surgery to see inside the abdomen. The doctor does this with a small tool with a light called a laparoscope (LAP-uh-roh-skohp). She or he makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. With the laparoscope, the doctor can check the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus for disease and physical problems. Doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.   Finding the cause of infertility can be a long and emotional process. It may take time to complete all the needed tests. So don't worry if the problem is not found right away.     How do doctors treat infertility?   Infertility can be treated with medicine , surgery, artificial insemination , or assisted reproductive technology . Many times these treatments are combined. In most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery.  Doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility based on:   Test results  How long the couple has been trying to get pregnant  The age of both the man and woman  The overall health of the partners  Preference of the partners   Doctors often treat  infertility in men in the following ways:   Sexual problems: Doctors can help men deal with impotence or premature ejaculation. Behavioral therapy and/or medicines can be used in these cases.  Too few sperm: Sometimes surgery can correct the cause of the problem. In other cases, doctors surgically remove sperm directly from the male reproductive tract. Antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count.  Sperm movement: Sometimes semen has no sperm because of a block in the man's system. In some cases, surgery can correct the problem.   In women, some physical problems can also be corrected with surgery.  A number of fertility medicines are used to treat women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. You should understand the possible dangers, benefits, and side effects.     What medicines are used to treat infertility in women?   Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include:   Clomiphene citrate ( Clomid ): This medicine causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. It is often used in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other problems with ovulation. This medicine is taken by mouth.  Human menopausal gonadotropin or hMG ( Repronex, Pergonal ): This medicine is often used for women who don't ovulate due to problems with their pituitary gland. hMG acts directly on the ovaries to stimulate ovulation. It is an injected medicine.  Follicle-stimulating hormone or FSH ( Gonal-F, Follistim ): FSH works much like hMG. It causes the ovaries to begin the process of ovulation. These medicines are usually injected.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analog: These medicines are often used for women who don't ovulate regularly each month. Women who ovulate before the egg is ready can also use these medicines. Gn-RH analogs act on the pituitary gland to change when the body ovulates. These medicines are usually injected or given with a nasal spray.  Metformin ( Glucophage ): Doctors use this medicine for women who have insulin resistance and/or PCOS. This drug helps lower the high levels of male hormones in women with these conditions. This helps the body to ovulate. Sometimes clomiphene citrate or FSH is combined with metformin. This medicine is usually taken by mouth.  Bromocriptine ( Parlodel ): This medicine is used for women with ovulation problems due to high levels of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that causes milk production.   Many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born too early (prematurely). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.     What is intrauterine insemination (IUI)?   Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is often called artificial insemination. In this procedure, the woman is injected with specially prepared sperm. Sometimes the woman is also treated with medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.  IUI is often used to treat:   Mild male factor infertility  Women who have problems with their cervical mucus  Couples with unexplained infertility      What is assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a group of different methods used to help infertile couples. ART works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body.     How often is assisted reproductive technology (ART) successful?   Success rates vary and depend on many factors. Some things that affect the success rate of ART include:   Age of the partners  Reason for infertility  Clinic  Type of ART  If the egg is fresh or frozen  If the embryo is fresh or frozen   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to a 2014 CDC report on ART , the average percentage of ART cycles that led to a live birth were:   39 percent in women under the age of 35  30 percent in women aged 35-37  21 percent in women aged 37-40  11 percent in women aged 41-42   ART can be expensive and time-consuming. But it has allowed many couples to have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common complication of ART is multiple fetuses. But this is a problem that can be prevented or minimized in several different ways.     What are the different types of assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Common methods of ART include:   In vitro fertilization (IVF) means fertilization outside of the body. IVF is the most effective ART. It is often used when a woman's fallopian tubes are blocked or when a man produces too few sperm. Doctors treat the woman with a drug that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Once mature, the eggs are removed from the woman. They are put in a dish in the lab along with the man's sperm for fertilization. After 3 to 5 days, healthy embryos are implanted in the woman's uterus.  Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or Tubal Embryo Transfer is similar to IVF. Fertilization occurs in the laboratory. Then the very young embryo is transferred to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus.  Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) involves transferring eggs and sperm into the woman's fallopian tube. So fertilization occurs in the woman's body. Few practices offer GIFT as an option.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is often used for couples in which there are serious problems with the sperm. Sometimes it is also used for older couples or for those with failed IVF attempts. In ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg. Then the embryo is transferred to the uterus or fallopian tube.   ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who can not produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm is sometimes used when the woman or man has a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby. An infertile woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either parent.  Surrogacy  Women with no eggs or unhealthy eggs might also want to consider surrogacy. A surrogate is a woman who agrees to become pregnant using the man's sperm and her own egg. The child will be genetically related to the surrogate and the male partner. After birth, the surrogate will give up the baby for adoption by the parents.  Gestational carrier  Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. This may also be an option for women who shouldn't become pregnant because of a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is fertilized by the man's sperm and the embryo is placed inside the carrier's uterus. The carrier will not be related to the baby and gives him or her to the parents at birth.  Recent research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that ART babies are two to four times more likely to have certain kinds of birth defects. These may include heart and digestive system problems, and cleft (divided into two pieces) lips or palate. Researchers don't know why this happens. The birth defects may not be due to the technology. Other factors, like the age of the parents, may be involved. More research is needed. The risk is relatively low, but parents should consider this when making the decision to use ART.

About one-third of these cases are due to female fertility problems, one-third to male fertility problems, and the rest to factors involving both partners or to unexplained causes. If you've had regular, unprotected sex for more than a year without conceiving (or six months if you're older than 35), see your doctor . About 65 percent of couples that get treatment for a fertility problem are eventually able to have a successful pregnancy, according to Resolve, the national infertility association. The success rates below are based on averages gathered from large groups of patients. Each couple is unique, so think of the success rate for any treatment as a general snapshot, not a prediction of your chances of having a baby. Read on to learn more about female infertility and available fertility treatments .  Ovulation problems An ovulation problem occurs when eggs don't mature in the ovaries or when the ovaries fail to release a mature egg. This is sometimes known as premature ovarian failure . Ovulation problems are common in women with infertility. Possible symptoms: Absent or infrequent periods , unusually light or heavy menstrual bleeding, or lack of such premenstrual symptoms as bloating or breast tenderness. Possible solutions: Managing body weight if it's too low or too high, taking fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination ), and having in vitro fertilization (IVF) . Success rates: Thirty to 40 percent of women taking clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation become pregnant by the third treatment cycle. When fertility drugs to increase egg production are combined with artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 10 and 20 percent per treatment cycle. The percentage of IVF treatment cycles resulting in a live birth (in which one or more babies are born) is about: 40 percent for women age 34 and under 31 percent for women age 35 to 37 21 percent for women age 38 to 40 11 percent for women age 41 to 42 5 percent for women age 43 and over  Endometriosis Endometriosis is a condition that occurs when tissue normally found in the lining of the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows outside the uterus, usually in the abdomen or pelvis. Possible symptoms: Some women have no symptoms, while others have painful periods or intercourse, heavy bleeding or unusual spotting, and general pelvic pain. Possible solutions: Surgery to remove endometrial tissue or open blocked fallopian tubes, fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination), and IVF. Success rates: A large study found that 30 percent of women with infertility related to early stage endometriosis conceived naturally within three years after having laparoscopic surgery to remove endometrial tissue. When women with early stage endometriosis are treated with fertility drugs and artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 15 percent per treatment cycle. The live birth rate per treatment cycle for women with endometriosis who undergo IVF ranges from 2 to 42 percent, depending on the woman's age.  Poor egg quality The quality and number of eggs the ovaries produce – naturally or with fertility treatment – declines significantly after age 35. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs, IVF using your own eggs, IVF with donor eggs or donor embryos . Success rates: Women who have IVF using donor eggs have an approximate 55 percent chance of having a baby per IVF cycle.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which small follicles in the ovaries don't develop into the larger, mature follicles that release eggs. It's also characterized by hormone imbalances and unpredictable ovulation patterns . Possible symptoms:  irregular periods , excessive hair growth, acne, and obesity. Possible solutions: Lifestyle modifications (like diet and exercise), clomiphene citrate, injected fertility drugs, ovarian drilling (a surgical procedure that can trigger ovulation), and IVF. In women with glucose intolerance, the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage) can also help restore regular ovulation. Success rates: Many overweight patients who lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight start ovulating regularly. For women with PCOS who take clomiphene citrate, the pregnancy rate per treatment cycle is about 18 percent. For women treated with ovarian drilling, about 50 percent get pregnant within one year.  Tubal factors Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes prevent sperm from getting to your egg and also prevent the fertilized egg from getting to your uterus. Leading causes of tube problems include pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted infections (such as chlamydia), and previous sterilization surgery. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Surgery to open the tubes. If surgery fails, or if the tubes are too damaged to repair, they may be removed before having IVF in order to improve your chances of pregnancy. Success rates: Conception rates after surgery vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the tube blockage and the amount of postoperative scar tissue that develops. Couples with tubal factor infertility who try IVF have a 22 percent chance on average of having a baby per IVF treatment cycle. This depends on the woman's age, extent of tubal disease or whether the tubes have been removed, and several other factors.  Unexplained fertility problems Your doctor may diagnose an unexplained fertility problem if there's no obvious reason for your infertility (meaning all test results are normal). Some experts believe subtle differences in the way the reproductive system works may cause this type of infertility. This can include differences in follicle development, sperm function, or the fertilization process. Experts also theorize that lifestyle factors – such as being significantly underweight or overweight, regularly consuming too much caffeine or alcohol, and smoking – may be contributing factors as well. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination) or IVF. Success rates: For couples with unexplained infertility, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 26 percent per treatment cycle when fertility drugs are used in combination with artificial insemination. With IVF, the live birth rate is about 30 percent per treatment cycle, but that figure varies depending on age.     Show sources       Hide sources       SART. 2013. Fertility data table.

Possible solutions: Surgery to open the tubes. If surgery fails, or if the tubes are too damaged to repair, they may be removed before having IVF in order to improve your chances of pregnancy. Success rates: Conception rates after surgery vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the tube blockage and the amount of postoperative scar tissue that develops. Couples with tubal factor infertility who try IVF have a 22 percent chance on average of having a baby per IVF treatment cycle. This depends on the woman's age, extent of tubal disease or whether the tubes have been removed, and several other factors.  Unexplained fertility problems Your doctor may diagnose an unexplained fertility problem if there's no obvious reason for your infertility (meaning all test results are normal). Some experts believe subtle differences in the way the reproductive system works may cause this type of infertility. This can include differences in follicle development, sperm function, or the fertilization process. Experts also theorize that lifestyle factors – such as being significantly underweight or overweight, regularly consuming too much caffeine or alcohol, and smoking – may be contributing factors as well. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination) or IVF. Success rates: For couples with unexplained infertility, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 26 percent per treatment cycle when fertility drugs are used in combination with artificial insemination. With IVF, the live birth rate is about 30 percent per treatment cycle, but that figure varies depending on age.     Show sources       Hide sources       SART. 2013. Fertility data table.

About one-third of these cases are due to female fertility problems, one-third to male fertility problems, and the rest to factors involving both partners or to unexplained causes. If you've had regular, unprotected sex for more than a year without conceiving (or six months if you're older than 35), see your doctor . About 65 percent of couples that get treatment for a fertility problem are eventually able to have a successful pregnancy, according to Resolve, the national infertility association. The success rates below are based on averages gathered from large groups of patients. Each couple is unique, so think of the success rate for any treatment as a general snapshot, not a prediction of your chances of having a baby. Read on to learn more about female infertility and available fertility treatments .  Ovulation problems An ovulation problem occurs when eggs don't mature in the ovaries or when the ovaries fail to release a mature egg. This is sometimes known as premature ovarian failure . Ovulation problems are common in women with infertility. Possible symptoms: Absent or infrequent periods , unusually light or heavy menstrual bleeding, or lack of such premenstrual symptoms as bloating or breast tenderness. Possible solutions: Managing body weight if it's too low or too high, taking fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination ), and having in vitro fertilization (IVF) . Success rates: Thirty to 40 percent of women taking clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation become pregnant by the third treatment cycle. When fertility drugs to increase egg production are combined with artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 10 and 20 percent per treatment cycle. The percentage of IVF treatment cycles resulting in a live birth (in which one or more babies are born) is about: 40 percent for women age 34 and under 31 percent for women age 35 to 37 21 percent for women age 38 to 40 11 percent for women age 41 to 42 5 percent for women age 43 and over  Endometriosis Endometriosis is a condition that occurs when tissue normally found in the lining of the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows outside the uterus, usually in the abdomen or pelvis. Possible symptoms: Some women have no symptoms, while others have painful periods or intercourse, heavy bleeding or unusual spotting, and general pelvic pain. Possible solutions: Surgery to remove endometrial tissue or open blocked fallopian tubes, fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination), and IVF. Success rates: A large study found that 30 percent of women with infertility related to early stage endometriosis conceived naturally within three years after having laparoscopic surgery to remove endometrial tissue. When women with early stage endometriosis are treated with fertility drugs and artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 15 percent per treatment cycle. The live birth rate per treatment cycle for women with endometriosis who undergo IVF ranges from 2 to 42 percent, depending on the woman's age.  Poor egg quality The quality and number of eggs the ovaries produce – naturally or with fertility treatment – declines significantly after age 35. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs, IVF using your own eggs, IVF with donor eggs or donor embryos . Success rates: Women who have IVF using donor eggs have an approximate 55 percent chance of having a baby per IVF cycle.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which small follicles in the ovaries don't develop into the larger, mature follicles that release eggs. It's also characterized by hormone imbalances and unpredictable ovulation patterns . Possible symptoms:  irregular periods , excessive hair growth, acne, and obesity. Possible solutions: Lifestyle modifications (like diet and exercise), clomiphene citrate, injected fertility drugs, ovarian drilling (a surgical procedure that can trigger ovulation), and IVF. In women with glucose intolerance, the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage) can also help restore regular ovulation. Success rates: Many overweight patients who lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight start ovulating regularly. For women with PCOS who take clomiphene citrate, the pregnancy rate per treatment cycle is about 18 percent. For women treated with ovarian drilling, about 50 percent get pregnant within one year.  Tubal factors Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes prevent sperm from getting to your egg and also prevent the fertilized egg from getting to your uterus. Leading causes of tube problems include pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted infections (such as chlamydia), and previous sterilization surgery. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Surgery to open the tubes. If surgery fails, or if the tubes are too damaged to repair, they may be removed before having IVF in order to improve your chances of pregnancy. Success rates: Conception rates after surgery vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the tube blockage and the amount of postoperative scar tissue that develops. Couples with tubal factor infertility who try IVF have a 22 percent chance on average of having a baby per IVF treatment cycle. This depends on the woman's age, extent of tubal disease or whether the tubes have been removed, and several other factors.

About one-third of these cases are due to female fertility problems, one-third to male fertility problems, and the rest to factors involving both partners or to unexplained causes. If you've had regular, unprotected sex for more than a year without conceiving (or six months if you're older than 35), see your doctor . About 65 percent of couples that get treatment for a fertility problem are eventually able to have a successful pregnancy, according to Resolve, the national infertility association. The success rates below are based on averages gathered from large groups of patients. Each couple is unique, so think of the success rate for any treatment as a general snapshot, not a prediction of your chances of having a baby. Read on to learn more about female infertility and available fertility treatments .  Ovulation problems An ovulation problem occurs when eggs don't mature in the ovaries or when the ovaries fail to release a mature egg. This is sometimes known as premature ovarian failure . Ovulation problems are common in women with infertility. Possible symptoms: Absent or infrequent periods , unusually light or heavy menstrual bleeding, or lack of such premenstrual symptoms as bloating or breast tenderness. Possible solutions: Managing body weight if it's too low or too high, taking fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination ), and having in vitro fertilization (IVF) . Success rates: Thirty to 40 percent of women taking clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation become pregnant by the third treatment cycle. When fertility drugs to increase egg production are combined with artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 10 and 20 percent per treatment cycle. The percentage of IVF treatment cycles resulting in a live birth (in which one or more babies are born) is about: 40 percent for women age 34 and under 31 percent for women age 35 to 37 21 percent for women age 38 to 40 11 percent for women age 41 to 42 5 percent for women age 43 and over  Endometriosis Endometriosis is a condition that occurs when tissue normally found in the lining of the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows outside the uterus, usually in the abdomen or pelvis. Possible symptoms: Some women have no symptoms, while others have painful periods or intercourse, heavy bleeding or unusual spotting, and general pelvic pain. Possible solutions: Surgery to remove endometrial tissue or open blocked fallopian tubes, fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination), and IVF. Success rates: A large study found that 30 percent of women with infertility related to early stage endometriosis conceived naturally within three years after having laparoscopic surgery to remove endometrial tissue. When women with early stage endometriosis are treated with fertility drugs and artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 15 percent per treatment cycle. The live birth rate per treatment cycle for women with endometriosis who undergo IVF ranges from 2 to 42 percent, depending on the woman's age.  Poor egg quality The quality and number of eggs the ovaries produce – naturally or with fertility treatment – declines significantly after age 35. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs, IVF using your own eggs, IVF with donor eggs or donor embryos . Success rates: Women who have IVF using donor eggs have an approximate 55 percent chance of having a baby per IVF cycle.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which small follicles in the ovaries don't develop into the larger, mature follicles that release eggs. It's also characterized by hormone imbalances and unpredictable ovulation patterns . Possible symptoms:  irregular periods , excessive hair growth, acne, and obesity. Possible solutions: Lifestyle modifications (like diet and exercise), clomiphene citrate, injected fertility drugs, ovarian drilling (a surgical procedure that can trigger ovulation), and IVF. In women with glucose intolerance, the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage) can also help restore regular ovulation. Success rates: Many overweight patients who lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight start ovulating regularly. For women with PCOS who take clomiphene citrate, the pregnancy rate per treatment cycle is about 18 percent. For women treated with ovarian drilling, about 50 percent get pregnant within one year.  Tubal factors Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes prevent sperm from getting to your egg and also prevent the fertilized egg from getting to your uterus. Leading causes of tube problems include pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted infections (such as chlamydia), and previous sterilization surgery. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Surgery to open the tubes. If surgery fails, or if the tubes are too damaged to repair, they may be removed before having IVF in order to improve your chances of pregnancy. Success rates: Conception rates after surgery vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the tube blockage and the amount of postoperative scar tissue that develops. Couples with tubal factor infertility who try IVF have a 22 percent chance on average of having a baby per IVF treatment cycle. This depends on the woman's age, extent of tubal disease or whether the tubes have been removed, and several other factors.  Unexplained fertility problems Your doctor may diagnose an unexplained fertility problem if there's no obvious reason for your infertility (meaning all test results are normal). Some experts believe subtle differences in the way the reproductive system works may cause this type of infertility. This can include differences in follicle development, sperm function, or the fertilization process. Experts also theorize that lifestyle factors – such as being significantly underweight or overweight, regularly consuming too much caffeine or alcohol, and smoking – may be contributing factors as well. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination) or IVF. Success rates: For couples with unexplained infertility, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 26 percent per treatment cycle when fertility drugs are used in combination with artificial insemination. With IVF, the live birth rate is about 30 percent per treatment cycle, but that figure varies depending on age.     Show sources       Hide sources       SART. 2013. Fertility data table.

Here are seven common myths to watch out for -- and help dispel. Myth 1: It's easy for most women to get pregnant. While it's true that many woman conceive without difficulty, more than five million people of childbearing age in the United States -- or one in every 10 couples -- have problems with infertility. Certain health conditions and factors, such as age, can affect a woman's ability to conceive. For instance, a healthy 30-year-old woman has about a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant each month; while by age 40, her chances drop to about 5 percent a month. But infertility can affect women of any age, and from any background. Myth 2: Men don't have infertility problems. Though it's commonly believed that infertility is a "women's problem," nothing is further from the truth. About 35 percent of all infertility cases treated in the United States are due to a female problem. But 35 percent (an equal number!) can be traced to a male problem, 20 percent to a problem in both partners, and 10 percent to unknown causes. Myth 3: Infertility is a psychological -- not physical -- problem. Well-meaning friends and relatives may suggest "infertility is all in your head" or "if you'd stop worrying so much, you'd get pregnant." But in reality, infertility is a disease or condition of the reproductive system -- and not a psychological disorder. In fact, one or more physical causes are identified in the vast number of infertile couples. So while relaxing, going on vacation, or finding positive ways to de-stress can improve your overall well-being, these lifestyle changes won't solve your infertility problems. Myth 4: Couples who "work" hard enough at having a baby will eventually get pregnant. New methods of diagnosing and treating infertility have improved many couples' chances of having a baby. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), more than half of all couples who pursue treatment will achieve a successful pregnancy. On the other hand, it's important to remember that infertility is a medical disease and that problems sometimes remain untreatable -- no matter how hard a couple "works" at solving them. Myth 5: Once a couple adopts a child, the woman will become pregnant. This particular myth is not only painful for infertile couples to hear, but it's also untrue. First of all, it suggests that adoption is simply a means to an end (a pregnancy), and not, in and of itself, a valid and wonderful way to form a family. Secondly, only about 5 percent of couples who do adopt later become pregnant. This success rate is the same for couples who don't adopt and become pregnant without further treatment. Myth 6: Husbands often leave their wives if they're infertile. As stated earlier, infertility is a medical condition that affects both men and women equally. In fact, about 40 percent of the time, the male partner is either the sole or contributing cause of infertility, according to ASRM. While many couples do find the process of infertility testing and treatment rigorous, stressful, and intrusive (not to mention costly), they do get through it -- together. Many partners also find new and deeper ways of relating to each other and discover that their marriage has become even stronger. Myth 7: Infertile couples will never be happy or fulfilled. Being unable to conceive a much-wanted child (or carry a pregnancy to term) can fill a couple with sadness, grief, anger, despair, and even a sense of personal failure. While it's normal for infertile couples to experience a range of powerful emotions, most people do move through this life crisis successfully and gradually put it into better perspective. For some couples, "moving on" means letting go of their initial dreams of having a baby. Other couples decide to adopt. But in either case, couples do learn that there is life after infertility and find myriad ways to fulfill themselves -- with or without children.

You're not alone, no matter what age you are. Although it's no secret that pregnancy risks do increase as you age, there is still good news for moms looking to conceive. Get the details about infertility at every decade, including the risks to you and your baby, and ways to boost your fertility. By Dina Roth Port  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Women of all ages know far too well what it's like to hear their biological clock ticking away. It can be stressful knowing there's a time limit to fertility, but as with all health issues, knowledge is power. Here's a look at the pros and cons of attempting to get pregnant in each decade, and what you can do to better your chances. Are You Maximizing Your Fertility? In Your 20s         Shutterstock  Odds of Getting Pregnant Biologically, this is the prime time to get pregnant. In fact, the odds that a woman in her 20s will get pregnant each month are around 20 to 25 percent, the highest they'll ever be. But this doesn't mean that young women can't face fertility issues. "No one is immune to infertility," says Richard Paulson, M.D., chief of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. "While women in their 20s generally have good egg quality, all the other causes of infertility can still be present, such as tubal issues and low sperm count in the male partner." Your Health From a physical standpoint, there are many benefits to starting a family in your 20s. Not only do you have higher odds of getting pregnant, you also have lower chances of experiencing complications such as miscarriages and chromosomally abnormal pregnancies, as well as health issues that include gestational diabetes. On average, younger women's bodies can often handle the demands of pregnancy better than their older counterparts can, and new moms in their 20s may have a lot more energy to run after toddlers. Plus, if you want to have a large family, you'll have more time to space out birthing your kids. Just keep in mind: Many experts recommend that women wait at least 18 months or more before trying to get pregnant again. Talk to your doctor about what's best for you. The Risks The risk of developing preeclampsia -- when a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in her urine -- is highest among first pregnancies, when most women in their 20s are likely expecting for the first time. Preeclampsia, in rare cases, can lead to serious complications for both the mother and fetus, but it is usually manageable. There's also the emotional factor of having kids at a young age, especially when women veer off their professional path, which they might regret down the road. "Many women who conceive in their 20s feel like they didn't pursue their dreams or achieve the career goals they had hoped they would," explains Aimee Raupp, fertility expert and author of Yes, You Can Get Pregnant: Natural Ways to Improve Your Fertility Now and into your 40s . "Some say they rushed into getting married or finding their partner and now have some regrets surrounding their relationship." (Of course, that's not always the end of the story: Once these women's kids are older, many resume following their passions.) Some women in their 20s still have a lot of debt (like school loans) and they might not be as financially secure as they'd like to be before bringing a child into the mix. This can add a lot of stress to any relationship. Common Causes of Infertility Risks to the Baby All pregnancies come with risks, but many risks increase with age. According to the American Pregnancy Association, the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is 1/1600 at age 20 and 1/1300 at age 25. Risks of any chromosomal abnormality are 1/526 and 1/476, respectively. But keep in mind that these are the risks at birth . "The vast majority of pregnancies with chromosomal abnormalities at any age result in spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester," says Eric Widra, M.D., medical director of the Shady Grove Fertility Center, a leading fertility center in the United States, and director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Georgetown University. Ways to Boost Fertility Younger women might still have some bad habits left over from their high school or college days that can sabotage fertility. They may still subsist on a diet composed of a lot of fast food and alcohol, or they may not have lost the "Freshman 15." The good news is that women in their 20s can still take steps to optimize their odds of getting pregnant. For instance, weight plays an important role in conception, but many young women tend to be very underweight or overweight, explains Raupp. "Maintaining a normal BMI and adopting a pre-conception plan of eating a nutrient-dense diet, limiting alcohol and caffeine, and avoiding cigarettes helps a woman achieve her most optimal health prior to conception," she says. "That way, she can more likely conceive with ease, have a healthy pregnancy, and bring a child into a healthy home." When to Seek Help Traditionally, women in their 20s have been advised to seek help from a fertility specialist after trying to get pregnant for a full year, but some experts suggest you should see a doctor even sooner. "I recommend getting help after six months of trying, even sooner if you suspect something is wrong, such as having irregular periods," says Dr. Paulson. In fact, if you aren't getting your period at all or if your cycles are longer than every 35 days, seek help immediately, says Dr. Widra. Talk to your doctor if you have a family history of early menopause or a known history of pelvic abnormalities, sexual dysfunction, or any other medical conditions that might affect fertility, including your partner's medical problems, which may affect his sperm count. Treatment Options The treatment options don't vary much based on age -- they just vary in their effectiveness. For instance, there's ovulation induction through the use of oral medication and intrauterine inseminations. "In vitro fertilization [IVF] is the most effective treatment for most forms of infertility," says Dr. Widra. For women under 35, the success rate of IVF is 41 to 43 percent, according to the American Pregnancy Association. Along with age, however, factors that can affect whether or not IVF works include a woman's reproductive history, her particular diagnosis, and her partner's sperm count. Don't discount the male's role in fertility. "Male factors are present in 30 to 50 percent of couples seeking care for infertility," says Dr. Widra. "Semen analyses are, as I tell my patients, pain-free, risk-free, and inexpensive. This is a critical step in evaluation." In Your 30s Odds of Getting Pregnant On average, a woman in her 30s has a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant each month. Fertility gradually declines throughout the decade, especially after age 35. Your Health         Goodluz/Shutterstock  Women in their 30s still have the stamina to handle middle-of-the-night feedings and basic baby care, and they have more financial security than when they were younger. "A woman in her 30s is more settled in her own skin, and since her peer group is more likely to have children around the same age, she has that support network," adds Raupp. Though fertility is dipping a bit, it's not necessarily in the danger zone, especially for women in their early 30s. The Risks According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, as a woman reaches her mid- to late 30s, she's less likely to become pregnant and more like to have miscarriages because the quality and quantity of her eggs are dwindling. Women at this age might feel tremendous anxiety when it comes to having children. "Women in their 30s are trying to keep up with their friends who are starting a family, and their doctors and family members often pressure them to get pregnant immediately for fear of fertility challenges due to advancing maternal age," says Raupp. "I often see a lot of emotional stress surrounding conception for these women." Risks to the Baby The risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is 1/1000 for mothers who give birth at 30 and 1/365 for those who give birth at 35. Risks of any chromosomal abnormality are 1/384 and 1/197, respectively. Ways to Boost Fertility Along with making sure their weight falls in a normal BMI range and that they are following a preconception plan, women in their 30s should consider the birth control they've been using. "If they've been on the pill for over five years, they should plan to stop it before trying to conceive," says Raupp. "The body may need time to reestablish a regular ovulatory cycle." Although some women may have delays in resuming their menstruation cycle, plenty of women will still be able to get pregnant right away. In fact, "the vast majority of women will revert to their historical cycle pattern and fertility as soon as they stop," says Dr. Widra. So you don't have to stop taking birth control too far in advance of trying to conceive, but always consult your gynecologist about the best plan for you. When to Seek Help Women in their early 30s should get help after trying for six months to a year; those between 35 and 39 should definitely seek assistance after six months. If you have any of the risk factors mentioned for women in their 20s, talk to your doctor about possibly seeing a specialist sooner. Treatment Options A woman in her 30s has the same options as women in their 20s, but the course of action might vary by the diagnosis, the specific age of a patient, and other factors, says Dr. Widra. If you're going to seek treatment for infertility, it's best to do it sooner than later, especially if you want to get pregnant without the use of donor eggs. "The real issue with aging is that the opportunity to help couples declines rapidly with age, and time becomes a more valuable commodity," says Dr. Widra. In Your 40s Odds of Getting Pregnant By age 40, a woman's odds of getting pregnant is less than 5 percent each month. For women ages 45 to 49, those odds dip as low as 1 percent. Pregnancy Risks After Age 35 Your Health         Goodluz/Shutterstock  Many women who have children in their 40s feel very prepared for motherhood, even though they know the odds are lower when it comes to fertility. "Women in their 40s often seem at peace around the potential obstacles when it comes to conceiving," adds Raupp. "That's not to say that many of them aren't dealing with the same stressors of younger women, but they seem more at ease in their own skin, more confident mentally and financially, and more willing to follow a plan to optimize their health and fertility." The Risks But all obstetrical risks (such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, miscarriage, delivery complications, the need for a Cesarean, prolonged labor, and giving birth to a child with a genetic disorder) increase as a woman gets older. And the quantity and quality of a woman's eggs -- the key to fertility -- are both rapidly declining. "In the world of reproduction, nothing gets better with age," says Dr. Paulson. Risks to the Baby The risk of Down syndrome is 1/90 at age 40 and 1/30 at age 45. Risks of any chromosomal abnormality is 1/66 and 1/21, respectively. Ways to Boost Fertility Along with the healthy lifestyle changes that women in their 20s and 30s should adopt, it helps greatly to put things in perspective. "Age shouldn't always be taken as a guarantee of fertility," says Raupp. "When one optimizes health -- mentally, physically, and nutritionally -- then fertility may optimize as well. My biggest message to all women who are trying to conceive is to have faith in your body, treat it like the palace that it is, and do what you can to achieve emotional peace." This includes making sure you get plenty of sleep each night and that you do what you can to limit stress. Some experts recommend yoga, acupuncture, exercise, or meditation accomplish that, but always talk to your doctor about what's right for you. When to Seek Help The jury's out on when women in their 40s should seek help from a fertility specialist: some say after three months of trying to get pregnant naturally; others say six. But there's nothing wrong with being preemptive. "For women in their 40s whose time is very precious, it's perfectly okay to go in for basic testing even prior to trying," says Dr. Paulson. Treatment Options Women in their 40s have the same treatment options as do those in their 20s and 30s, though success rates are drastically lower. For instance, by age 44, a woman's odds of becoming pregnant through IVF are less than10 percent. Keep in mind, however, that while it's true to say that fertility declines with age, it's more precise to say that it declines with the age of a woman's eggs. That's why older women might want to (or need to) consider egg donation as a means of getting pregnant. "Women in their 40s who are recipients of eggs donated by younger women get pregnant at the same rate as the women who donate those eggs," explains Dr. Paulson. "That is why egg donation is so effective in circumventing the biological clock -- it's all about the egg!" Trying to Conceive: 5 Common Fertility Mistakes Copyright © 2015 Meredith Corporation.

You’re Not the Only One By Elli Thompson Purtell Apr 20 2015 A few years ago, at the ripe old age of 26, I confided to a friend that I was convinced I would have a hard time getting pregnant . To be clear, I wasn’t trying to get pregnant . I wasn’t even considering trying to get pregnant anytime in the near future. I simply had a dreaded feeling that it would be a struggle whenever the day arrived. I expected my friend to be surprised, to ask why, to tell me not to worry because it would work out. Instead, she rolled her eyes and said, “Elli, everyone thinks she can’t get pregnant.” I was floored. Don’t women spend most of their adulthood worrying about the opposite? But as it turns out, my friend was on to something. Over the next year or so, as conversations about babies became more prevalent within my age group, I talked to more and more women who felt the same way. We were all younger than 30, and though we'd never tried, we shared the same worry we'd never be able to conceive. While the discourse about infertility is beyond needed, it can also have an unintended side effect: In some cases, women are changing their life plans based on the fear that they too will have trouble conceiving. A post on a babyandbump.com discussion board sums it up best: “I thought I was the only one! I don’t know why I would think this, but I have a deep fear of not being able to conceive.” With increased openness about infertility and IVF treatments and ongoing and discussions about America’s “infertility crisis,” women are thinking about — and fearing — infertility more than ever. While the discourse about infertility is beyond needed, it can also have an unintended side effect: In some cases, women are changing their life plans based on the fear that they too will have trouble conceiving. Courtney Unger, a nurse and mother of two living in Minneapolis, was fairly certain she would have trouble getting pregnant when she was married at 25. “For whatever reason, I assumed it would take a while,” she tells Bustle. “My mom had a hard time conceiving, so I think I was just under the assumption that the majority of people had a hard time getting pregnant.”Instead, Courtney got pregnant on her honeymoon, just over a month after going off the birth control pill. “Hell yeah, we were surprised!” she says. “I realized that I was due to get my period, which was always very regular when on the pill, so I thought maybe my body was just adjusting to new hormones.” 94 percent of women are fertile, and 89 percent will not have any trouble getting pregnant. Although the chances of getting pregnant in one try like Courtney are fairly low (20–40 percent) , 85 percent of all couples trying to conceive will get pregnant within 12 months . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 94 percent of American women are fertile and 89 percent will not have any trouble getting pregnant. The numbers are similar in Great Britain, where according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service , 90 percent of women age 19–39 will conceive after two years of actively trying to have a baby. Yet panic remains, and it’s not hard to see why. Infertility is real . The stigma attached to childless women is real. Watching others suffer from infertility is gut wrenching, and imagining going through that painful experience contributes to women’s fears and doctors’ warnings. Julianne Zweifel, a clinical psychologist and clinical adjunct professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , regularly witnesses the heartbreak of infertility in her profession. '[If you're young], the odds [of getting pregnant] are still dramatically in your favor," she says. “But if you’re the person on the negative end of that percentage, it’s bad. When you are 30 years old and you have fertility problems, you are even angrier than when you’re 36.” “You have a backdrop in society of women having kids later and later,” Zweifel says. “You think, ‘Maybe this is more possible’ and you’re lulled into a false sense of security. [But] we weren’t just created in 2014 with bodies that were created in 2014. It really might work out, but the older you get, the less likely that is.” The other side of this story — unplanned pregnancies or rushed timelines — has consequences of its own: financial stress, sacrificing an education or a career, relationship/marriage struggles, resentment and low self-esteem, just to name a few. Half of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and 40 percent of those end in abortion. Colleen Krajewski, M.D. MPH, a gynecologist affiliated with The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , feels strongly about drawing equal attention to the consequences of perceived infertility, especially because they are more likely to occur than infertility itself. Half of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and 40 percent of those end in abortion. “This seems much less talked about than infertility," Krajewski says. "My perspective is that I see women on an almost daily basis who have an unintended pregnancy based on incorrectly perceived infertility, and my patients can also feel ashamed, guilty, or stigmatized.” With a barrage of statistics and an endless supply of messages on infertility floating around, Zweifel and Krajewski agree that women must educate themselves and visit their doctors to gain a thorough understanding of what all this information means. Basing a decision on one article, a targeted campaign , or what a friend heard may not be the best approach. For example, women hear all the time that age affects fertility. Although this is true and should not be taken lightly, it’s important to understand how and to what extent it plays a role. The chances of becoming pregnant quickly (within a year) decrease significantly as women age, particularly after age 35. According to a study in Helen A. Cacio's Management of the Infertile Woman  , women ages 20–24 have an 86 percent chance of conceiving within a year. Women ages 30–34 have a 63 percent chance. The chances of women of all those ages becoming pregnant after trying for two years , however, leaps up to 90–94 percent . “I think it’s good to talk to your doctor about any risk factors you may actually have, as opposed to perceive, with regard to infertility, and also the actual incidence of infertility with age,” Krajewski says. "I encourage women and couples to parent when they are ready. Don't push up your timetable based on fear." She also suggests setting aside a specific visit for “ preconception counseling ,” rather than asking a quick question at the end of an annual exam, to ensure a thorough review of medical history and enough time to create a plan for optimizing pregnancy chances. “Each woman can make a decision about what risk of infertility she’s OK with,” Krajewski says. “I encourage women and couples to parent when they are ready. Don’t push up your timetable based on fear. On the other hand, have a realistic expectation that conception may not be as easy at age 40 as at age 20.” At age 29, I now feel a sense of peace having a better understanding of fertility. I also visited my gynecologist specifically to ask questions and better understand my fertility . I want children badly, but I also know that now is not the right time. Although I’ll never truly know if I can get pregnant until I try, it’s immensely liberating to allow logic to lead the way. Deciding when and why to have children is a personal decision for every woman, and knowledge, not fear, will breed the best choices.

The Key Signs of Pregnancy Home Pregnancy Tests            While most of us may think that when it comes down to it we’ll be able to have a baby with no trouble at all, encountering fertility problems can be a very real hurdle for a lot of couples. In fact, in about 20% of infertility cases , there can be no direct cause established (IVF can be particularly helpful in such cases).  There are some quite common issues, however, and we will cover those here. Since most people who do not have underlying fertility problems will be able to get pregnant within a year, if it’s taking you longer than that it’s a good time to contact your healthcare providers. They will be able to refer you to a fertility specialist, who will explain you how to have a baby despite these very common fertility problems.  Trouble with Ovulation  This is where it begins, because if you are not ovulating (either at all, or regularly), you simply will not get pregnant. Your healthcare provider will be able to carry out the necessary tests to find out the source of the problem and will evaluate whether or not you are suffering from any conditions that commonly cause ovulation interruption, such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS causes cysts on the ovaries, which often stops eggs from reaching the fallopian tubes (wherein they would travel to your womb, and attach as a pregnancy). You may have this condition if you experience disproportionate hair growth, acne, have erratic or faint periods, or if you’ve gained a lot of weight.  Many women successfully overcome their PCOS and go on to deliver healthy babies. Your doctor will suggest a combination of weight loss, fertility drugs and treatments, and hormone therapy. Some women are good candidates for laser treatment on their ovaries. Even if your ovulation issues are not PCOS-related, your specialists will use these measures to best stimulate your ovaries into working correctly. You may be offered fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI).  Whether or not you are suffering from PCOS, you may be advised to lose some weight and start living a healthier lifestyle with a balanced diet. Being overweight can greatly affect your chances of getting pregnant. You should consult your doctor to determine the ideal weight for you and take care not to become too underweight either, as it will have a similarly negative impact on your wish to have a baby.  Trouble with Sperm  Oligospermia, or low sperm count, is one of the fertility problems that can be slightly easier to overcome (as is asthenospermia, or sperm that isn’t very fast). He may find that losing a little weight and consuming less alcohol will reverse the problem. If it doesn’t, it may be the case that his problems are a little more complex than first thought. His doctor will examine a sperm sample (if ejaculation is not possible, it can be collected directly from his testes), and is then able to extract the fastest, most mobile sperm. Using IUI, his best sperm can then be injected directly into your uterus when you are ovulating. You will most likely be given a hormonal injection to give your egg the best chance of being fertilized by his sperm.  Sometimes, however, there are not sufficient healthy sperm in a semen sample to qualify for an IUI. In this case, an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (or ICSI) could be an option. It’s a difficult and lengthy process, during which the woman must undergo extensive hormone treatment to make sure she releases as many eggs as possible (which must then be harvested from her). If he does not produce any sperm at all, and is wondering, “But how can we get pregnant now?”, it may be time to consider a sperm donor .  Endometriosis  Within your uterus, there is a tissue called the endometrium. When you have endometriosis, this tissue can begin to grow outside of your womb, usually on your ovaries or the lining of your stomach. This condition can be extremely painful and is usually at its worst when you menstruate. It’s possible to have treatment to deal with the endometriosis, but this is separate from handling the infertility it can cause (though it may help). If the growing endometrium has obstructed your fallopian tubes or ovaries, IVF may be necessary to conceive.  Fallopian Tubes  When your fallopian tubes are blocked, it means that eggs cannot travel successfully from your ovaries to your womb. The blockages can have many causes: endometriosis (which we just talked about), fibroids (which we will cover in a moment), or complications from a previous procedure in that area. Since the egg cannot reach the safety of the womb, it will sometimes attach to the lining of the fallopian tubes, and if it is fertilized this will cause an ectopic pregnancy. If just one tube is obstructed, you still have a chance at getting pregnant every second month, as you still have one tube that’s open. Sometimes all it takes is a simple surgery to remove a part of the tube and restore it to function, although if it is more complicated, IVF may be the best option. In this eventuality, the sperm and egg will be extracted from the partners, mixed in a lab, and a couple of fertilized eggs are transplanted back into the woman’s uterus, thus bypassing the fallopian tubes altogether.  Fibroids  Fibroids are benign tumors in your uterus and can be extremely painful, especially during sex. They also cause excessive bleeding during menstruation, and if ignored will just continue to grow. Fibroids are not exactly the cause of infertility, but because they grow within your womb they can hinder pregnancy greatly or even prevent it completely. If you are diagnosed with this condition, you will be offered drugs to minimize the fibroids, and they can also be surgically removed.

There are also risk factors, things that make it more likely you may have difficulty getting pregnant. While many couples will have no signs or symptoms, if you do have any, you should talk to your doctor sooner than later. Infertility is defined by how long you have been trying to conceive unsuccessfully.         If you have been trying for one year without success—or for six months, if you’re age 35 or older —then your doctor will diagnose you as being infertile. But do you have to try for a year to know if there may be a problem? Here are some questions to ask yourself and your partner. If you answer yes to any of these, speak to your doctor  before you spend a year trying on your own. Irregular Menstrual Cycles When menstruation begins, having irregular periods can be normal. It takes the body awhile to get regulated. Once you’ve passed your teenage years, your cycles should be regular. An irregular cycle can be a red flag for infertility problems and may be a sign of an ovulation problem. If your cycles are unusually short or long (less than 24 days or more than 35 days), or they come unpredictably, speak with your doctor. If you don't get your periods at all, you absolutely must talk to your doctor.   There are a variety of causes for irregular periods. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of irregular cycles and ovulation-related infertility. Other possible causes for irregular periods include hyperprolactinemia, primary ovarian insufficiency , thyroid dysfunction, low ovarian reserves , being over or underweight, and excessive exercise .         Light/Heavy Bleeding and Cramps Bleeding for anything between three to seven days can be considered normal. However, if the bleeding is very light or extremely heavy and intense, you should see your doctor. Other period-related symptoms that may indicate a fertility problem include: Significant changes in bleeding heaviness Significant changes in the length of bleeding days Severe menstrual cramps Unusual spotting between cycles Menstrual cramps that interfere with your daily life can be a symptom of endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease , both of which can cause infertility. Both of these diseases get worse with time, so it’s important you don’t delay seeking help. Age: Older Than 35 Both female and male fertility declines with age. The risk of infertility increases at age 35 for women and continues to grow with time. A 30-year-old woman has a 20 percent chance of conceiving in any one month, while a 40-year-old woman has only a 5 percent chance. Women over 35 are also more likely to experience a miscarriage and to have a child with a congenital disease. Male fertility is also affected by age , though not as drastically as in women. Research has found that with increased age, male fertility and sperm health decreases, including an increase in DNA-damaged sperm.         Male age has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, the passing on of genetic problems, and some congenital disabilities. Increased male age has also been associated with increased rates of autism and schizophrenia. A number of surveys and research studies over the years have found that many women (and men) are unaware of how much female fertility declines with age. People frequently overestimate their chances of conceiving at age 40 or 44. Or they assume IVF treatment alone can solve the issue. (It can't.) A fascinating study looked at what age a couple should start trying to have a family, based on how many kids they eventually want to have and whether they are open to IVF treatment.  If you’re not open to IVF treatment, you should start trying to conceive By age 32, if you want a 90 percent chance of having one child By age 27, if you want two children By age 23, if you want three children If you are open to IVF, the study suggests starting your family By age 35, if you want a 90 percent chance of having one child By age 31, if you want two kids By age 28, if you want three kids IVF treatment is also impacted by male age. One study found that for each additional year of paternal age, there was an 11 percent increased odds of not achieving pregnancy and a 12 percent increase in the odds of not having a live birth. Of course, even if you are young, you’re not guaranteed a baby. Young men and women can also experience infertility. Partner Fertility Male factor infertility isn't always so obvious, and there are rarely symptoms. Usually, low sperm counts or inhibited sperm mobility is determined by a sperm analysis . (In other words, you'll need to go through fertility testing to discover the problem.) But if your partner experiences sexual dysfunction, this could be an infertility red flag. Weight Your weight plays a major role in your fertility. Being overweight —or underweight—can lead to trouble conceiving. In fact, obesity may be one of the most common causes of preventable subfertility. If you are obese, research has found that losing five to ten percent of your weight can jump start ovulation. Being over or underweight can also have an adverse effect on male fertility. Men with a BMI below 20 have been found to have lower sperm concentration and sperm counts, while obese men have been found to have lower levels of testosterone and lower sperm counts. If you are having difficulty with losing extra weight, talk to your doctor. Some hormonal causes of infertility can lead to weight problems. For example, PCOS increases your risk of obesity and happens to also be a cause of infertility. Miscarriage Rate Infertility is usually associated with the inability to get pregnant. However, a woman who experiences recurrent miscarriages may also need help getting pregnant. Miscarriage is not that uncommon. It occurs in 10 to 20 percent of pregnancies. Repeated miscarriage is not common. Only one percent of women will miscarry three pregnancies in a row. If you’ve had two successive miscarriages, talk to your doctor. Chronic Illnesses Chronic diseases, as well as their treatments, can lead to fertility problems. For example, diabetes, untreated celiac disease , periodontal disease , and hypothyroidism can increase your risk for infertility. Sometimes, treatments for chronic illnesses can negatively impact fertility. Insulin, antidepressants, and thyroid hormones may lead to irregular cycles. Tagamet ( cimetidine ), a medication used in treating peptic ulcers, and some hypertension medications can cause male factor infertility . These medications may cause problems with sperm production or their ability to fertilize the egg. Past Cancers Some cancer treatments can lead to fertility problems. If you or your partner has gone through cancer treatments, especially radiation therapy that was near the reproductive organs, seeking feedback from your doctor is recommended. History of STDs Sexually transmitted illnesses (or STDs/STIs) can be the cause of infertility . Infection and inflammation from chlamydia or gonorrhea can cause blockage of the fallopian tubes . This can make pregnancy either impossible or put a woman at risk for an ectopic pregnancy . The same applies for men. Left untreated, an infection can lead to scar tissue within the male reproductive tract, making semen transfer ineffective or even impossible. Because chlamydia and gonorrhea do not usually cause noticeable symptoms in women, it's important that you've been screened for these STDs. Many sexually transmitted infections are symptomless in women. You may feel fine while the disease silently wreaks havoc on your reproductive organs . If you have any symptoms of an STI, see your doctor right away, and if you're at risk of contracting an STI, get regular checks even if you are asymptomatic. Smoking and Alcohol Habits Just about everyone knows drinking and smoking while pregnant is a big no-no. But smoking and drinking while trying to get pregnant is also a problem. Smoking negatively affects sperm counts , sperm shape, and sperm movement, all important factors for conception. IVF treatment success has also been found to be poorer in male smokers, even when IVF with ICSI is used. (ICSI involves taking a single sperm and directly injecting it into an egg.) Smoking is also connected to erectile dysfunction, so dropping the habit may reverse some of the adverse effects. In women, smoking can speed up the process of ovarian aging , bringing on earlier menopause. The good news is that if you quit early enough, you may be able to reverse some of the damage. Heavy drinking can also lead to fertility problems, both for men and women. Most studies have found that a few drinks a week won't cause any harm, but excessive drinking has been linked to lower sperm counts, poor sperm movements, and irregular sperm shape. One study found that with every additional drink consumed per week, the IVF success rate decreased. Toxic Chemicals at Work Does your job involve close contact with toxic chemicals? If so, you may be at greater risk for infertility and decreased sperm health. Farmers, painters, varnishers, metal workers, and welders have all been found to be at risk for reduced fertility. If your job involves toxic chemical contact or high heat conditions, speak to your doctor. There may be more steps you can take to protect yourself. High Temperatures High temperatures are bad news for sperm. You've most likely heard of this in relation to the boxers versus briefs argument. The thinking was that boxers, being less restrictive and having more airflow, would lead to cooler testicular temperatures and healthier levels of fertility. The research isn't clear on whether boxers or briefs matter, although wearing extremely tight shorts or underwear, especially when made from a non-breathable fabric, may have an impact on sperm health. More sources of sperm-troubling heat include: Hot tubbing or long hot baths Sitting for prolonged periods of time with your legs together (like at a desk job or while driving long distances) Sitting with a laptop on your lap Heated car seats The heat damaging effects may have a longer lasting impact than you'd imagine, too. A very small study looked at men who attended a sauna twice a week, for 15 minutes, over a period of three months. When comparing to semen samples taken before the sauna visits, the researchers found decreases in sperm count and movement, as well as more DNA-damaged sperm. The men in the study were again evaluated three months and six months after they stopped attending the sauna. Sperm health wasn't completely regained until six months after the men stopped attending the sauna sessions. A Word From Verywell About 80 percent of couples will conceive within six months, and about 90 percent will be pregnant after a year, if they are having well-timed sexual intercourse . If you don’t get pregnant after one year of trying , you should see your doctor. If you’re 35 years old or older, then you should see your doctor after six months of trying. However, what if you have a possible sign of infertility before the one-year mark? What if you’re at risk for infertility? In that case, talk to your doctor now. Your doctor can run some basic fertility tests . If everything comes back normal, you can continue trying on your own for a while longer. However, if there is a problem, you will have caught it much sooner, and your odds of successful fertility treatment will be higher. Sources: Crosnoe LE, Kim ED. " Impact of age on male fertility ."

Most people know that a woman's fertility decreases as she gets older, but even during her most fertile (and otherwise healthy) years, lifestyle choices and external factors can affect a woman's chances of having a healthy baby.  "Women who want to increase their chances of getting pregnant often don't know the best things to do or what to watch out for," says Francisco Arredondo, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist in San Antonio, Texas. Here are some of factors that do (or don't) affect a woman's fertility, and what you can do about them if you are trying to conceive.  Watch the video: 5 Things to Know About Your Fertility    Advertisement                 2 of 16     Obesity  Carrying around extra pounds can affect hormone production and make it more difficult for a woman to get pregnant, says William Schlaff, MD, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia. "The more weight a woman gains over her healthy weight, the more she tends to experience decreased ovarian function," he says. And a 2009 study published in Fertility and Sterility found that women who were obese at age 18 were more likely to develop polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and have problems with infertility . PCOS is the most common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, and the leading cause of infertility.

That may be because women who have very low BMIs are deficient in leptin, the hormone that controls hunger and feelings of satiety. Having low leptin contributes to the absence of menstrual periods, according to a 2009 Harvard University study. "Maintaining a healthy body weightone that falls in the normal BMI range and that is reached through a healthy diet and moderate exerciseis one of the most important things a woman can do to increase her chances of getting pregnant," says Dr. Arredondo, who recently helped develop Conceivable, (free; iTunes ) a new app aimed at helping women increase their chances of getting pregnant. RELATED: Trying to Get Pregnant? 10 Proven Sperm Killers    Advertisement                           4 of 16  Getty Images    Getting older  When a woman reaches menopause, usually in her 40s or 50s, she no longer ovulates and is unable to get pregnant. But even in the decade or so before menopause officially occurs, she may experience fertility problems as her ovulation becomes less regular and her egg count declinesa time known as perimenopause. There's no official age when fertility begins to take a dive, but many doctors say that it often becomes increasingly difficult to get pregnant after age 35 . This age is different for every woman, though; some may go through perimenopause earlier, while others remain fertile through their 40s . That's why, says Dr. Schlaff, it's important for women of any age who are having trouble conceiving to see a specialist sooner rather than later.    Advertisement                           5 of 16  Getty Images    Your mother  Ask your mom how old she was when she went through menopause. If she started on the early side, then you probably will, too. "Women are born with a certain amount of eggs," says Dr. Arredondo, "and there are certain genetic factors that might make you born with more or less eggs than usual, or that may make you use those eggs faster than other average women." But you certainly aren't doomed to relive the same exact scenario your mom did. External factors that don't necessarily affect you could have impacted your mom.

Additionally, a 2015 Washington University study found that 15 common chemicals were associated with early menopause . These chemicals include nine PCBs (which have been banned since 1979 but still exist in older products), three pesticides, two forms of plastics called phthalates (often found in personal care items and beauty products like perfumes and nail polishes), and the toxin furan, a byproduct of industrial combustion.    Advertisement                           7 of 16  Getty Images    Smoking  Smoking can hurt a developing fetus, but lighting up can also drastically affect a woman's chances of getting pregnant in the first place. Smoking causes up to 13% of all infertility cases, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. (One 2014 study even found that a woman's smoking may affect the fertility of her sons.) Cigarette smoke disrupts hormones and damages DNA in both men and women, says Dr. Arredondo. "And it doesn't have to be heavy smoking, either," he says. "Even women who smoke moderately or who are exposed to secondhand smoke have disrupted endocrine function and can experience significant fertility issues." RELATED: Pregnant? Diet Changes to Make Right Now    Advertisement                           8 of 16  Getty Images    Alcohol  There's no evidence that a few drinks a week will affect your fertility, but doctors do caution against heavy drinking more than one drink a day for womenwhich has been linked to an increased risk for ovulation disorders. Plus, a 2004 Swedish study that tracked more than 7,000 women for 18 years found that the heaviest drinkers were more likely to have sought out fertility treatment . You probably already know you should stop drinking if you think you could be pregnant. Drinking during the early stages of pregnancy (and possibly even before conception) has been linked to premature births . As for whether it's safe to drink later in pregnancy, the jury's still out. Many doctors say a small amount of alcohol is OK, but the CDC and Surgeon General say it's best not to indulge since there is no proof that it's not harmful to the baby.    Advertisement                           9 of 16  Getty Images    Breastfeeding  It's a myth that you can't get pregnant while breastfeeding, but at the same time, it's true that women who are still nursing one child may have trouble conceiving another one. "It impacts ovulation," says Dr. Schlaff. "It's not impossibleso it shouldn't be used as your only birth control methodbut it is a decision that can have a negative impact on your fertility." Older moms who want to have another baby before they have to worry about age-related fertility decline should discuss how long to breastfeed with their doctor. Otherwise, it may be better to wait at least a year and a half before having another child, anyway: a 2014 University of Cincinnati College of Medicine study found that women who wait less than 18 months after having a child to conceive again are more likely to have a shorter pregnancy and preterm birth. RELATED: 10 Ways to Boost Your Odds of Getting Pregnant    Advertisement                           10 of 16  Getty Images    Extreme exercise  Working out helps keep you slim, strong, and full of energyall important when you're trying to get pregnant. Thing is, you can overdo it: "If you're exercising too much it can have a negative impact on ovulation," says Dr. Schlaff. It's not just an issue that affects very thin athletes, either. A 2012 study published in Fertility and Sterility found that normal-weight women who exercised vigorously for more than five hours a week had a harder time getting pregnant. The most obvious sign of a potential problem is a change in menstrual cycle, says Dr. Schlaff. "It doesn't have to go away completely, either," he says. "If you notice that it becomes lighter or shorter, you should talk to your doctor about the implications for your fertility and your health."    Advertisement                           11 of 16  Getty Images    Injectable birth control  Once you stop taking most forms of hormonal birth control, you can get pregnant within a month, says Dr. Schlaff. The one exception: Depo-Provera, the injectable birth control . Each Depo-Provera injection prevents pregnancy for 12 to 14 weeksand while some women do get pregnant in as little as one month after that protection wears off, it can take other women up to a year to conceive . Doctors recommend women stop using injectable birth control several months before they hope to get pregnant.

"People with significant thyroid disease are typically going to have some pretty obvious symptoms," says Dr. Schlaff, "but subclinical, undiagnosed hypothyroidism is certainly a recognized problem as well, and we know it can have subtle effects on fertility without a woman knowing it."

A 2011 study from the Nevada School of Medicine found that caffeine interferes with the muscle contractions that help eggs travel from the ovaries and through the fallopian tubes to the womb, while a 2012 Danish study revealed that drinking five or more cups of coffee a day may cut a woman's chances of successful in vitro fertilization by half. That said, other studies suggest caffeine plays no role in fertility. Either way, if you're struggling to conceive, it's worth taking a look at your caffeine intake and cutting back if you're drinking more than 200 milligrams a daythat's1 to 2 8-ounce cups of coffee.

Women with autoimmune disorders (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) may also have trouble conceiving, since their bodies may reject a fertilized egg or attack her partner's sperm. In many cases, though, women with these health conditions can still get pregnant and have healthy babies, says Dr. Arredondo. Working with a medical team to manage and improve symptoms, and seeing fertility help if needed, can increase the chances for success.

In fact, chlamydia can cause damage to the fallopian tubes without any other symptoms, and many women may not know they had the disease until they experience trouble getting pregnant. It's important to note, though, that vaginal infections (like yeast infections) have no effect on fertility, says Dr. Schlaff.

Researchers say this study doesn't indicate that stress alone is responsible for fertility problems, but they do suggest that women who have been trying to get pregnant for several months try adopting a stress management program. "Perceived stress can certainly alter hormone levels and ovulation," says Dr. Arredondo. "Stress itself is not bad, but when it is in excessand when we react to it in a negative wayit can have all kinds of impact on our health and our bodies."

Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).          Expand all  |  Collapse all      What is infertility?   Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after one year of trying (or six months if a woman is 35 or older). Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile.  Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps. To get pregnant:   A woman's body must release an egg from one of her ovaries (ovulation).  The egg must go through a fallopian tube toward the uterus (womb).  A man's sperm must join with (fertilize) the egg along the way.  The fertilized egg must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation).   Infertility can happen if there are problems with any of these steps.     Is infertility a common problem?   Yes. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).     Is infertility just a woman's problem?   No, infertility is not always a woman's problem. Both women and men can have problems that cause infertility. About one-third of infertility cases are caused by women's problems. Another one third of fertility problems are due to the man. The other cases are caused by a mixture of male and female problems or by unknown problems.     What causes infertility in men?   Infertility in men is most often caused by:   A problem called varicocele (VAIR-ih-koh-seel). This happens when the veins on a man's testicle(s) are too large. This heats the testicles. The heat can affect the number or shape of the sperm.  Other factors that cause a man to make too few sperm or none at all.  Movement of the sperm. This may be caused by the shape of the sperm. Sometimes injuries or other damage to the reproductive system block the sperm.   Sometimes a man is born with the problems that affect his sperm. Other times problems start later in life due to illness or injury. For example, cystic fibrosis often causes infertility in men.     What increases a man's risk of infertility?   A man's sperm can be changed by his overall health and lifestyle. Some things that may reduce the health or number of sperm include:   Heavy alcohol use  Drugs  Smoking cigarettes  Age  Environmental toxins, including pesticides and lead  Health problems such as mumps, serious conditions like kidney disease, or hormone problems  Medicines  Radiation treatment and chemotherapy for cancer      What causes infertility in women?   Most cases of female infertility are caused by problems with ovulation. Without ovulation, there are no eggs to be fertilized. Some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods.  Ovulation problems are often caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormone imbalance problem which can interfere with normal ovulation. PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is another cause of ovulation problems. POI occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. POI is not the same as early menopause.  Less common causes of fertility problems in women include:   Blocked fallopian tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease , endometriosis , or surgery for an ectopic pregnancy  Physical problems with the uterus  Uterine fibroids , which are non-cancerous clumps of tissue and muscle on the walls of the uterus.      What things increase a woman's risk of infertility?   Many things can change a woman's ability to have a baby. These include:   Age  Smoking  Excess alcohol use  Stress  Poor diet  Athletic training  Being overweight or underweight  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  Health problems that cause hormonal changes, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and primary ovarian insufficiency      How does age affect a woman's ability to have children?   Many women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 20 percent of women in the United States now have their first child after age 35. So age is a growing cause of fertility problems. About one-third of couples in which the woman is over 35 have fertility problems.  Aging decreases a woman's chances of having a baby in the following ways:   Her ovaries become less able to release eggs  She has a smaller number of eggs left  Her eggs are not as healthy  She is more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems  She is more likely to have a miscarriage      How long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors?   Most experts suggest at least one year. Women 35 or older should see their doctors after six months of trying. A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.  Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, women should talk to their doctors if they have:   Irregular periods or no menstrual periods  Very painful periods  Endometriosis  Pelvic inflammatory disease  More than one miscarriage   It is a good idea for any woman to talk to a doctor before trying to get pregnant. Doctors can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving.     How will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?   Doctors will do an infertility checkup. This involves a physical exam. The doctor will also ask for both partners' health and sexual histories. Sometimes this can find the problem. However, most of the time, the doctor will need to do more tests.  In men, doctors usually begin by testing the semen. They look at the number, shape, and movement of the sperm. Sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones.  In women, the first step is to find out if she is ovulating each month. There are a few ways to do this. A woman can track her ovulation at home by:   Writing down changes in her morning body temperature for several months  Writing down how her cervical mucus looks for several months  Using a home ovulation test kit (available at drug or grocery stores)   Doctors can also check ovulation with blood tests. Or they can do an ultrasound of the ovaries. If ovulation is normal, there are other fertility tests available.  Some common tests of fertility in women include:   Hysterosalpingography (HIS-tur-oh-sal-ping-GOGH-ru-fee): This is an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Doctors inject a special dye into the uterus through the vagina. This dye shows up in the x-ray. Doctors can then watch to see if the dye moves freely through the uterus and fallopian tubes. This can help them find physical blocks that may be causing infertility. Blocks in the system can keep the egg from moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. A block could also keep the sperm from reaching the egg.  Laparoscopy (lap-uh-ROS-kuh-pee): A minor surgery to see inside the abdomen. The doctor does this with a small tool with a light called a laparoscope (LAP-uh-roh-skohp). She or he makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. With the laparoscope, the doctor can check the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus for disease and physical problems. Doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.   Finding the cause of infertility can be a long and emotional process. It may take time to complete all the needed tests. So don't worry if the problem is not found right away.     How do doctors treat infertility?   Infertility can be treated with medicine , surgery, artificial insemination , or assisted reproductive technology . Many times these treatments are combined. In most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery.  Doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility based on:   Test results  How long the couple has been trying to get pregnant  The age of both the man and woman  The overall health of the partners  Preference of the partners   Doctors often treat  infertility in men in the following ways:   Sexual problems: Doctors can help men deal with impotence or premature ejaculation. Behavioral therapy and/or medicines can be used in these cases.  Too few sperm: Sometimes surgery can correct the cause of the problem. In other cases, doctors surgically remove sperm directly from the male reproductive tract. Antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count.  Sperm movement: Sometimes semen has no sperm because of a block in the man's system. In some cases, surgery can correct the problem.   In women, some physical problems can also be corrected with surgery.  A number of fertility medicines are used to treat women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. You should understand the possible dangers, benefits, and side effects.     What medicines are used to treat infertility in women?   Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include:   Clomiphene citrate ( Clomid ): This medicine causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. It is often used in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other problems with ovulation. This medicine is taken by mouth.  Human menopausal gonadotropin or hMG ( Repronex, Pergonal ): This medicine is often used for women who don't ovulate due to problems with their pituitary gland. hMG acts directly on the ovaries to stimulate ovulation. It is an injected medicine.  Follicle-stimulating hormone or FSH ( Gonal-F, Follistim ): FSH works much like hMG. It causes the ovaries to begin the process of ovulation. These medicines are usually injected.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analog: These medicines are often used for women who don't ovulate regularly each month. Women who ovulate before the egg is ready can also use these medicines. Gn-RH analogs act on the pituitary gland to change when the body ovulates. These medicines are usually injected or given with a nasal spray.  Metformin ( Glucophage ): Doctors use this medicine for women who have insulin resistance and/or PCOS. This drug helps lower the high levels of male hormones in women with these conditions. This helps the body to ovulate. Sometimes clomiphene citrate or FSH is combined with metformin. This medicine is usually taken by mouth.  Bromocriptine ( Parlodel ): This medicine is used for women with ovulation problems due to high levels of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that causes milk production.   Many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born too early (prematurely). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.     What is intrauterine insemination (IUI)?   Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is often called artificial insemination. In this procedure, the woman is injected with specially prepared sperm. Sometimes the woman is also treated with medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.  IUI is often used to treat:   Mild male factor infertility  Women who have problems with their cervical mucus  Couples with unexplained infertility      What is assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a group of different methods used to help infertile couples. ART works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body.     How often is assisted reproductive technology (ART) successful?   Success rates vary and depend on many factors. Some things that affect the success rate of ART include:   Age of the partners  Reason for infertility  Clinic  Type of ART  If the egg is fresh or frozen  If the embryo is fresh or frozen   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to a 2014 CDC report on ART , the average percentage of ART cycles that led to a live birth were:   39 percent in women under the age of 35  30 percent in women aged 35-37  21 percent in women aged 37-40  11 percent in women aged 41-42   ART can be expensive and time-consuming. But it has allowed many couples to have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common complication of ART is multiple fetuses. But this is a problem that can be prevented or minimized in several different ways.     What are the different types of assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Common methods of ART include:   In vitro fertilization (IVF) means fertilization outside of the body. IVF is the most effective ART. It is often used when a woman's fallopian tubes are blocked or when a man produces too few sperm. Doctors treat the woman with a drug that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Once mature, the eggs are removed from the woman. They are put in a dish in the lab along with the man's sperm for fertilization. After 3 to 5 days, healthy embryos are implanted in the woman's uterus.  Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or Tubal Embryo Transfer is similar to IVF. Fertilization occurs in the laboratory. Then the very young embryo is transferred to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus.  Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) involves transferring eggs and sperm into the woman's fallopian tube. So fertilization occurs in the woman's body. Few practices offer GIFT as an option.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is often used for couples in which there are serious problems with the sperm. Sometimes it is also used for older couples or for those with failed IVF attempts. In ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg. Then the embryo is transferred to the uterus or fallopian tube.   ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who can not produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm is sometimes used when the woman or man has a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby. An infertile woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either parent.  Surrogacy  Women with no eggs or unhealthy eggs might also want to consider surrogacy. A surrogate is a woman who agrees to become pregnant using the man's sperm and her own egg. The child will be genetically related to the surrogate and the male partner. After birth, the surrogate will give up the baby for adoption by the parents.  Gestational carrier  Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. This may also be an option for women who shouldn't become pregnant because of a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is fertilized by the man's sperm and the embryo is placed inside the carrier's uterus. The carrier will not be related to the baby and gives him or her to the parents at birth.  Recent research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that ART babies are two to four times more likely to have certain kinds of birth defects. These may include heart and digestive system problems, and cleft (divided into two pieces) lips or palate. Researchers don't know why this happens. The birth defects may not be due to the technology. Other factors, like the age of the parents, may be involved. More research is needed. The risk is relatively low, but parents should consider this when making the decision to use ART.

Expand all  |  Collapse all      What is infertility?   Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after one year of trying (or six months if a woman is 35 or older). Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile.  Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps. To get pregnant:   A woman's body must release an egg from one of her ovaries (ovulation).  The egg must go through a fallopian tube toward the uterus (womb).  A man's sperm must join with (fertilize) the egg along the way.  The fertilized egg must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation).   Infertility can happen if there are problems with any of these steps.     Is infertility a common problem?   Yes. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).     Is infertility just a woman's problem?   No, infertility is not always a woman's problem. Both women and men can have problems that cause infertility. About one-third of infertility cases are caused by women's problems. Another one third of fertility problems are due to the man. The other cases are caused by a mixture of male and female problems or by unknown problems.     What causes infertility in men?   Infertility in men is most often caused by:   A problem called varicocele (VAIR-ih-koh-seel). This happens when the veins on a man's testicle(s) are too large. This heats the testicles. The heat can affect the number or shape of the sperm.  Other factors that cause a man to make too few sperm or none at all.  Movement of the sperm. This may be caused by the shape of the sperm. Sometimes injuries or other damage to the reproductive system block the sperm.   Sometimes a man is born with the problems that affect his sperm. Other times problems start later in life due to illness or injury. For example, cystic fibrosis often causes infertility in men.     What increases a man's risk of infertility?   A man's sperm can be changed by his overall health and lifestyle. Some things that may reduce the health or number of sperm include:   Heavy alcohol use  Drugs  Smoking cigarettes  Age  Environmental toxins, including pesticides and lead  Health problems such as mumps, serious conditions like kidney disease, or hormone problems  Medicines  Radiation treatment and chemotherapy for cancer      What causes infertility in women?   Most cases of female infertility are caused by problems with ovulation. Without ovulation, there are no eggs to be fertilized. Some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods.  Ovulation problems are often caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormone imbalance problem which can interfere with normal ovulation. PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is another cause of ovulation problems. POI occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. POI is not the same as early menopause.  Less common causes of fertility problems in women include:   Blocked fallopian tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease , endometriosis , or surgery for an ectopic pregnancy  Physical problems with the uterus  Uterine fibroids , which are non-cancerous clumps of tissue and muscle on the walls of the uterus.      What things increase a woman's risk of infertility?   Many things can change a woman's ability to have a baby. These include:   Age  Smoking  Excess alcohol use  Stress  Poor diet  Athletic training  Being overweight or underweight  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  Health problems that cause hormonal changes, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and primary ovarian insufficiency      How does age affect a woman's ability to have children?   Many women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 20 percent of women in the United States now have their first child after age 35. So age is a growing cause of fertility problems. About one-third of couples in which the woman is over 35 have fertility problems.  Aging decreases a woman's chances of having a baby in the following ways:   Her ovaries become less able to release eggs  She has a smaller number of eggs left  Her eggs are not as healthy  She is more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems  She is more likely to have a miscarriage      How long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors?   Most experts suggest at least one year. Women 35 or older should see their doctors after six months of trying. A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.  Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, women should talk to their doctors if they have:   Irregular periods or no menstrual periods  Very painful periods  Endometriosis  Pelvic inflammatory disease  More than one miscarriage   It is a good idea for any woman to talk to a doctor before trying to get pregnant. Doctors can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving.     How will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?   Doctors will do an infertility checkup. This involves a physical exam. The doctor will also ask for both partners' health and sexual histories. Sometimes this can find the problem. However, most of the time, the doctor will need to do more tests.  In men, doctors usually begin by testing the semen. They look at the number, shape, and movement of the sperm. Sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones.  In women, the first step is to find out if she is ovulating each month. There are a few ways to do this. A woman can track her ovulation at home by:   Writing down changes in her morning body temperature for several months  Writing down how her cervical mucus looks for several months  Using a home ovulation test kit (available at drug or grocery stores)   Doctors can also check ovulation with blood tests. Or they can do an ultrasound of the ovaries. If ovulation is normal, there are other fertility tests available.  Some common tests of fertility in women include:   Hysterosalpingography (HIS-tur-oh-sal-ping-GOGH-ru-fee): This is an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Doctors inject a special dye into the uterus through the vagina. This dye shows up in the x-ray. Doctors can then watch to see if the dye moves freely through the uterus and fallopian tubes. This can help them find physical blocks that may be causing infertility. Blocks in the system can keep the egg from moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. A block could also keep the sperm from reaching the egg.  Laparoscopy (lap-uh-ROS-kuh-pee): A minor surgery to see inside the abdomen. The doctor does this with a small tool with a light called a laparoscope (LAP-uh-roh-skohp). She or he makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. With the laparoscope, the doctor can check the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus for disease and physical problems. Doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.   Finding the cause of infertility can be a long and emotional process. It may take time to complete all the needed tests. So don't worry if the problem is not found right away.     How do doctors treat infertility?   Infertility can be treated with medicine , surgery, artificial insemination , or assisted reproductive technology . Many times these treatments are combined. In most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery.  Doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility based on:   Test results  How long the couple has been trying to get pregnant  The age of both the man and woman  The overall health of the partners  Preference of the partners   Doctors often treat  infertility in men in the following ways:   Sexual problems: Doctors can help men deal with impotence or premature ejaculation. Behavioral therapy and/or medicines can be used in these cases.  Too few sperm: Sometimes surgery can correct the cause of the problem. In other cases, doctors surgically remove sperm directly from the male reproductive tract. Antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count.  Sperm movement: Sometimes semen has no sperm because of a block in the man's system. In some cases, surgery can correct the problem.   In women, some physical problems can also be corrected with surgery.  A number of fertility medicines are used to treat women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. You should understand the possible dangers, benefits, and side effects.     What medicines are used to treat infertility in women?   Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include:   Clomiphene citrate ( Clomid ): This medicine causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. It is often used in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other problems with ovulation. This medicine is taken by mouth.  Human menopausal gonadotropin or hMG ( Repronex, Pergonal ): This medicine is often used for women who don't ovulate due to problems with their pituitary gland. hMG acts directly on the ovaries to stimulate ovulation. It is an injected medicine.  Follicle-stimulating hormone or FSH ( Gonal-F, Follistim ): FSH works much like hMG. It causes the ovaries to begin the process of ovulation. These medicines are usually injected.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analog: These medicines are often used for women who don't ovulate regularly each month. Women who ovulate before the egg is ready can also use these medicines. Gn-RH analogs act on the pituitary gland to change when the body ovulates. These medicines are usually injected or given with a nasal spray.  Metformin ( Glucophage ): Doctors use this medicine for women who have insulin resistance and/or PCOS. This drug helps lower the high levels of male hormones in women with these conditions. This helps the body to ovulate. Sometimes clomiphene citrate or FSH is combined with metformin. This medicine is usually taken by mouth.  Bromocriptine ( Parlodel ): This medicine is used for women with ovulation problems due to high levels of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that causes milk production.   Many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born too early (prematurely). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.     What is intrauterine insemination (IUI)?   Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is often called artificial insemination. In this procedure, the woman is injected with specially prepared sperm. Sometimes the woman is also treated with medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.  IUI is often used to treat:   Mild male factor infertility  Women who have problems with their cervical mucus  Couples with unexplained infertility      What is assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a group of different methods used to help infertile couples. ART works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body.     How often is assisted reproductive technology (ART) successful?   Success rates vary and depend on many factors. Some things that affect the success rate of ART include:   Age of the partners  Reason for infertility  Clinic  Type of ART  If the egg is fresh or frozen  If the embryo is fresh or frozen   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to a 2014 CDC report on ART , the average percentage of ART cycles that led to a live birth were:   39 percent in women under the age of 35  30 percent in women aged 35-37  21 percent in women aged 37-40  11 percent in women aged 41-42   ART can be expensive and time-consuming. But it has allowed many couples to have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common complication of ART is multiple fetuses. But this is a problem that can be prevented or minimized in several different ways.     What are the different types of assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Common methods of ART include:   In vitro fertilization (IVF) means fertilization outside of the body. IVF is the most effective ART. It is often used when a woman's fallopian tubes are blocked or when a man produces too few sperm. Doctors treat the woman with a drug that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Once mature, the eggs are removed from the woman. They are put in a dish in the lab along with the man's sperm for fertilization. After 3 to 5 days, healthy embryos are implanted in the woman's uterus.  Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or Tubal Embryo Transfer is similar to IVF. Fertilization occurs in the laboratory. Then the very young embryo is transferred to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus.  Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) involves transferring eggs and sperm into the woman's fallopian tube. So fertilization occurs in the woman's body. Few practices offer GIFT as an option.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is often used for couples in which there are serious problems with the sperm. Sometimes it is also used for older couples or for those with failed IVF attempts. In ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg. Then the embryo is transferred to the uterus or fallopian tube.   ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who can not produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm is sometimes used when the woman or man has a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby. An infertile woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either parent.  Surrogacy  Women with no eggs or unhealthy eggs might also want to consider surrogacy. A surrogate is a woman who agrees to become pregnant using the man's sperm and her own egg. The child will be genetically related to the surrogate and the male partner. After birth, the surrogate will give up the baby for adoption by the parents.  Gestational carrier  Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. This may also be an option for women who shouldn't become pregnant because of a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is fertilized by the man's sperm and the embryo is placed inside the carrier's uterus. The carrier will not be related to the baby and gives him or her to the parents at birth.  Recent research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that ART babies are two to four times more likely to have certain kinds of birth defects. These may include heart and digestive system problems, and cleft (divided into two pieces) lips or palate. Researchers don't know why this happens. The birth defects may not be due to the technology. Other factors, like the age of the parents, may be involved. More research is needed. The risk is relatively low, but parents should consider this when making the decision to use ART.

Female infertility, male infertility or a combination of the two affects millions of couples in the United States. An estimated 10 to 18 percent of couples have trouble getting pregnant or having a successful delivery.  Infertility results from female factors about one-third of the time and male factors about one-third of the time. The cause is either unknown or a combination of male and female factors in the remaining cases.  Female infertility causes can be difficult to diagnose. There are many available treatments, which will depend on the cause of infertility. Many infertile couples will go on to conceive a child without treatment. After trying to get pregnant for two years, about 95 percent of couples successfully conceive.      Symptoms The main symptom of infertility is the inability to get pregnant. A menstrual cycle that's too long (35 days or more), too short (less than 21 days), irregular or absent can mean that you're not ovulating. There may be no other outward signs or symptoms.  When to see a doctor  When to seek help sometimes depends on your age:   Up to age 35, most doctors recommend trying to get pregnant for at least a year before testing or treatment.  If you're between 35 and 40, discuss your concerns with your doctor after six months of trying.  If you're older than 40, your doctor may want to begin testing or treatment right away.   Your doctor may also want to begin testing or treatment right away if you or your partner has known fertility problems, or if you have a history of irregular or painful periods, pelvic inflammatory disease, repeated miscarriages, prior cancer treatment, or endometriosis.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes    Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.        Fertilization and implantation Fertilization and implantation During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote. Then the zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula. Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst. The blastocyst then burrows into the uterine lining — a process called implantation.     Each of these factors is essential to become pregnant:   You need to ovulate. To get pregnant, your ovaries must produce and release an egg, a process known as ovulation. Your doctor can help evaluate your menstrual cycles and confirm ovulation.  Your partner needs sperm. For most couples, this isn't a problem unless your partner has a history of illness or surgery. Your doctor can run some simple tests to evaluate the health of your partner's sperm.  You need to have regular intercourse. You need to have regular sexual intercourse during your fertile time. Your doctor can help you better understand when you're most fertile.  You need to have open fallopian tubes and a normal uterus. The egg and sperm meet in the fallopian tubes, and the embryo needs a healthy uterus in which to grow.   For pregnancy to occur, every step of the human reproduction process has to happen correctly. The steps in this process are:   One of the two ovaries releases a mature egg.  The egg is picked up by the fallopian tube.  Sperm swim up the cervix, through the uterus and into the fallopian tube to reach the egg for fertilization.  The fertilized egg travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus.  The fertilized egg implants and grows in the uterus.   In women, a number of factors can disrupt this process at any step. Female infertility is caused by one or more of the factors below.            Transcript Ovulation is the release of an egg from one of the ovaries. It often happens about midway through the menstrual cycle, although the exact timing may vary.  In preparation for ovulation, the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, thickens.  The pituitary gland in the brain stimulates one of the ovaries to release an egg.  The wall of the ovarian follicle ruptures at the surface of the ovary. The egg is released.  Finger-like structures called fimbriae sweep the egg into the neighboring fallopian tube.  The egg travels through the fallopian tube, propelled in part by contractions in the fallopian tube walls.  Here in the fallopian tube, the egg may be fertilized by a sperm.  If the egg is fertilized, the egg and sperm unite to form a one-celled entity called a zygote.  As the zygote travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, it begins dividing rapidly to form a cluster of cells resembling a tiny raspberry.  When the zygote reaches the uterus, it implants in the lining of the uterus and pregnancy begins.  If the egg isn't fertilized, it's simply reabsorbed by the body — perhaps before it even reaches the uterus. About two weeks later, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina. This is known as menstruation.    Ovulation disorders  Ovulation disorders, meaning you ovulate infrequently or not at all, account for infertility in about 1 in 4 infertile couples. Problems with the regulation of reproductive hormones by the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, or problems in the ovary, can cause ovulation disorders.   Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ).  PCOS causes a hormone imbalance, which affects ovulation. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and obesity, abnormal hair growth on the face or body, and acne. It's the most common cause of female infertility.  Hypothalamic dysfunction. Two hormones produced by the pituitary gland are responsible for stimulating ovulation each month — ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ). Excess physical or emotional stress, a very high or very low body weight, or a recent substantial weight gain or loss can disrupt production of these hormones and affect ovulation. Irregular or absent periods are the most common signs.  Premature ovarian failure. Also called primary ovarian insufficiency, this disorder is usually caused by an autoimmune response or by premature loss of eggs from your ovary (possibly from genetics or chemotherapy). The ovary no longer produces eggs, and it lowers estrogen production in women under the age of 40.  Too much prolactin. The pituitary gland may cause excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia), which reduces estrogen production and may cause infertility. Usually related to a pituitary gland problem, this can also be caused by medications you're taking for another disease.   Damage to fallopian tubes (tubal infertility)  Damaged or blocked fallopian tubes keep sperm from getting to the egg or block the passage of the fertilized egg into the uterus. Causes of fallopian tube damage or blockage can include:   Pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes due to chlamydia, gonorrhea or other sexually transmitted infections  Previous surgery in the abdomen or pelvis, including surgery for ectopic pregnancy, in which a fertilized egg implants and develops in a fallopian tube instead of the uterus  Pelvic tuberculosis, a major cause of tubal infertility worldwide, although uncommon in the United States   Endometriosis  Endometriosis occurs when tissue that normally grows in the uterus implants and grows in other locations. This extra tissue growth — and the surgical removal of it — can cause scarring, which may block fallopian tubes and keep an egg and sperm from uniting.  Endometriosis can also affect the lining of the uterus, disrupting implantation of the fertilized egg. The condition also seems to affect fertility in less-direct ways, such as damage to the sperm or egg.  Uterine or cervical causes  Several uterine or cervical causes can impact fertility by interfering with implantation or increasing the likelihood of a miscarriage:   Benign polyps or tumors (fibroids or myomas) are common in the uterus. Some can block fallopian tubes or interfere with implantation, affecting fertility. However, many women who have fibroids or polyps do become pregnant.  Endometriosis scarring or inflammation within the uterus can disrupt implantation.  Uterine abnormalities present from birth, such as an abnormally shaped uterus, can cause problems becoming or remaining pregnant.  Cervical stenosis, a narrowing of the cervix, can be caused by an inherited malformation or damage to the cervix.  Sometimes the cervix can't produce the best type of mucus to allow the sperm to travel through the cervix into the uterus.   Unexplained infertility  Sometimes, the cause of infertility is never found. A combination of several minor factors in both partners could cause unexplained fertility problems. Although it's frustrating to get no specific answer, this problem may correct itself with time. But, you shouldn't delay treatment for infertility.  Risk factors Certain factors may put you at higher risk of infertility, including:   Age. The quality and quantity of a woman's eggs begin to decline with increasing age. In the mid-30s, the rate of follicle loss speeds, resulting in fewer and poorer quality eggs. This makes conception more difficult, and increases the risk of miscarriage.  Smoking. Besides damaging your cervix and fallopian tubes, smoking increases your risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. It's also thought to age your ovaries and deplete your eggs prematurely. Stop smoking before beginning fertility treatment.  Weight. Being overweight or significantly underweight may affect normal ovulation. Getting to a healthy body mass index ( BMI ) may increase the frequency of ovulation and likelihood of pregnancy.  Sexual history. Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can damage the fallopian tubes. Having unprotected intercourse with multiple partners increases your risk of a sexually transmitted infection that may cause fertility problems later.  Alcohol. Stick to moderate alcohol consumption of no more than one alcoholic drink per day.   Prevention If you're a woman thinking about getting pregnant soon or in the future, you may improve your chances of having normal fertility if you:   Maintain a normal weight. Overweight and underweight women are at increased risk of ovulation disorders. If you need to lose weight, exercise moderately. Strenuous, intense exercise of more than five hours a week has been associated with decreased ovulation.  Quit smoking. Tobacco has multiple negative effects on fertility, not to mention your general health and the health of a fetus. If you smoke and are considering pregnancy, quit now.  Avoid alcohol. Heavy alcohol use may lead to decreased fertility. And any alcohol use can affect the health of a developing fetus. If you're planning to become pregnant, avoid alcohol, and don't drink alcohol while you're pregnant.  Reduce stress. Some studies have shown that couples experiencing psychological stress had poorer results with infertility treatment. If you can, find a way to reduce stress in your life before trying to become pregnant.  Limit caffeine. Research suggests that limiting caffeine intake to less than 200 milligrams a day shouldn't affect your ability to get pregnant. That's about one to two cups of 6 to 8 ounces of coffee per day.

Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).          Expand all  |  Collapse all      What is infertility?   Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after one year of trying (or six months if a woman is 35 or older). Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile.  Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps. To get pregnant:   A woman's body must release an egg from one of her ovaries (ovulation).  The egg must go through a fallopian tube toward the uterus (womb).  A man's sperm must join with (fertilize) the egg along the way.  The fertilized egg must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation).   Infertility can happen if there are problems with any of these steps.     Is infertility a common problem?   Yes. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).     Is infertility just a woman's problem?   No, infertility is not always a woman's problem. Both women and men can have problems that cause infertility. About one-third of infertility cases are caused by women's problems. Another one third of fertility problems are due to the man. The other cases are caused by a mixture of male and female problems or by unknown problems.     What causes infertility in men?   Infertility in men is most often caused by:   A problem called varicocele (VAIR-ih-koh-seel). This happens when the veins on a man's testicle(s) are too large. This heats the testicles. The heat can affect the number or shape of the sperm.  Other factors that cause a man to make too few sperm or none at all.  Movement of the sperm. This may be caused by the shape of the sperm. Sometimes injuries or other damage to the reproductive system block the sperm.   Sometimes a man is born with the problems that affect his sperm. Other times problems start later in life due to illness or injury. For example, cystic fibrosis often causes infertility in men.     What increases a man's risk of infertility?   A man's sperm can be changed by his overall health and lifestyle. Some things that may reduce the health or number of sperm include:   Heavy alcohol use  Drugs  Smoking cigarettes  Age  Environmental toxins, including pesticides and lead  Health problems such as mumps, serious conditions like kidney disease, or hormone problems  Medicines  Radiation treatment and chemotherapy for cancer      What causes infertility in women?   Most cases of female infertility are caused by problems with ovulation. Without ovulation, there are no eggs to be fertilized. Some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods.  Ovulation problems are often caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormone imbalance problem which can interfere with normal ovulation. PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is another cause of ovulation problems. POI occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. POI is not the same as early menopause.  Less common causes of fertility problems in women include:   Blocked fallopian tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease , endometriosis , or surgery for an ectopic pregnancy  Physical problems with the uterus  Uterine fibroids , which are non-cancerous clumps of tissue and muscle on the walls of the uterus.      What things increase a woman's risk of infertility?   Many things can change a woman's ability to have a baby. These include:   Age  Smoking  Excess alcohol use  Stress  Poor diet  Athletic training  Being overweight or underweight  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  Health problems that cause hormonal changes, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and primary ovarian insufficiency      How does age affect a woman's ability to have children?   Many women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 20 percent of women in the United States now have their first child after age 35. So age is a growing cause of fertility problems. About one-third of couples in which the woman is over 35 have fertility problems.  Aging decreases a woman's chances of having a baby in the following ways:   Her ovaries become less able to release eggs  She has a smaller number of eggs left  Her eggs are not as healthy  She is more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems  She is more likely to have a miscarriage      How long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors?   Most experts suggest at least one year. Women 35 or older should see their doctors after six months of trying. A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.  Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, women should talk to their doctors if they have:   Irregular periods or no menstrual periods  Very painful periods  Endometriosis  Pelvic inflammatory disease  More than one miscarriage   It is a good idea for any woman to talk to a doctor before trying to get pregnant. Doctors can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving.     How will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?   Doctors will do an infertility checkup. This involves a physical exam. The doctor will also ask for both partners' health and sexual histories. Sometimes this can find the problem. However, most of the time, the doctor will need to do more tests.  In men, doctors usually begin by testing the semen. They look at the number, shape, and movement of the sperm. Sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones.  In women, the first step is to find out if she is ovulating each month. There are a few ways to do this. A woman can track her ovulation at home by:   Writing down changes in her morning body temperature for several months  Writing down how her cervical mucus looks for several months  Using a home ovulation test kit (available at drug or grocery stores)   Doctors can also check ovulation with blood tests. Or they can do an ultrasound of the ovaries. If ovulation is normal, there are other fertility tests available.  Some common tests of fertility in women include:   Hysterosalpingography (HIS-tur-oh-sal-ping-GOGH-ru-fee): This is an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Doctors inject a special dye into the uterus through the vagina. This dye shows up in the x-ray. Doctors can then watch to see if the dye moves freely through the uterus and fallopian tubes. This can help them find physical blocks that may be causing infertility. Blocks in the system can keep the egg from moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. A block could also keep the sperm from reaching the egg.  Laparoscopy (lap-uh-ROS-kuh-pee): A minor surgery to see inside the abdomen. The doctor does this with a small tool with a light called a laparoscope (LAP-uh-roh-skohp). She or he makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. With the laparoscope, the doctor can check the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus for disease and physical problems. Doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.   Finding the cause of infertility can be a long and emotional process. It may take time to complete all the needed tests. So don't worry if the problem is not found right away.     How do doctors treat infertility?   Infertility can be treated with medicine , surgery, artificial insemination , or assisted reproductive technology . Many times these treatments are combined. In most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery.  Doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility based on:   Test results  How long the couple has been trying to get pregnant  The age of both the man and woman  The overall health of the partners  Preference of the partners   Doctors often treat  infertility in men in the following ways:   Sexual problems: Doctors can help men deal with impotence or premature ejaculation. Behavioral therapy and/or medicines can be used in these cases.  Too few sperm: Sometimes surgery can correct the cause of the problem. In other cases, doctors surgically remove sperm directly from the male reproductive tract. Antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count.  Sperm movement: Sometimes semen has no sperm because of a block in the man's system. In some cases, surgery can correct the problem.   In women, some physical problems can also be corrected with surgery.  A number of fertility medicines are used to treat women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. You should understand the possible dangers, benefits, and side effects.     What medicines are used to treat infertility in women?   Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include:   Clomiphene citrate ( Clomid ): This medicine causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. It is often used in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other problems with ovulation. This medicine is taken by mouth.  Human menopausal gonadotropin or hMG ( Repronex, Pergonal ): This medicine is often used for women who don't ovulate due to problems with their pituitary gland. hMG acts directly on the ovaries to stimulate ovulation. It is an injected medicine.  Follicle-stimulating hormone or FSH ( Gonal-F, Follistim ): FSH works much like hMG. It causes the ovaries to begin the process of ovulation. These medicines are usually injected.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analog: These medicines are often used for women who don't ovulate regularly each month. Women who ovulate before the egg is ready can also use these medicines. Gn-RH analogs act on the pituitary gland to change when the body ovulates. These medicines are usually injected or given with a nasal spray.  Metformin ( Glucophage ): Doctors use this medicine for women who have insulin resistance and/or PCOS. This drug helps lower the high levels of male hormones in women with these conditions. This helps the body to ovulate. Sometimes clomiphene citrate or FSH is combined with metformin. This medicine is usually taken by mouth.  Bromocriptine ( Parlodel ): This medicine is used for women with ovulation problems due to high levels of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that causes milk production.   Many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born too early (prematurely). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.     What is intrauterine insemination (IUI)?   Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is often called artificial insemination. In this procedure, the woman is injected with specially prepared sperm. Sometimes the woman is also treated with medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.  IUI is often used to treat:   Mild male factor infertility  Women who have problems with their cervical mucus  Couples with unexplained infertility      What is assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a group of different methods used to help infertile couples. ART works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body.     How often is assisted reproductive technology (ART) successful?   Success rates vary and depend on many factors. Some things that affect the success rate of ART include:   Age of the partners  Reason for infertility  Clinic  Type of ART  If the egg is fresh or frozen  If the embryo is fresh or frozen   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to a 2014 CDC report on ART , the average percentage of ART cycles that led to a live birth were:   39 percent in women under the age of 35  30 percent in women aged 35-37  21 percent in women aged 37-40  11 percent in women aged 41-42   ART can be expensive and time-consuming. But it has allowed many couples to have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common complication of ART is multiple fetuses. But this is a problem that can be prevented or minimized in several different ways.     What are the different types of assisted reproductive technology (ART)?   Common methods of ART include:   In vitro fertilization (IVF) means fertilization outside of the body. IVF is the most effective ART. It is often used when a woman's fallopian tubes are blocked or when a man produces too few sperm. Doctors treat the woman with a drug that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Once mature, the eggs are removed from the woman. They are put in a dish in the lab along with the man's sperm for fertilization. After 3 to 5 days, healthy embryos are implanted in the woman's uterus.  Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or Tubal Embryo Transfer is similar to IVF. Fertilization occurs in the laboratory. Then the very young embryo is transferred to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus.  Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) involves transferring eggs and sperm into the woman's fallopian tube. So fertilization occurs in the woman's body. Few practices offer GIFT as an option.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is often used for couples in which there are serious problems with the sperm. Sometimes it is also used for older couples or for those with failed IVF attempts. In ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg. Then the embryo is transferred to the uterus or fallopian tube.   ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who can not produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm is sometimes used when the woman or man has a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby. An infertile woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either parent.  Surrogacy  Women with no eggs or unhealthy eggs might also want to consider surrogacy. A surrogate is a woman who agrees to become pregnant using the man's sperm and her own egg. The child will be genetically related to the surrogate and the male partner. After birth, the surrogate will give up the baby for adoption by the parents.  Gestational carrier  Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. This may also be an option for women who shouldn't become pregnant because of a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is fertilized by the man's sperm and the embryo is placed inside the carrier's uterus. The carrier will not be related to the baby and gives him or her to the parents at birth.  Recent research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that ART babies are two to four times more likely to have certain kinds of birth defects. These may include heart and digestive system problems, and cleft (divided into two pieces) lips or palate. Researchers don't know why this happens. The birth defects may not be due to the technology. Other factors, like the age of the parents, may be involved. More research is needed. The risk is relatively low, but parents should consider this when making the decision to use ART.

About one-third of these cases are due to female fertility problems, one-third to male fertility problems, and the rest to factors involving both partners or to unexplained causes. If you've had regular, unprotected sex for more than a year without conceiving (or six months if you're older than 35), see your doctor . About 65 percent of couples that get treatment for a fertility problem are eventually able to have a successful pregnancy, according to Resolve, the national infertility association. The success rates below are based on averages gathered from large groups of patients. Each couple is unique, so think of the success rate for any treatment as a general snapshot, not a prediction of your chances of having a baby. Read on to learn more about female infertility and available fertility treatments .  Ovulation problems An ovulation problem occurs when eggs don't mature in the ovaries or when the ovaries fail to release a mature egg. This is sometimes known as premature ovarian failure . Ovulation problems are common in women with infertility. Possible symptoms: Absent or infrequent periods , unusually light or heavy menstrual bleeding, or lack of such premenstrual symptoms as bloating or breast tenderness. Possible solutions: Managing body weight if it's too low or too high, taking fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination ), and having in vitro fertilization (IVF) . Success rates: Thirty to 40 percent of women taking clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation become pregnant by the third treatment cycle. When fertility drugs to increase egg production are combined with artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 10 and 20 percent per treatment cycle. The percentage of IVF treatment cycles resulting in a live birth (in which one or more babies are born) is about: 40 percent for women age 34 and under 31 percent for women age 35 to 37 21 percent for women age 38 to 40 11 percent for women age 41 to 42 5 percent for women age 43 and over  Endometriosis Endometriosis is a condition that occurs when tissue normally found in the lining of the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows outside the uterus, usually in the abdomen or pelvis. Possible symptoms: Some women have no symptoms, while others have painful periods or intercourse, heavy bleeding or unusual spotting, and general pelvic pain. Possible solutions: Surgery to remove endometrial tissue or open blocked fallopian tubes, fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination), and IVF. Success rates: A large study found that 30 percent of women with infertility related to early stage endometriosis conceived naturally within three years after having laparoscopic surgery to remove endometrial tissue. When women with early stage endometriosis are treated with fertility drugs and artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 15 percent per treatment cycle. The live birth rate per treatment cycle for women with endometriosis who undergo IVF ranges from 2 to 42 percent, depending on the woman's age.  Poor egg quality The quality and number of eggs the ovaries produce – naturally or with fertility treatment – declines significantly after age 35. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs, IVF using your own eggs, IVF with donor eggs or donor embryos . Success rates: Women who have IVF using donor eggs have an approximate 55 percent chance of having a baby per IVF cycle.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which small follicles in the ovaries don't develop into the larger, mature follicles that release eggs. It's also characterized by hormone imbalances and unpredictable ovulation patterns . Possible symptoms:  irregular periods , excessive hair growth, acne, and obesity. Possible solutions: Lifestyle modifications (like diet and exercise), clomiphene citrate, injected fertility drugs, ovarian drilling (a surgical procedure that can trigger ovulation), and IVF. In women with glucose intolerance, the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage) can also help restore regular ovulation. Success rates: Many overweight patients who lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight start ovulating regularly. For women with PCOS who take clomiphene citrate, the pregnancy rate per treatment cycle is about 18 percent. For women treated with ovarian drilling, about 50 percent get pregnant within one year.  Tubal factors Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes prevent sperm from getting to your egg and also prevent the fertilized egg from getting to your uterus. Leading causes of tube problems include pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted infections (such as chlamydia), and previous sterilization surgery. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Surgery to open the tubes. If surgery fails, or if the tubes are too damaged to repair, they may be removed before having IVF in order to improve your chances of pregnancy. Success rates: Conception rates after surgery vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the tube blockage and the amount of postoperative scar tissue that develops. Couples with tubal factor infertility who try IVF have a 22 percent chance on average of having a baby per IVF treatment cycle. This depends on the woman's age, extent of tubal disease or whether the tubes have been removed, and several other factors.  Unexplained fertility problems Your doctor may diagnose an unexplained fertility problem if there's no obvious reason for your infertility (meaning all test results are normal). Some experts believe subtle differences in the way the reproductive system works may cause this type of infertility. This can include differences in follicle development, sperm function, or the fertilization process. Experts also theorize that lifestyle factors – such as being significantly underweight or overweight, regularly consuming too much caffeine or alcohol, and smoking – may be contributing factors as well. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination) or IVF. Success rates: For couples with unexplained infertility, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 26 percent per treatment cycle when fertility drugs are used in combination with artificial insemination. With IVF, the live birth rate is about 30 percent per treatment cycle, but that figure varies depending on age.     Show sources       Hide sources       SART. 2013. Fertility data table.

About one-third of these cases are due to female fertility problems, one-third to male fertility problems, and the rest to factors involving both partners or to unexplained causes. If you've had regular, unprotected sex for more than a year without conceiving (or six months if you're older than 35), see your doctor . About 65 percent of couples that get treatment for a fertility problem are eventually able to have a successful pregnancy, according to Resolve, the national infertility association. The success rates below are based on averages gathered from large groups of patients. Each couple is unique, so think of the success rate for any treatment as a general snapshot, not a prediction of your chances of having a baby. Read on to learn more about female infertility and available fertility treatments .  Ovulation problems An ovulation problem occurs when eggs don't mature in the ovaries or when the ovaries fail to release a mature egg. This is sometimes known as premature ovarian failure . Ovulation problems are common in women with infertility. Possible symptoms: Absent or infrequent periods , unusually light or heavy menstrual bleeding, or lack of such premenstrual symptoms as bloating or breast tenderness. Possible solutions: Managing body weight if it's too low or too high, taking fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination ), and having in vitro fertilization (IVF) . Success rates: Thirty to 40 percent of women taking clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation become pregnant by the third treatment cycle. When fertility drugs to increase egg production are combined with artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 10 and 20 percent per treatment cycle. The percentage of IVF treatment cycles resulting in a live birth (in which one or more babies are born) is about: 40 percent for women age 34 and under 31 percent for women age 35 to 37 21 percent for women age 38 to 40 11 percent for women age 41 to 42 5 percent for women age 43 and over  Endometriosis Endometriosis is a condition that occurs when tissue normally found in the lining of the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows outside the uterus, usually in the abdomen or pelvis. Possible symptoms: Some women have no symptoms, while others have painful periods or intercourse, heavy bleeding or unusual spotting, and general pelvic pain. Possible solutions: Surgery to remove endometrial tissue or open blocked fallopian tubes, fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination), and IVF. Success rates: A large study found that 30 percent of women with infertility related to early stage endometriosis conceived naturally within three years after having laparoscopic surgery to remove endometrial tissue. When women with early stage endometriosis are treated with fertility drugs and artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 15 percent per treatment cycle. The live birth rate per treatment cycle for women with endometriosis who undergo IVF ranges from 2 to 42 percent, depending on the woman's age.  Poor egg quality The quality and number of eggs the ovaries produce – naturally or with fertility treatment – declines significantly after age 35. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs, IVF using your own eggs, IVF with donor eggs or donor embryos . Success rates: Women who have IVF using donor eggs have an approximate 55 percent chance of having a baby per IVF cycle.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which small follicles in the ovaries don't develop into the larger, mature follicles that release eggs. It's also characterized by hormone imbalances and unpredictable ovulation patterns . Possible symptoms:  irregular periods , excessive hair growth, acne, and obesity. Possible solutions: Lifestyle modifications (like diet and exercise), clomiphene citrate, injected fertility drugs, ovarian drilling (a surgical procedure that can trigger ovulation), and IVF. In women with glucose intolerance, the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage) can also help restore regular ovulation. Success rates: Many overweight patients who lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight start ovulating regularly. For women with PCOS who take clomiphene citrate, the pregnancy rate per treatment cycle is about 18 percent. For women treated with ovarian drilling, about 50 percent get pregnant within one year.  Tubal factors Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes prevent sperm from getting to your egg and also prevent the fertilized egg from getting to your uterus. Leading causes of tube problems include pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted infections (such as chlamydia), and previous sterilization surgery. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Surgery to open the tubes. If surgery fails, or if the tubes are too damaged to repair, they may be removed before having IVF in order to improve your chances of pregnancy. Success rates: Conception rates after surgery vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the tube blockage and the amount of postoperative scar tissue that develops. Couples with tubal factor infertility who try IVF have a 22 percent chance on average of having a baby per IVF treatment cycle. This depends on the woman's age, extent of tubal disease or whether the tubes have been removed, and several other factors.  Unexplained fertility problems Your doctor may diagnose an unexplained fertility problem if there's no obvious reason for your infertility (meaning all test results are normal). Some experts believe subtle differences in the way the reproductive system works may cause this type of infertility. This can include differences in follicle development, sperm function, or the fertilization process. Experts also theorize that lifestyle factors – such as being significantly underweight or overweight, regularly consuming too much caffeine or alcohol, and smoking – may be contributing factors as well. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination) or IVF. Success rates: For couples with unexplained infertility, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 26 percent per treatment cycle when fertility drugs are used in combination with artificial insemination. With IVF, the live birth rate is about 30 percent per treatment cycle, but that figure varies depending on age.     Show sources       Hide sources       SART. 2013. Fertility data table.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which small follicles in the ovaries don't develop into the larger, mature follicles that release eggs. It's also characterized by hormone imbalances and unpredictable ovulation patterns . Possible symptoms:  irregular periods , excessive hair growth, acne, and obesity. Possible solutions: Lifestyle modifications (like diet and exercise), clomiphene citrate, injected fertility drugs, ovarian drilling (a surgical procedure that can trigger ovulation), and IVF. In women with glucose intolerance, the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage) can also help restore regular ovulation. Success rates: Many overweight patients who lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight start ovulating regularly. For women with PCOS who take clomiphene citrate, the pregnancy rate per treatment cycle is about 18 percent. For women treated with ovarian drilling, about 50 percent get pregnant within one year.  Tubal factors Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes prevent sperm from getting to your egg and also prevent the fertilized egg from getting to your uterus. Leading causes of tube problems include pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted infections (such as chlamydia), and previous sterilization surgery. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Surgery to open the tubes. If surgery fails, or if the tubes are too damaged to repair, they may be removed before having IVF in order to improve your chances of pregnancy. Success rates: Conception rates after surgery vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the tube blockage and the amount of postoperative scar tissue that develops. Couples with tubal factor infertility who try IVF have a 22 percent chance on average of having a baby per IVF treatment cycle. This depends on the woman's age, extent of tubal disease or whether the tubes have been removed, and several other factors.  Unexplained fertility problems Your doctor may diagnose an unexplained fertility problem if there's no obvious reason for your infertility (meaning all test results are normal). Some experts believe subtle differences in the way the reproductive system works may cause this type of infertility. This can include differences in follicle development, sperm function, or the fertilization process. Experts also theorize that lifestyle factors – such as being significantly underweight or overweight, regularly consuming too much caffeine or alcohol, and smoking – may be contributing factors as well. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination) or IVF. Success rates: For couples with unexplained infertility, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 26 percent per treatment cycle when fertility drugs are used in combination with artificial insemination. With IVF, the live birth rate is about 30 percent per treatment cycle, but that figure varies depending on age.     Show sources       Hide sources       SART. 2013. Fertility data table.

About one-third of these cases are due to female fertility problems, one-third to male fertility problems, and the rest to factors involving both partners or to unexplained causes. If you've had regular, unprotected sex for more than a year without conceiving (or six months if you're older than 35), see your doctor . About 65 percent of couples that get treatment for a fertility problem are eventually able to have a successful pregnancy, according to Resolve, the national infertility association. The success rates below are based on averages gathered from large groups of patients. Each couple is unique, so think of the success rate for any treatment as a general snapshot, not a prediction of your chances of having a baby. Read on to learn more about female infertility and available fertility treatments .  Ovulation problems An ovulation problem occurs when eggs don't mature in the ovaries or when the ovaries fail to release a mature egg. This is sometimes known as premature ovarian failure . Ovulation problems are common in women with infertility. Possible symptoms: Absent or infrequent periods , unusually light or heavy menstrual bleeding, or lack of such premenstrual symptoms as bloating or breast tenderness. Possible solutions: Managing body weight if it's too low or too high, taking fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination ), and having in vitro fertilization (IVF) . Success rates: Thirty to 40 percent of women taking clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation become pregnant by the third treatment cycle. When fertility drugs to increase egg production are combined with artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 10 and 20 percent per treatment cycle. The percentage of IVF treatment cycles resulting in a live birth (in which one or more babies are born) is about: 40 percent for women age 34 and under 31 percent for women age 35 to 37 21 percent for women age 38 to 40 11 percent for women age 41 to 42 5 percent for women age 43 and over  Endometriosis Endometriosis is a condition that occurs when tissue normally found in the lining of the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows outside the uterus, usually in the abdomen or pelvis. Possible symptoms: Some women have no symptoms, while others have painful periods or intercourse, heavy bleeding or unusual spotting, and general pelvic pain. Possible solutions: Surgery to remove endometrial tissue or open blocked fallopian tubes, fertility drugs (with or without artificial insemination), and IVF. Success rates: A large study found that 30 percent of women with infertility related to early stage endometriosis conceived naturally within three years after having laparoscopic surgery to remove endometrial tissue. When women with early stage endometriosis are treated with fertility drugs and artificial insemination, the pregnancy rate is between 9 and 15 percent per treatment cycle. The live birth rate per treatment cycle for women with endometriosis who undergo IVF ranges from 2 to 42 percent, depending on the woman's age.  Poor egg quality The quality and number of eggs the ovaries produce – naturally or with fertility treatment – declines significantly after age 35. Possible symptoms: None. Possible solutions: Fertility drugs, IVF using your own eggs, IVF with donor eggs or donor embryos . Success rates: Women who have IVF using donor eggs have an approximate 55 percent chance of having a baby per IVF cycle.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which small follicles in the ovaries don't develop into the larger, mature follicles that release eggs. It's also characterized by hormone imbalances and unpredictable ovulation patterns . Possible symptoms:  irregular periods , excessive hair growth, acne, and obesity.

Here are seven common myths to watch out for -- and help dispel. Myth 1: It's easy for most women to get pregnant. While it's true that many woman conceive without difficulty, more than five million people of childbearing age in the United States -- or one in every 10 couples -- have problems with infertility. Certain health conditions and factors, such as age, can affect a woman's ability to conceive. For instance, a healthy 30-year-old woman has about a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant each month; while by age 40, her chances drop to about 5 percent a month. But infertility can affect women of any age, and from any background. Myth 2: Men don't have infertility problems. Though it's commonly believed that infertility is a "women's problem," nothing is further from the truth. About 35 percent of all infertility cases treated in the United States are due to a female problem. But 35 percent (an equal number!) can be traced to a male problem, 20 percent to a problem in both partners, and 10 percent to unknown causes. Myth 3: Infertility is a psychological -- not physical -- problem. Well-meaning friends and relatives may suggest "infertility is all in your head" or "if you'd stop worrying so much, you'd get pregnant." But in reality, infertility is a disease or condition of the reproductive system -- and not a psychological disorder. In fact, one or more physical causes are identified in the vast number of infertile couples. So while relaxing, going on vacation, or finding positive ways to de-stress can improve your overall well-being, these lifestyle changes won't solve your infertility problems. Myth 4: Couples who "work" hard enough at having a baby will eventually get pregnant. New methods of diagnosing and treating infertility have improved many couples' chances of having a baby. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), more than half of all couples who pursue treatment will achieve a successful pregnancy. On the other hand, it's important to remember that infertility is a medical disease and that problems sometimes remain untreatable -- no matter how hard a couple "works" at solving them. Myth 5: Once a couple adopts a child, the woman will become pregnant. This particular myth is not only painful for infertile couples to hear, but it's also untrue. First of all, it suggests that adoption is simply a means to an end (a pregnancy), and not, in and of itself, a valid and wonderful way to form a family. Secondly, only about 5 percent of couples who do adopt later become pregnant. This success rate is the same for couples who don't adopt and become pregnant without further treatment. Myth 6: Husbands often leave their wives if they're infertile. As stated earlier, infertility is a medical condition that affects both men and women equally. In fact, about 40 percent of the time, the male partner is either the sole or contributing cause of infertility, according to ASRM. While many couples do find the process of infertility testing and treatment rigorous, stressful, and intrusive (not to mention costly), they do get through it -- together. Many partners also find new and deeper ways of relating to each other and discover that their marriage has become even stronger. Myth 7: Infertile couples will never be happy or fulfilled. Being unable to conceive a much-wanted child (or carry a pregnancy to term) can fill a couple with sadness, grief, anger, despair, and even a sense of personal failure. While it's normal for infertile couples to experience a range of powerful emotions, most people do move through this life crisis successfully and gradually put it into better perspective. For some couples, "moving on" means letting go of their initial dreams of having a baby. Other couples decide to adopt. But in either case, couples do learn that there is life after infertility and find myriad ways to fulfill themselves -- with or without children.

You're not alone, no matter what age you are. Although it's no secret that pregnancy risks do increase as you age, there is still good news for moms looking to conceive. Get the details about infertility at every decade, including the risks to you and your baby, and ways to boost your fertility. By Dina Roth Port  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Women of all ages know far too well what it's like to hear their biological clock ticking away. It can be stressful knowing there's a time limit to fertility, but as with all health issues, knowledge is power. Here's a look at the pros and cons of attempting to get pregnant in each decade, and what you can do to better your chances. Are You Maximizing Your Fertility? In Your 20s         Shutterstock  Odds of Getting Pregnant Biologically, this is the prime time to get pregnant. In fact, the odds that a woman in her 20s will get pregnant each month are around 20 to 25 percent, the highest they'll ever be. But this doesn't mean that young women can't face fertility issues. "No one is immune to infertility," says Richard Paulson, M.D., chief of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. "While women in their 20s generally have good egg quality, all the other causes of infertility can still be present, such as tubal issues and low sperm count in the male partner." Your Health From a physical standpoint, there are many benefits to starting a family in your 20s. Not only do you have higher odds of getting pregnant, you also have lower chances of experiencing complications such as miscarriages and chromosomally abnormal pregnancies, as well as health issues that include gestational diabetes. On average, younger women's bodies can often handle the demands of pregnancy better than their older counterparts can, and new moms in their 20s may have a lot more energy to run after toddlers. Plus, if you want to have a large family, you'll have more time to space out birthing your kids. Just keep in mind: Many experts recommend that women wait at least 18 months or more before trying to get pregnant again. Talk to your doctor about what's best for you. The Risks The risk of developing preeclampsia -- when a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in her urine -- is highest among first pregnancies, when most women in their 20s are likely expecting for the first time. Preeclampsia, in rare cases, can lead to serious complications for both the mother and fetus, but it is usually manageable. There's also the emotional factor of having kids at a young age, especially when women veer off their professional path, which they might regret down the road. "Many women who conceive in their 20s feel like they didn't pursue their dreams or achieve the career goals they had hoped they would," explains Aimee Raupp, fertility expert and author of Yes, You Can Get Pregnant: Natural Ways to Improve Your Fertility Now and into your 40s . "Some say they rushed into getting married or finding their partner and now have some regrets surrounding their relationship." (Of course, that's not always the end of the story: Once these women's kids are older, many resume following their passions.) Some women in their 20s still have a lot of debt (like school loans) and they might not be as financially secure as they'd like to be before bringing a child into the mix. This can add a lot of stress to any relationship. Common Causes of Infertility Risks to the Baby All pregnancies come with risks, but many risks increase with age. According to the American Pregnancy Association, the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is 1/1600 at age 20 and 1/1300 at age 25. Risks of any chromosomal abnormality are 1/526 and 1/476, respectively. But keep in mind that these are the risks at birth . "The vast majority of pregnancies with chromosomal abnormalities at any age result in spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester," says Eric Widra, M.D., medical director of the Shady Grove Fertility Center, a leading fertility center in the United States, and director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Georgetown University. Ways to Boost Fertility Younger women might still have some bad habits left over from their high school or college days that can sabotage fertility. They may still subsist on a diet composed of a lot of fast food and alcohol, or they may not have lost the "Freshman 15." The good news is that women in their 20s can still take steps to optimize their odds of getting pregnant. For instance, weight plays an important role in conception, but many young women tend to be very underweight or overweight, explains Raupp. "Maintaining a normal BMI and adopting a pre-conception plan of eating a nutrient-dense diet, limiting alcohol and caffeine, and avoiding cigarettes helps a woman achieve her most optimal health prior to conception," she says. "That way, she can more likely conceive with ease, have a healthy pregnancy, and bring a child into a healthy home." When to Seek Help Traditionally, women in their 20s have been advised to seek help from a fertility specialist after trying to get pregnant for a full year, but some experts suggest you should see a doctor even sooner. "I recommend getting help after six months of trying, even sooner if you suspect something is wrong, such as having irregular periods," says Dr. Paulson. In fact, if you aren't getting your period at all or if your cycles are longer than every 35 days, seek help immediately, says Dr. Widra. Talk to your doctor if you have a family history of early menopause or a known history of pelvic abnormalities, sexual dysfunction, or any other medical conditions that might affect fertility, including your partner's medical problems, which may affect his sperm count. Treatment Options The treatment options don't vary much based on age -- they just vary in their effectiveness. For instance, there's ovulation induction through the use of oral medication and intrauterine inseminations. "In vitro fertilization [IVF] is the most effective treatment for most forms of infertility," says Dr. Widra. For women under 35, the success rate of IVF is 41 to 43 percent, according to the American Pregnancy Association. Along with age, however, factors that can affect whether or not IVF works include a woman's reproductive history, her particular diagnosis, and her partner's sperm count. Don't discount the male's role in fertility. "Male factors are present in 30 to 50 percent of couples seeking care for infertility," says Dr. Widra. "Semen analyses are, as I tell my patients, pain-free, risk-free, and inexpensive. This is a critical step in evaluation." In Your 30s Odds of Getting Pregnant On average, a woman in her 30s has a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant each month. Fertility gradually declines throughout the decade, especially after age 35. Your Health         Goodluz/Shutterstock  Women in their 30s still have the stamina to handle middle-of-the-night feedings and basic baby care, and they have more financial security than when they were younger. "A woman in her 30s is more settled in her own skin, and since her peer group is more likely to have children around the same age, she has that support network," adds Raupp. Though fertility is dipping a bit, it's not necessarily in the danger zone, especially for women in their early 30s. The Risks According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, as a woman reaches her mid- to late 30s, she's less likely to become pregnant and more like to have miscarriages because the quality and quantity of her eggs are dwindling. Women at this age might feel tremendous anxiety when it comes to having children. "Women in their 30s are trying to keep up with their friends who are starting a family, and their doctors and family members often pressure them to get pregnant immediately for fear of fertility challenges due to advancing maternal age," says Raupp. "I often see a lot of emotional stress surrounding conception for these women." Risks to the Baby The risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is 1/1000 for mothers who give birth at 30 and 1/365 for those who give birth at 35. Risks of any chromosomal abnormality are 1/384 and 1/197, respectively. Ways to Boost Fertility Along with making sure their weight falls in a normal BMI range and that they are following a preconception plan, women in their 30s should consider the birth control they've been using. "If they've been on the pill for over five years, they should plan to stop it before trying to conceive," says Raupp. "The body may need time to reestablish a regular ovulatory cycle." Although some women may have delays in resuming their menstruation cycle, plenty of women will still be able to get pregnant right away. In fact, "the vast majority of women will revert to their historical cycle pattern and fertility as soon as they stop," says Dr. Widra. So you don't have to stop taking birth control too far in advance of trying to conceive, but always consult your gynecologist about the best plan for you. When to Seek Help Women in their early 30s should get help after trying for six months to a year; those between 35 and 39 should definitely seek assistance after six months. If you have any of the risk factors mentioned for women in their 20s, talk to your doctor about possibly seeing a specialist sooner. Treatment Options A woman in her 30s has the same options as women in their 20s, but the course of action might vary by the diagnosis, the specific age of a patient, and other factors, says Dr. Widra. If you're going to seek treatment for infertility, it's best to do it sooner than later, especially if you want to get pregnant without the use of donor eggs. "The real issue with aging is that the opportunity to help couples declines rapidly with age, and time becomes a more valuable commodity," says Dr. Widra. In Your 40s Odds of Getting Pregnant By age 40, a woman's odds of getting pregnant is less than 5 percent each month. For women ages 45 to 49, those odds dip as low as 1 percent. Pregnancy Risks After Age 35 Your Health         Goodluz/Shutterstock  Many women who have children in their 40s feel very prepared for motherhood, even though they know the odds are lower when it comes to fertility. "Women in their 40s often seem at peace around the potential obstacles when it comes to conceiving," adds Raupp. "That's not to say that many of them aren't dealing with the same stressors of younger women, but they seem more at ease in their own skin, more confident mentally and financially, and more willing to follow a plan to optimize their health and fertility." The Risks But all obstetrical risks (such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, miscarriage, delivery complications, the need for a Cesarean, prolonged labor, and giving birth to a child with a genetic disorder) increase as a woman gets older. And the quantity and quality of a woman's eggs -- the key to fertility -- are both rapidly declining. "In the world of reproduction, nothing gets better with age," says Dr. Paulson. Risks to the Baby The risk of Down syndrome is 1/90 at age 40 and 1/30 at age 45. Risks of any chromosomal abnormality is 1/66 and 1/21, respectively. Ways to Boost Fertility Along with the healthy lifestyle changes that women in their 20s and 30s should adopt, it helps greatly to put things in perspective. "Age shouldn't always be taken as a guarantee of fertility," says Raupp. "When one optimizes health -- mentally, physically, and nutritionally -- then fertility may optimize as well. My biggest message to all women who are trying to conceive is to have faith in your body, treat it like the palace that it is, and do what you can to achieve emotional peace." This includes making sure you get plenty of sleep each night and that you do what you can to limit stress. Some experts recommend yoga, acupuncture, exercise, or meditation accomplish that, but always talk to your doctor about what's right for you. When to Seek Help The jury's out on when women in their 40s should seek help from a fertility specialist: some say after three months of trying to get pregnant naturally; others say six. But there's nothing wrong with being preemptive. "For women in their 40s whose time is very precious, it's perfectly okay to go in for basic testing even prior to trying," says Dr. Paulson. Treatment Options Women in their 40s have the same treatment options as do those in their 20s and 30s, though success rates are drastically lower. For instance, by age 44, a woman's odds of becoming pregnant through IVF are less than10 percent. Keep in mind, however, that while it's true to say that fertility declines with age, it's more precise to say that it declines with the age of a woman's eggs. That's why older women might want to (or need to) consider egg donation as a means of getting pregnant. "Women in their 40s who are recipients of eggs donated by younger women get pregnant at the same rate as the women who donate those eggs," explains Dr. Paulson. "That is why egg donation is so effective in circumventing the biological clock -- it's all about the egg!" Trying to Conceive: 5 Common Fertility Mistakes Copyright © 2015 Meredith Corporation.

You’re Not the Only One By Elli Thompson Purtell Apr 20 2015 A few years ago, at the ripe old age of 26, I confided to a friend that I was convinced I would have a hard time getting pregnant . To be clear, I wasn’t trying to get pregnant . I wasn’t even considering trying to get pregnant anytime in the near future. I simply had a dreaded feeling that it would be a struggle whenever the day arrived. I expected my friend to be surprised, to ask why, to tell me not to worry because it would work out. Instead, she rolled her eyes and said, “Elli, everyone thinks she can’t get pregnant.” I was floored. Don’t women spend most of their adulthood worrying about the opposite? But as it turns out, my friend was on to something. Over the next year or so, as conversations about babies became more prevalent within my age group, I talked to more and more women who felt the same way. We were all younger than 30, and though we'd never tried, we shared the same worry we'd never be able to conceive. While the discourse about infertility is beyond needed, it can also have an unintended side effect: In some cases, women are changing their life plans based on the fear that they too will have trouble conceiving. A post on a babyandbump.com discussion board sums it up best: “I thought I was the only one! I don’t know why I would think this, but I have a deep fear of not being able to conceive.” With increased openness about infertility and IVF treatments and ongoing and discussions about America’s “infertility crisis,” women are thinking about — and fearing — infertility more than ever. While the discourse about infertility is beyond needed, it can also have an unintended side effect: In some cases, women are changing their life plans based on the fear that they too will have trouble conceiving. Courtney Unger, a nurse and mother of two living in Minneapolis, was fairly certain she would have trouble getting pregnant when she was married at 25. “For whatever reason, I assumed it would take a while,” she tells Bustle. “My mom had a hard time conceiving, so I think I was just under the assumption that the majority of people had a hard time getting pregnant.”Instead, Courtney got pregnant on her honeymoon, just over a month after going off the birth control pill. “Hell yeah, we were surprised!” she says. “I realized that I was due to get my period, which was always very regular when on the pill, so I thought maybe my body was just adjusting to new hormones.” 94 percent of women are fertile, and 89 percent will not have any trouble getting pregnant. Although the chances of getting pregnant in one try like Courtney are fairly low (20–40 percent) , 85 percent of all couples trying to conceive will get pregnant within 12 months . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 94 percent of American women are fertile and 89 percent will not have any trouble getting pregnant. The numbers are similar in Great Britain, where according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service , 90 percent of women age 19–39 will conceive after two years of actively trying to have a baby. Yet panic remains, and it’s not hard to see why. Infertility is real . The stigma attached to childless women is real. Watching others suffer from infertility is gut wrenching, and imagining going through that painful experience contributes to women’s fears and doctors’ warnings. Julianne Zweifel, a clinical psychologist and clinical adjunct professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , regularly witnesses the heartbreak of infertility in her profession. '[If you're young], the odds [of getting pregnant] are still dramatically in your favor," she says. “But if you’re the person on the negative end of that percentage, it’s bad. When you are 30 years old and you have fertility problems, you are even angrier than when you’re 36.” “You have a backdrop in society of women having kids later and later,” Zweifel says. “You think, ‘Maybe this is more possible’ and you’re lulled into a false sense of security. [But] we weren’t just created in 2014 with bodies that were created in 2014. It really might work out, but the older you get, the less likely that is.” The other side of this story — unplanned pregnancies or rushed timelines — has consequences of its own: financial stress, sacrificing an education or a career, relationship/marriage struggles, resentment and low self-esteem, just to name a few. Half of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and 40 percent of those end in abortion. Colleen Krajewski, M.D. MPH, a gynecologist affiliated with The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , feels strongly about drawing equal attention to the consequences of perceived infertility, especially because they are more likely to occur than infertility itself. Half of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and 40 percent of those end in abortion. “This seems much less talked about than infertility," Krajewski says. "My perspective is that I see women on an almost daily basis who have an unintended pregnancy based on incorrectly perceived infertility, and my patients can also feel ashamed, guilty, or stigmatized.” With a barrage of statistics and an endless supply of messages on infertility floating around, Zweifel and Krajewski agree that women must educate themselves and visit their doctors to gain a thorough understanding of what all this information means. Basing a decision on one article, a targeted campaign , or what a friend heard may not be the best approach. For example, women hear all the time that age affects fertility. Although this is true and should not be taken lightly, it’s important to understand how and to what extent it plays a role. The chances of becoming pregnant quickly (within a year) decrease significantly as women age, particularly after age 35. According to a study in Helen A. Cacio's Management of the Infertile Woman  , women ages 20–24 have an 86 percent chance of conceiving within a year. Women ages 30–34 have a 63 percent chance. The chances of women of all those ages becoming pregnant after trying for two years , however, leaps up to 90–94 percent . “I think it’s good to talk to your doctor about any risk factors you may actually have, as opposed to perceive, with regard to infertility, and also the actual incidence of infertility with age,” Krajewski says. "I encourage women and couples to parent when they are ready. Don't push up your timetable based on fear." She also suggests setting aside a specific visit for “ preconception counseling ,” rather than asking a quick question at the end of an annual exam, to ensure a thorough review of medical history and enough time to create a plan for optimizing pregnancy chances. “Each woman can make a decision about what risk of infertility she’s OK with,” Krajewski says. “I encourage women and couples to parent when they are ready. Don’t push up your timetable based on fear. On the other hand, have a realistic expectation that conception may not be as easy at age 40 as at age 20.” At age 29, I now feel a sense of peace having a better understanding of fertility. I also visited my gynecologist specifically to ask questions and better understand my fertility . I want children badly, but I also know that now is not the right time. Although I’ll never truly know if I can get pregnant until I try, it’s immensely liberating to allow logic to lead the way. Deciding when and why to have children is a personal decision for every woman, and knowledge, not fear, will breed the best choices.

The Key Signs of Pregnancy Home Pregnancy Tests            While most of us may think that when it comes down to it we’ll be able to have a baby with no trouble at all, encountering fertility problems can be a very real hurdle for a lot of couples. In fact, in about 20% of infertility cases , there can be no direct cause established (IVF can be particularly helpful in such cases).  There are some quite common issues, however, and we will cover those here. Since most people who do not have underlying fertility problems will be able to get pregnant within a year, if it’s taking you longer than that it’s a good time to contact your healthcare providers. They will be able to refer you to a fertility specialist, who will explain you how to have a baby despite these very common fertility problems.  Trouble with Ovulation  This is where it begins, because if you are not ovulating (either at all, or regularly), you simply will not get pregnant. Your healthcare provider will be able to carry out the necessary tests to find out the source of the problem and will evaluate whether or not you are suffering from any conditions that commonly cause ovulation interruption, such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS causes cysts on the ovaries, which often stops eggs from reaching the fallopian tubes (wherein they would travel to your womb, and attach as a pregnancy). You may have this condition if you experience disproportionate hair growth, acne, have erratic or faint periods, or if you’ve gained a lot of weight.  Many women successfully overcome their PCOS and go on to deliver healthy babies. Your doctor will suggest a combination of weight loss, fertility drugs and treatments, and hormone therapy. Some women are good candidates for laser treatment on their ovaries. Even if your ovulation issues are not PCOS-related, your specialists will use these measures to best stimulate your ovaries into working correctly. You may be offered fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI).  Whether or not you are suffering from PCOS, you may be advised to lose some weight and start living a healthier lifestyle with a balanced diet. Being overweight can greatly affect your chances of getting pregnant. You should consult your doctor to determine the ideal weight for you and take care not to become too underweight either, as it will have a similarly negative impact on your wish to have a baby.  Trouble with Sperm  Oligospermia, or low sperm count, is one of the fertility problems that can be slightly easier to overcome (as is asthenospermia, or sperm that isn’t very fast). He may find that losing a little weight and consuming less alcohol will reverse the problem. If it doesn’t, it may be the case that his problems are a little more complex than first thought. His doctor will examine a sperm sample (if ejaculation is not possible, it can be collected directly from his testes), and is then able to extract the fastest, most mobile sperm. Using IUI, his best sperm can then be injected directly into your uterus when you are ovulating. You will most likely be given a hormonal injection to give your egg the best chance of being fertilized by his sperm.  Sometimes, however, there are not sufficient healthy sperm in a semen sample to qualify for an IUI. In this case, an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (or ICSI) could be an option. It’s a difficult and lengthy process, during which the woman must undergo extensive hormone treatment to make sure she releases as many eggs as possible (which must then be harvested from her). If he does not produce any sperm at all, and is wondering, “But how can we get pregnant now?”, it may be time to consider a sperm donor .  Endometriosis  Within your uterus, there is a tissue called the endometrium. When you have endometriosis, this tissue can begin to grow outside of your womb, usually on your ovaries or the lining of your stomach. This condition can be extremely painful and is usually at its worst when you menstruate. It’s possible to have treatment to deal with the endometriosis, but this is separate from handling the infertility it can cause (though it may help). If the growing endometrium has obstructed your fallopian tubes or ovaries, IVF may be necessary to conceive.  Fallopian Tubes  When your fallopian tubes are blocked, it means that eggs cannot travel successfully from your ovaries to your womb. The blockages can have many causes: endometriosis (which we just talked about), fibroids (which we will cover in a moment), or complications from a previous procedure in that area. Since the egg cannot reach the safety of the womb, it will sometimes attach to the lining of the fallopian tubes, and if it is fertilized this will cause an ectopic pregnancy. If just one tube is obstructed, you still have a chance at getting pregnant every second month, as you still have one tube that’s open. Sometimes all it takes is a simple surgery to remove a part of the tube and restore it to function, although if it is more complicated, IVF may be the best option. In this eventuality, the sperm and egg will be extracted from the partners, mixed in a lab, and a couple of fertilized eggs are transplanted back into the woman’s uterus, thus bypassing the fallopian tubes altogether.  Fibroids  Fibroids are benign tumors in your uterus and can be extremely painful, especially during sex. They also cause excessive bleeding during menstruation, and if ignored will just continue to grow. Fibroids are not exactly the cause of infertility, but because they grow within your womb they can hinder pregnancy greatly or even prevent it completely. If you are diagnosed with this condition, you will be offered drugs to minimize the fibroids, and they can also be surgically removed.

There are also risk factors, things that make it more likely you may have difficulty getting pregnant. While many couples will have no signs or symptoms, if you do have any, you should talk to your doctor sooner than later. Infertility is defined by how long you have been trying to conceive unsuccessfully. If you have been trying for one year without success—or for six months, if you’re age 35 or older —then your doctor will diagnose you as being infertile.         But do you have to try for a year to know if there may be a problem? Here are some questions to ask yourself and your partner. If you answer yes to any of these, speak to your doctor  before you spend a year trying on your own. Irregular Menstrual Cycles When menstruation begins, having irregular periods can be normal. It takes the body awhile to get regulated. Once you’ve passed your teenage years, your cycles should be regular. An irregular cycle can be a red flag for infertility problems and may be a sign of an ovulation problem. If your cycles are unusually short or long (less than 24 days or more than 35 days), or they come unpredictably, speak with your doctor. If you don't get your periods at all, you absolutely must talk to your doctor. There are a variety of causes for irregular periods. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of irregular cycles and ovulation-related infertility.   Other possible causes for irregular periods include hyperprolactinemia, primary ovarian insufficiency , thyroid dysfunction, low ovarian reserves , being over or underweight, and excessive exercise . Light/Heavy Bleeding and Cramps Bleeding for anything between three to seven days can be considered normal.         However, if the bleeding is very light or extremely heavy and intense, you should see your doctor. Other period-related symptoms that may indicate a fertility problem include: Significant changes in bleeding heaviness Significant changes in the length of bleeding days Severe menstrual cramps Unusual spotting between cycles Menstrual cramps that interfere with your daily life can be a symptom of endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease , both of which can cause infertility. Both of these diseases get worse with time, so it’s important you don’t delay seeking help. Age: Older Than 35 Both female and male fertility declines with age. The risk of infertility increases at age 35 for women and continues to grow with time. A 30-year-old woman has a 20 percent chance of conceiving in any one month, while a 40-year-old woman has only a 5 percent chance. Women over 35 are also more likely to experience a miscarriage and to have a child with a congenital disease. Male fertility is also affected by age , though not as drastically as in women. Research has found that with increased age, male fertility and sperm health decreases, including an increase in DNA-damaged sperm. Male age has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, the passing on of genetic problems, and some congenital disabilities.         Increased male age has also been associated with increased rates of autism and schizophrenia. A number of surveys and research studies over the years have found that many women (and men) are unaware of how much female fertility declines with age. People frequently overestimate their chances of conceiving at age 40 or 44. Or they assume IVF treatment alone can solve the issue. (It can't.) A fascinating study looked at what age a couple should start trying to have a family, based on how many kids they eventually want to have and whether they are open to IVF treatment. If you’re not open to IVF treatment, you should start trying to conceive  By age 32, if you want a 90 percent chance of having one child By age 27, if you want two children By age 23, if you want three children If you are open to IVF, the study suggests starting your family By age 35, if you want a 90 percent chance of having one child By age 31, if you want two kids By age 28, if you want three kids IVF treatment is also impacted by male age. One study found that for each additional year of paternal age, there was an 11 percent increased odds of not achieving pregnancy and a 12 percent increase in the odds of not having a live birth. Of course, even if you are young, you’re not guaranteed a baby. Young men and women can also experience infertility. Partner Fertility Male factor infertility isn't always so obvious, and there are rarely symptoms. Usually, low sperm counts or inhibited sperm mobility is determined by a sperm analysis . (In other words, you'll need to go through fertility testing to discover the problem.) But if your partner experiences sexual dysfunction, this could be an infertility red flag. Weight Your weight plays a major role in your fertility. Being overweight —or underweight—can lead to trouble conceiving. In fact, obesity may be one of the most common causes of preventable subfertility. If you are obese, research has found that losing five to ten percent of your weight can jump start ovulation. Being over or underweight can also have an adverse effect on male fertility. Men with a BMI below 20 have been found to have lower sperm concentration and sperm counts, while obese men have been found to have lower levels of testosterone and lower sperm counts. If you are having difficulty with losing extra weight, talk to your doctor. Some hormonal causes of infertility can lead to weight problems. For example, PCOS increases your risk of obesity and happens to also be a cause of infertility. Miscarriage Rate Infertility is usually associated with the inability to get pregnant. However, a woman who experiences recurrent miscarriages may also need help getting pregnant. Miscarriage is not that uncommon. It occurs in 10 to 20 percent of pregnancies. Repeated miscarriage is not common. Only one percent of women will miscarry three pregnancies in a row. If you’ve had two successive miscarriages, talk to your doctor. Chronic Illnesses Chronic diseases, as well as their treatments, can lead to fertility problems. For example, diabetes, untreated celiac disease , periodontal disease , and hypothyroidism can increase your risk for infertility. Sometimes, treatments for chronic illnesses can negatively impact fertility. Insulin, antidepressants, and thyroid hormones may lead to irregular cycles. Tagamet ( cimetidine ), a medication used in treating peptic ulcers, and some hypertension medications can cause male factor infertility . These medications may cause problems with sperm production or their ability to fertilize the egg. Past Cancers Some cancer treatments can lead to fertility problems. If you or your partner has gone through cancer treatments, especially radiation therapy that was near the reproductive organs, seeking feedback from your doctor is recommended. History of STDs Sexually transmitted illnesses (or STDs/STIs) can be the cause of infertility . Infection and inflammation from chlamydia or gonorrhea can cause blockage of the fallopian tubes . This can make pregnancy either impossible or put a woman at risk for an ectopic pregnancy . The same applies for men. Left untreated, an infection can lead to scar tissue within the male reproductive tract, making semen transfer ineffective or even impossible. Because chlamydia and gonorrhea do not usually cause noticeable symptoms in women, it's important that you've been screened for these STDs. Many sexually transmitted infections are symptomless in women. You may feel fine while the disease silently wreaks havoc on your reproductive organs . If you have any symptoms of an STI, see your doctor right away, and if you're at risk of contracting an STI, get regular checks even if you are asymptomatic. Smoking and Alcohol Habits Just about everyone knows drinking and smoking while pregnant is a big no-no. But smoking and drinking while trying to get pregnant is also a problem. Smoking negatively affects sperm counts , sperm shape, and sperm movement, all important factors for conception. IVF treatment success has also been found to be poorer in male smokers, even when IVF with ICSI is used. (ICSI involves taking a single sperm and directly injecting it into an egg.) Smoking is also connected to erectile dysfunction, so dropping the habit may reverse some of the adverse effects. In women, smoking can speed up the process of ovarian aging , bringing on earlier menopause. The good news is that if you quit early enough, you may be able to reverse some of the damage. Heavy drinking can also lead to fertility problems, both for men and women. Most studies have found that a few drinks a week won't cause any harm, but excessive drinking has been linked to lower sperm counts, poor sperm movements, and irregular sperm shape. One study found that with every additional drink consumed per week, the IVF success rate decreased. Toxic Chemicals at Work Does your job involve close contact with toxic chemicals? If so, you may be at greater risk for infertility and decreased sperm health. Farmers, painters, varnishers, metal workers, and welders have all been found to be at risk for reduced fertility. If your job involves toxic chemical contact or high heat conditions, speak to your doctor. There may be more steps you can take to protect yourself. High Temperatures High temperatures are bad news for sperm. You've most likely heard of this in relation to the boxers versus briefs argument. The thinking was that boxers, being less restrictive and having more airflow, would lead to cooler testicular temperatures and healthier levels of fertility. The research isn't clear on whether boxers or briefs matter, although wearing extremely tight shorts or underwear, especially when made from a non-breathable fabric, may have an impact on sperm health. More sources of sperm-troubling heat include: Hot tubbing or long hot baths Sitting for prolonged periods of time with your legs together (like at a desk job or while driving long distances) Sitting with a laptop on your lap Heated car seats The heat damaging effects may have a longer lasting impact than you'd imagine, too. A very small study looked at men who attended a sauna twice a week, for 15 minutes, over a period of three months. When comparing to semen samples taken before the sauna visits, the researchers found decreases in sperm count and movement, as well as more DNA-damaged sperm. The men in the study were again evaluated three months and six months after they stopped attending the sauna. Sperm health wasn't completely regained until six months after the men stopped attending the sauna sessions. A Word From Verywell About 80 percent of couples will conceive within six months, and about 90 percent will be pregnant after a year, if they are having well-timed sexual intercourse . If you don’t get pregnant after one year of trying , you should see your doctor. If you’re 35 years old or older, then you should see your doctor after six months of trying. However, what if you have a possible sign of infertility before the one-year mark? What if you’re at risk for infertility? In that case, talk to your doctor now. Your doctor can run some basic fertility tests . If everything comes back normal, you can continue trying on your own for a while longer. However, if there is a problem, you will have caught it much sooner, and your odds of successful fertility treatment will be higher. Sources: Crosnoe LE, Kim ED. " Impact of age on male fertility ."

Most people know that a woman's fertility decreases as she gets older, but even during her most fertile (and otherwise healthy) years, lifestyle choices and external factors can affect a woman's chances of having a healthy baby.  "Women who want to increase their chances of getting pregnant often don't know the best things to do or what to watch out for," says Francisco Arredondo, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist in San Antonio, Texas. Here are some of factors that do (or don't) affect a woman's fertility, and what you can do about them if you are trying to conceive.

"The more weight a woman gains over her healthy weight, the more she tends to experience decreased ovarian function," he says. And a 2009 study published in Fertility and Sterility found that women who were obese at age 18 were more likely to develop polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and have problems with infertility . PCOS is the most common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, and the leading cause of infertility.

That may be because women who have very low BMIs are deficient in leptin, the hormone that controls hunger and feelings of satiety. Having low leptin contributes to the absence of menstrual periods, according to a 2009 Harvard University study. "Maintaining a healthy body weightone that falls in the normal BMI range and that is reached through a healthy diet and moderate exerciseis one of the most important things a woman can do to increase her chances of getting pregnant," says Dr. Arredondo, who recently helped develop Conceivable, (free; iTunes ) a new app aimed at helping women increase their chances of getting pregnant.

But even in the decade or so before menopause officially occurs, she may experience fertility problems as her ovulation becomes less regular and her egg count declinesa time known as perimenopause. There's no official age when fertility begins to take a dive, but many doctors say that it often becomes increasingly difficult to get pregnant after age 35 . This age is different for every woman, though; some may go through perimenopause earlier, while others remain fertile through their 40s . That's why, says Dr. Schlaff, it's important for women of any age who are having trouble conceiving to see a specialist sooner rather than later.

If she started on the early side, then you probably will, too. "Women are born with a certain amount of eggs," says Dr. Arredondo, "and there are certain genetic factors that might make you born with more or less eggs than usual, or that may make you use those eggs faster than other average women." But you certainly aren't doomed to relive the same exact scenario your mom did. External factors that don't necessarily affect you could have impacted your mom.

Additionally, a 2015 Washington University study found that 15 common chemicals were associated with early menopause . These chemicals include nine PCBs (which have been banned since 1979 but still exist in older products), three pesticides, two forms of plastics called phthalates (often found in personal care items and beauty products like perfumes and nail polishes), and the toxin furan, a byproduct of industrial combustion.

Smoking causes up to 13% of all infertility cases, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. (One 2014 study even found that a woman's smoking may affect the fertility of her sons.) Cigarette smoke disrupts hormones and damages DNA in both men and women, says Dr. Arredondo. "And it doesn't have to be heavy smoking, either," he says. "Even women who smoke moderately or who are exposed to secondhand smoke have disrupted endocrine function and can experience significant fertility issues." RELATED: Pregnant? Diet Changes to Make Right Now    Advertisement                           8 of 16  Getty Images    Alcohol  There's no evidence that a few drinks a week will affect your fertility, but doctors do caution against heavy drinking more than one drink a day for womenwhich has been linked to an increased risk for ovulation disorders. Plus, a 2004 Swedish study that tracked more than 7,000 women for 18 years found that the heaviest drinkers were more likely to have sought out fertility treatment . You probably already know you should stop drinking if you think you could be pregnant. Drinking during the early stages of pregnancy (and possibly even before conception) has been linked to premature births . As for whether it's safe to drink later in pregnancy, the jury's still out. Many doctors say a small amount of alcohol is OK, but the CDC and Surgeon General say it's best not to indulge since there is no proof that it's not harmful to the baby.

"It impacts ovulation," says Dr. Schlaff. "It's not impossibleso it shouldn't be used as your only birth control methodbut it is a decision that can have a negative impact on your fertility." Older moms who want to have another baby before they have to worry about age-related fertility decline should discuss how long to breastfeed with their doctor. Otherwise, it may be better to wait at least a year and a half before having another child, anyway: a 2014 University of Cincinnati College of Medicine study found that women who wait less than 18 months after having a child to conceive again are more likely to have a shorter pregnancy and preterm birth.

Thing is, you can overdo it: "If you're exercising too much it can have a negative impact on ovulation," says Dr. Schlaff. It's not just an issue that affects very thin athletes, either. A 2012 study published in Fertility and Sterility found that normal-weight women who exercised vigorously for more than five hours a week had a harder time getting pregnant. The most obvious sign of a potential problem is a change in menstrual cycle, says Dr. Schlaff. "It doesn't have to go away completely, either," he says. "If you notice that it becomes lighter or shorter, you should talk to your doctor about the implications for your fertility and your health."

The one exception: Depo-Provera, the injectable birth control . Each Depo-Provera injection prevents pregnancy for 12 to 14 weeksand while some women do get pregnant in as little as one month after that protection wears off, it can take other women up to a year to conceive . Doctors recommend women stop using injectable birth control several months before they hope to get pregnant.

"People with significant thyroid disease are typically going to have some pretty obvious symptoms," says Dr. Schlaff, "but subclinical, undiagnosed hypothyroidism is certainly a recognized problem as well, and we know it can have subtle effects on fertility without a woman knowing it." RELATED: 19 Signs Your Thyroid Isn't Working Right    Advertisement                           13 of 16  Getty Images    Caffeine  If you're addicted to venti lattes, some studies suggest you may have trouble getting pregnant. A 2011 study from the Nevada School of Medicine found that caffeine interferes with the muscle contractions that help eggs travel from the ovaries and through the fallopian tubes to the womb, while a 2012 Danish study revealed that drinking five or more cups of coffee a day may cut a woman's chances of successful in vitro fertilization by half. That said, other studies suggest caffeine plays no role in fertility. Either way, if you're struggling to conceive, it's worth taking a look at your caffeine intake and cutting back if you're drinking more than 200 milligrams a daythat's1 to 2 8-ounce cups of coffee.    Advertisement                           14 of 16  Getty Images    Medical conditions  Health issues such as polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids can affect a woman's chances of getting pregnant or successfully carrying a pregnancy to term. Women with autoimmune disorders (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) may also have trouble conceiving, since their bodies may reject a fertilized egg or attack her partner's sperm. In many cases, though, women with these health conditions can still get pregnant and have healthy babies, says Dr. Arredondo. Working with a medical team to manage and improve symptoms, and seeing fertility help if needed, can increase the chances for success. RELATED: 10 Ways to Deal with Painful Sex    Advertisement                           15 of 16  Getty Images    Sexual health history  Sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia and gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and cause fertility problems, even years after a woman contracts them. In fact, chlamydia can cause damage to the fallopian tubes without any other symptoms, and many women may not know they had the disease until they experience trouble getting pregnant. It's important to note, though, that vaginal infections (like yeast infections) have no effect on fertility, says Dr. Schlaff. RELATED: Top 10 Myths About Safe Sex and Sexual Health    Advertisement                 16 of 16     Stress  Women with higher levels of an enzyme linked to stress had a harder time getting pregnant in a 2014 study published in Human Reproduction . Researchers say this study doesn't indicate that stress alone is responsible for fertility problems, but they do suggest that women who have been trying to get pregnant for several months try adopting a stress management program. "Perceived stress can certainly alter hormone levels and ovulation," says Dr. Arredondo. "Stress itself is not bad, but when it is in excessand when we react to it in a negative wayit can have all kinds of impact on our health and our bodies."
