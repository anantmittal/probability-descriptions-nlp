Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.   Information about options: PCOS Fertility Treatment Options and Success Rates      PCOS fertility treatment options include:    Clomid for PCOS   Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS   Metformin for PCOS   Injectable Gonadotropins for PCOS   IVF - In Vitro Fertilization for PCOS       Diagnosing PCO  How do doctors diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome?     Diagnosing PCO with ultrasound - What does a polycystic ovary look like?  In a polycystic ovary, the numerous small cystic structures, also called antral follicles , give the ovaries a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound.

Here, doctors explain why that's extremely unlikely (as are all other IUD complications). Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest George Mattei / Getty Images Sarah Brown is hoping to make the U.S. Olympic track team for the 1,500 meter run at the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials today, just four months after giving birth . Brown didn’t plan to be pregnant while training for the Olympics, but her copper IUD failed…just as she was running her best race times ever. “I went from crushing workouts to, all of a sudden, in the second interval of a workout, I thought I was running in sand. Racing wasn’t fun anymore,” Brown, 29, told New York magazine’s The Cut . “It was really frustrating because we had concentrated so hard on doing things right, and I didn’t feel like I had overtrained. It was like, ‘Why is this happening? What’s wrong with me?’” Brown eventually took an at-home pregnancy test that was negative, but a few weeks later, she went to see her doctor who determined that she was, in fact, pregnant. Brown’s IUD was removed, and her daughter was born in March. Luckily, doctors say this is extremely rare. “IUDs are a very, very reliable method of birth control,” Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. There are a few different kinds of IUDs, all of which are implanted inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy and last anywhere from three to 10 years. Some contain progestin, a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. It thickens cervical mucus, making it tougher for sperm to get to an egg. It also thins the uterine lining so that even if the sperm did reach an available egg, the fertilized egg would have a hard time implanting. Then there's the copper IUD, like the kind Brown used. Those work by causing an inflammatory reaction that harms sperm, says Mayo Clinic . At over 99 percent efficacy , IUDs are the real deal when it comes to preventing pregnancy. Jason James, M.D., medical director at Miami's FemCare Ob-Gyn , agrees, but he also notes that even the best birth control can fail. “There’s nothing that’s 100 percent,” he points out. It rarely ever happens, but Whelihan says there are a few ways IUDs can slip up. One is due to insertion error that goes undetected. Doctors recommend that anyone who gets an IUD comes back around a month later to make sure it's still nestled in the right place in the uterus. Whelihan estimates that more than half of people “don’t show up for that visit because they feel fine and it’s an inconvenience, but it’s important." If IUD moves from the upper cavity of the uterus into the lower segment, it won’t be as effective, Jessica Shepherd, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and director of Minimally Invasive Gynecology at The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, tells SELF. A person's body can also expel the IUD, meaning it can actually fall out, leaving them unprotected against pregnancy. And finally, people are more likely to get pregnant if their IUD expires, Shepherd says. If someone does get pregnant while using an IUD, they're at a greater risk of having an ectopic pregnancy (when the fetus develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes). “Overall, IUDs prevent pregnancy very well, and the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is lower than that of the general population,” James says. “But if [pregnancy while using an IUD] does occur, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is fairly significant.” Getting pregnant while using an IUD can also result in miscarriage . That’s why if someone suspects or discovers that they're pregnant even though they have an IUD, they need to call their doctor right away. Beyond pregnancy, other uncommon complications are possible with IUDs. Whelihan lists perforation of the uterus as one, which happens when the IUD punctures the wall of the uterus or even goes all the way through it. However, she stresses that it’s pretty rare and happens in only about one in 1,000 cases. There is also a risk of infection, James says, but again, it’s not nearly prevalent enough to be a major concern when deciding to get an IUD. Despite Brown’s situation, doctors stress that IUDs are an extremely safe and reliable way to avoid getting pregnant. “I love IUDs," Shepherd says. "They really are one of the best forms of birth control." Related: These Women Are Live-Tweeting Their Periods And We're Here For It Can Stress Actually Make It Harder To Get Pregnant?

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.

Here, doctors explain why that's extremely unlikely (as are all other IUD complications). Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest George Mattei / Getty Images Sarah Brown is hoping to make the U.S. Olympic track team for the 1,500 meter run at the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials today, just four months after giving birth . Brown didn’t plan to be pregnant while training for the Olympics, but her copper IUD failed…just as she was running her best race times ever. “I went from crushing workouts to, all of a sudden, in the second interval of a workout, I thought I was running in sand. Racing wasn’t fun anymore,” Brown, 29, told New York magazine’s The Cut . “It was really frustrating because we had concentrated so hard on doing things right, and I didn’t feel like I had overtrained. It was like, ‘Why is this happening? What’s wrong with me?’” Brown eventually took an at-home pregnancy test that was negative, but a few weeks later, she went to see her doctor who determined that she was, in fact, pregnant. Brown’s IUD was removed, and her daughter was born in March. Luckily, doctors say this is extremely rare. “IUDs are a very, very reliable method of birth control,” Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. There are a few different kinds of IUDs, all of which are implanted inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy and last anywhere from three to 10 years. Some contain progestin, a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. It thickens cervical mucus, making it tougher for sperm to get to an egg. It also thins the uterine lining so that even if the sperm did reach an available egg, the fertilized egg would have a hard time implanting. Then there's the copper IUD, like the kind Brown used. Those work by causing an inflammatory reaction that harms sperm, says Mayo Clinic . At over 99 percent efficacy , IUDs are the real deal when it comes to preventing pregnancy. Jason James, M.D., medical director at Miami's FemCare Ob-Gyn , agrees, but he also notes that even the best birth control can fail. “There’s nothing that’s 100 percent,” he points out. It rarely ever happens, but Whelihan says there are a few ways IUDs can slip up. One is due to insertion error that goes undetected. Doctors recommend that anyone who gets an IUD comes back around a month later to make sure it's still nestled in the right place in the uterus. Whelihan estimates that more than half of people “don’t show up for that visit because they feel fine and it’s an inconvenience, but it’s important." If IUD moves from the upper cavity of the uterus into the lower segment, it won’t be as effective, Jessica Shepherd, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and director of Minimally Invasive Gynecology at The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, tells SELF. A person's body can also expel the IUD, meaning it can actually fall out, leaving them unprotected against pregnancy. And finally, people are more likely to get pregnant if their IUD expires, Shepherd says. If someone does get pregnant while using an IUD, they're at a greater risk of having an ectopic pregnancy (when the fetus develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes). “Overall, IUDs prevent pregnancy very well, and the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is lower than that of the general population,” James says. “But if [pregnancy while using an IUD] does occur, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is fairly significant.” Getting pregnant while using an IUD can also result in miscarriage . That’s why if someone suspects or discovers that they're pregnant even though they have an IUD, they need to call their doctor right away. Beyond pregnancy, other uncommon complications are possible with IUDs. Whelihan lists perforation of the uterus as one, which happens when the IUD punctures the wall of the uterus or even goes all the way through it. However, she stresses that it’s pretty rare and happens in only about one in 1,000 cases. There is also a risk of infection, James says, but again, it’s not nearly prevalent enough to be a major concern when deciding to get an IUD. Despite Brown’s situation, doctors stress that IUDs are an extremely safe and reliable way to avoid getting pregnant. “I love IUDs," Shepherd says. "They really are one of the best forms of birth control." Related: These Women Are Live-Tweeting Their Periods And We're Here For It Can Stress Actually Make It Harder To Get Pregnant?

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.
