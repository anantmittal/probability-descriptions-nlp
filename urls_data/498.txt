Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!  You'll also want to see: What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?             Gender Odds   What are the odds of having another boy or girl?

Visit our community    Can you really choose the sex of your baby? For as long as we've been making babies , women have been exchanging ideas about how to increase their chances of having either a boy or a girl. Unfortunately there's no medical evidence that any of them actually work!  Having said that, there'll always be a mum who tells you an old wives' tale worked for her. So if you fancy defying the experts and trying to tip the balance towards one sex yourself, why not try some of the suggestions below.   You're more likely to conceive a boy if... You have sex on the day of ovulation , as male sperm are thought to swim faster and reach the egg first. You reach orgasm before your partner, as this releases an alkaline fluid, thought to be more male-sperm friendly than the vagina's natural acidity. You have deep penetration during sex, such as from behind (doggie-style). Your partner has a high sperm count. This is because male sperm are not as strong as female sperm, and so the higher the count, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first. You avoid sex for a week before ovulation and then only have sex once on ovulation day, to keep the sperm count high. Your partner suggested the love-making. You make love at night. You make love on odd days of the month. Your partner keeps his genitals cool by wearing boxer shorts and loose-fitting trousers. You eat salty food, plenty of meat, fish, white flour, pasta, fresh fruit, certain vegetables, but avoid milk and dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, nuts, chocolate, shellfish and wholemeal bread. You're more likely to conceive a girl if... You have sex earlier on in your cycle, a few days before your day of ovulation. This is because female sperm are thought to be stronger and therefore last longer than male sperm, who will die off before reaching the egg. Your partner reaches orgasm before you. You have sex frequently to lower your partner's sperm count, and so increase the chances of the female sperm reaching the egg first. You keep penetration shallow. You stop having unprotected sex four to five days before ovulation, to minimise the chances of the male sperm reaching the egg first. Your partner keeps his genitals warm by wearing close-fitting underwear and tight trousers (although this isn't likely to do his general fertility any good!) You suggested the love-making. You make love in the afternoon. You make love on even days of the month. You put a wooden spoon under your bed and a pink ribbon under your pillow. You drink plenty of milk and eat dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, unsalted foods, rice, pasta, certain vegetables, mineral water, limited amounts of meat and potatoes, but avoid salt and any salty foods, wine and beer, fresh fruit, spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms, chocolate, coffee and tea.

I have two boys and have been blogging about wanting to have a girl for some time. I had gone through most of the experiences posted by women, like gender dieting, douching etc but they didn't really make any sense to me. Ultimately, I picked Urobiologics (based in the US) who have literally proven that, although gender is 'determined' by sperms, women select the gender of the baby based on the cycle she conceives, by choosing to conceive in the correct alternating cycle. We were given a conception plan to try to conceive in the girl cycle (you send off urine samples to Urobiologics, who will then determine when you will be in a boy or girl cycle). We became pregnant with our girl (we used their post-gender test to check the gender of the baby at around 7 weeks). Sadly our little Poppy girl died at 16 weeks (31 Oct) due to a PPROM, so we are leaving it a couple of months to heal and then go via the PreGender Preconception Test route again. I'm ready now!

They say if the baby is on the right side of the uterus then its a boy, if its on the left side then its a girl.  Here is a link to the study...  hcp.obgyn.net/fetal-monitoring/cont...  So lets test it because I think if it was that accurate it would be more widely discussed.  So if you have a previous LO  (little one) and had an early U/S, go back and look at it and see which side of the uterus its on.  This only works for the vaginal u/s because the ones done on the stomach are opposite sides.  Here is my u/s today for an example, the baby is on the left side, so by this its a girl.  Guess time will tell        --  ~A s h l e y I love Camden, Grayer, DH  and MY KTT GIRLS!

But if you're trying to conceive one or the other, here are some fun tips to try to tip the scales. For the record, I followed all the tips for a boy and welcomed our second baby girl with open arms last year. It did give me a sense of satisfaction knowing I'd tried though.

So don't wait until you ovulate. Use our handy dandy ovulation calculator to help you plan to do the deed two or more days before ovulation. Or you could try The Whelan Method , named after Elizabeth Whelan, author of Boy or Girl, which is basically the opposite approach. The Shettles Method boasts a slightly higher success rate of 75 percent at conceiving the child of choice.

That is supposedly more favorable for Y-chromosome (boy) sperm. Check the ingredients list to be sure you're getting one with only the guaifenesin and not one for multi-cold symptoms.

So it's like giving those faster, male sperm a head start to the finish line. Don't feel cheated though; you'll get yours soon.

So try an alkaline diet a few weeks before conception. Here's an acid/alkaline food chart to get you started. Bumping up your sodium and potassium intake is also suggested for those trying to conceive boys. Start off your morning with a power smoothie with green powder. If nothing else, it will get you healthier, which is great for your pre-baby body.

If only we'd tell you that your chances of conceiving a boy would increase by consuming chocolate while catching up on your Netflix list in your yoga pants too, right? Hit the weights, and focus on strength training because weight loss is said to sway toward baby girls.  Shutterstock Image     Shutterstock For a Girl Skip  the Salt Salt is not good for you or your chances of having a girl, supposedly. The theory is to make dietary changes to alter your body's pH levels a few weeks before trying to conceive. Acidic conditions are said to kill boy sperm. However, this doesn't mean covering your food in lemon and vinegar. Here's an acid/alkaline food chart for reference. Bumping up your calcium and magnesium intake is also suggested.  Shutterstock Image     Shutterstock For a Boy Consult  the Kama Sutra Sexual positions that provide deeper penetration, like doggy style, give the faster, male Y sperm a head start farther away from the more acidic entrance of the vagina.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

What are the signs I'm having a baby girl?  Take our boy or girl quiz      Video Boy or girl? Watch how your baby develops into a boy or girl.  You're bound to be curious about your baby's gender , even if you're waiting until the birth to find out. But what if you could tell just by the season in which you conceived, or by what job your partner has? Folk tales are one thing, but what real-life factors may affect the gender of your baby?  What are the signs I'm having a baby boy? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a boy if:  You and your partner are living together  One large study of 86,000 parents showed that couples who were living together when they conceived were slightly more likely to have a boy (Norberg 2004) .  Just over half (51.5 per cent) of couples living together before conception had a boy, compared with 49.9 per cent of those who lived apart. But why domestic bliss results in more boys is not entirely clear.  You've been living together for less than a year  If your relationship is new and exciting, you'll probably be having lots of sex (Brewis and Meyer 2005) . Frequent sex gives male sperm a slightly bigger advantage than usual.  Male sperm are lighter, have smaller heads, and shorter tails (Jongbloet 2004) . They can swim more easily through the slightly less hospitable fertile mucus , which coincides with the beginning and the end of your fertile window . This includes the time of ovulation (Jongbloet 2004) .  Some experts think that female sperm are more likely to reach the egg in the middle of your fertile period (James 2008) .  By having frequent sex, you are more likely to have sex at the start and end of your fertile window, when male sperm have a slight advantage.  You're feeling stressed  Boys tend to be conceived at times of sustained stress , such as during and following a war (Helle et al 2009, Hohmann et al 2010) .  One theory is that the mum's high stress levels leads to increases in testosterone and cortisol (Grant 2007, Grant and Irwin 2009) . This may lead to changes in the egg, which make it easier for male sperm to penetrate.  Just how this happens isn't clear, but there is still so much we don't know about the exact moment of conception .  You have a higher calorie intake  One study divided 740 British women into groups according to their calorie intake (Mathews et al 2008) . Of the women who had the highest energy intake (about 2,413 calories), 56 per cent had boys. Of the women who had the lowest energy intake (about 2,283 calories), only 45 per cent had boys.  Boys are more fragile and are statistically less likely to be conceived, or to survive pregnancy, when food is short. Girl sperm are more robust, so in harder times they may be more able to survive.  But it's clear that, whether you're having a boy or a girl, a healthy diet is important both before you conceive and during pregnancy .  What are the signs I'm having a baby girl? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a girl if:  You're over 35 years old and the dad-to-be is over 40 years old  The older the mum and dad , the more likely the female sperm are to fertilise the egg (Matsuo et al 2009) . This could be due to hormonal influences in the woman as she ages. And in older dads , the female sperm is more likely to win the race. The quality of sperm deteriorates with age and older men produce fewer male sperm.  Or it could be because we tend to have sex less often (Brewis 2005) as we get older. Also, older couples may be more likely to have sex in the middle of the fertile period, when female sperm may have the edge over male sperm.  You suffer badly from pregnancy sickness  If you have severe pregnancy sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum), you're slightly more likely to have a baby girl.  A review of 13 studies found that 55 per cent of babies born to women who'd had severe pregnancy sickness were girls (Veenendaal et al 2011) . This was compared with 49 per cent in the control group of women who didn't suffer from it. Some experts think that this is due to high levels of the hormone oestrogen, which is linked with pregnancy sickness .  You were born in a tropical climate and conceived there  Fancy a long holiday, somewhere warm?  It's not clear how much time you and your partner would need to spend in a tropical climate for there to be any effect, or if you would need to have been born there, too. But a global survey of birth data showed that more girls are born in the tropics (the region around the equator) than anywhere else in the world (Navara 2009) .  One theory is that the hormone melatonin has an effect. Melatonin causes changes in the reproductive systems of animals in response to the length of the day. More females are born when the days are longer. Or it could be that a high temperature alters the survival of male or female sperm in semen.  Your baby was conceived in the winter  However, in some countries, more girls are conceived in winter, and more boys are conceived in the summer (Cagnacci et al 2003, Melnikov and Grech 2003) . Farmers have noticed this effect in their animals for many years.  This may be because more viral and bacterial infections are around in the winter. As male sperm and embryos are more fragile, girls may be more able to withstand mums catching infections than boys.  Dad-to-be's job involves pollutants or stress  A few studies have looked at the dad's occupation and the ratio of boys and girls born to them. They found that jobs that involve stress or pollutants seem to result in more girls.  Though they were small-scale studies, which only looked at certain occupations, dads with the following jobs resulted in more girls than average:   professional driver (James 2008) deep-sea diver (James 2008) submarine sonar technician (Volk 2004) flour mill worker (Milham and Ossiander 2008) high-performance pilot (James 2008)  You conceived after having your ovulation induced hormonally  Some studies carried out among women who used hormones to induce ovulation, such as clomifene , show that you are slightly more likely to have a girl if artificial hormones are involved (James 2008) . However, other experts aren't convinced.  You already have two or more children  It's possible that the more children you have, the more likely you are to have a girl. This may be due to the fact that the more pregnancies you have, the higher your levels of the hormone gonadotrophin (James 1980) . Some experts have claimed that these higher hormonal levels could be linked to a higher chance of having a girl.  Take our boy or girl quiz  Find out whether you're more likely to have a girl or a boy. Last reviewed: October 2013   References   Brewis A, Meyer M. 2005. Marital coitus across the life course.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

It's in your genes, dad  By Fiona Macrae for the Daily Mail    Updated: 18:28 EDT, 10 December 2008                     View comments          The 'fatherhood gene': Researchers claim a man's chances of having a boy or a girl are decided by his genes  A man's chances of fathering a boy or a girl are written in his genes, research suggests.   Analysis of more than 900 family trees dating back to 1600 has suggested the existence of a ' fatherhood gene' that determines the sex of a man's children.   As men inherit the gene from their parents, males who have lots of brothers are likely to have sons and those with many sisters have high odds of fathering daughters. Corry Gellatly, a research scientist at Newcastle University, analysed the histories of 927 European and American families, comprising more than 500,000 people. The results suggested that a gene controls whether a man's sperm contains more X or Y chromosomes, which in turn determine the sex of his children. A child's sex is determined by the father because a woman's eggs only contain X chromosomes. When one of these combines with a sperm carrying an X chromosome, a girl is created. If it combines with a Y, the result is a boy.    It is thought that the gene comes in three forms. Men that inherit the first produce more Y sperm and have more sons. Those with the second-type produce equal numbers of X and Y sperm and so are as likely to have a boy as a girl. The third form skews the tendency towards daughters, the journal Evolutionary Biology reports. Mr Gellatly said the simple system would help keep the number of boys and girls born roughly equal. He said: 'If there are too many males in the population, for example, females will more easily find a mate, so men who have more daughters will pass on more of their genes, causing more females to be born in later generations.' The theory could also explain why shortly after the First World War an extra two boys were born for every 100 girls in the UK compared with before. Mr Gellatly said the odds were in favour of men with more sons seeing a son return from the war.  The soldiers would have inherited the tendency to have sons and so be more likely to father boys themselves. By contrast, men with more daughters may have lost their only sons in the war.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!

There are 4 things that increase your chances of having a girl.
1. Have sex from the last day of your period (every day) to just 3 or 4 days before you are ovulating. You can do this with an ovulation kit. Studies have shown that girl sperm live much longer than boy sperm. Doing this will allow the girl sperm to stay alive long enough to fertilize the egg without having to compete with the boy sperm who will get there faster.
2. Eat foods that are very acidic. Girl sperm are not harmed by acidic levels and boy sperm usually die off and do better in alkali environments.
3. Use sexual positions that have shallow penetration, such as the missionary, that will leave the boy sperm furthest away from the egg as possible (because they are faster.)
4. It has also been suggested that it is better for the woman to NOT orgasm because it will make the environment more alkali.                 k.fordahl    Answered 1/17/09               52 found this helpful     You can&#39;t control the sex of your baby.

Basically, you are fertile for four days. Use an ovulation test daily for a month so you can see how long you are fertile. The first day (or two) the strip starts to show fertility, you are more likely to get a girl (we did) and the later days when the strip is bold, solid, and dark, more likely to get a boy (we did).

HarkerMommy    Answered 5/28/11               21 found this helpful     A report recently came out that women with high calorie diets, including eating breakfast(cereal), were more likely to conceive boys. And, that women with reduced calorie diets were then more likely to conceive girls. I am not really sure why this would be, since it is the sperm that determines the sex of the baby. Maybe the calories somehow change the womans reproductive tract environment, making it more or less favorable to an x or y sperm? With that being said, Victoria Beckham (who reportedly only eats 900 calories a day) has 3 sons.                 timmy mac mom    Answered 5/3/08               19 found this helpful     Ok my new partner has 2 teen sons and wants a girl so I looked in to all this.

You can try most of the suggestions but please do some research before trying any as some can be harmful to your body and some can reduced your chances of getting pregnant.

Your boy days are during ovulation. The girls will last longer while the males die off) your diet also can make your environment more friendly toward male (eat lots of sodium/potassium rich foods-- potatoes etc.) or female (lots of calcium/magnesium rich foods-- whole grain cereal, green leafy veggies, yogurt, cranberry juice etc) You can also take supplements for calcium &amp; Magnesium to increase your chances. If you take the pH of your vagina before sex (be sure that it is around a pH of 4 for a girl) and also after sex just to be sure that it remains in that acidic pH level. (you can use certain douches, and replens to keep your environment acidic)

She sat down and started talking to us about my pregnancy and we were telling her how we were having a girl and how next time my husband would really like a boy.

 She told us a really sad story about how her husband left her after finding out she was pregnant with a girl and so she did a lot of research on how to conceive a boy in order to get him back. She told us low sodium and low red meat diets will increase your chances for a girl and that when we are trying for a boy to start eating tons of meat and a high sodium diet. Males are dependent on the girl gene. This might just be a old wives tale. But trying anything can help right!?

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!  You'll also want to see: What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?             Gender Odds   What are the odds of having another boy or girl?

Visit our community    Can you really choose the sex of your baby? For as long as we've been making babies , women have been exchanging ideas about how to increase their chances of having either a boy or a girl. Unfortunately there's no medical evidence that any of them actually work!  Having said that, there'll always be a mum who tells you an old wives' tale worked for her. So if you fancy defying the experts and trying to tip the balance towards one sex yourself, why not try some of the suggestions below.   You're more likely to conceive a boy if... You have sex on the day of ovulation , as male sperm are thought to swim faster and reach the egg first. You reach orgasm before your partner, as this releases an alkaline fluid, thought to be more male-sperm friendly than the vagina's natural acidity. You have deep penetration during sex, such as from behind (doggie-style). Your partner has a high sperm count. This is because male sperm are not as strong as female sperm, and so the higher the count, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first. You avoid sex for a week before ovulation and then only have sex once on ovulation day, to keep the sperm count high. Your partner suggested the love-making. You make love at night. You make love on odd days of the month. Your partner keeps his genitals cool by wearing boxer shorts and loose-fitting trousers. You eat salty food, plenty of meat, fish, white flour, pasta, fresh fruit, certain vegetables, but avoid milk and dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, nuts, chocolate, shellfish and wholemeal bread. You're more likely to conceive a girl if... You have sex earlier on in your cycle, a few days before your day of ovulation. This is because female sperm are thought to be stronger and therefore last longer than male sperm, who will die off before reaching the egg. Your partner reaches orgasm before you. You have sex frequently to lower your partner's sperm count, and so increase the chances of the female sperm reaching the egg first. You keep penetration shallow. You stop having unprotected sex four to five days before ovulation, to minimise the chances of the male sperm reaching the egg first. Your partner keeps his genitals warm by wearing close-fitting underwear and tight trousers (although this isn't likely to do his general fertility any good!) You suggested the love-making. You make love in the afternoon. You make love on even days of the month. You put a wooden spoon under your bed and a pink ribbon under your pillow. You drink plenty of milk and eat dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, unsalted foods, rice, pasta, certain vegetables, mineral water, limited amounts of meat and potatoes, but avoid salt and any salty foods, wine and beer, fresh fruit, spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms, chocolate, coffee and tea. Some of these techniques are recommended as part of the Shettles method of sex selection. Find out What the scientists say about this and other methods.    Inside pregnancy: girl or boy?

I have two boys and have been blogging about wanting to have a girl for some time. I had gone through most of the experiences posted by women, like gender dieting, douching etc but they didn't really make any sense to me. Ultimately, I picked Urobiologics (based in the US) who have literally proven that, although gender is 'determined' by sperms, women select the gender of the baby based on the cycle she conceives, by choosing to conceive in the correct alternating cycle. We were given a conception plan to try to conceive in the girl cycle (you send off urine samples to Urobiologics, who will then determine when you will be in a boy or girl cycle). We became pregnant with our girl (we used their post-gender test to check the gender of the baby at around 7 weeks). Sadly our little Poppy girl died at 16 weeks (31 Oct) due to a PPROM, so we are leaving it a couple of months to heal and then go via the PreGender Preconception Test route again. I'm ready now!

They say if the baby is on the right side of the uterus then its a boy, if its on the left side then its a girl.  Here is a link to the study...  hcp.obgyn.net/fetal-monitoring/cont...  So lets test it because I think if it was that accurate it would be more widely discussed.  So if you have a previous LO  (little one) and had an early U/S, go back and look at it and see which side of the uterus its on.  This only works for the vaginal u/s because the ones done on the stomach are opposite sides.  Here is my u/s today for an example, the baby is on the left side, so by this its a girl.  Guess time will tell        --  ~A s h l e y I love Camden, Grayer, DH  and MY KTT GIRLS!

Check Out These 10 Tips Okay, so forget the sugar, spice, slugs and snails. We all know girls and boys are made of sperm and eggs. But if you're trying to conceive one or the other, here are some fun tips to try to tip the scales. For the record, I followed all the tips for a boy and welcomed our second baby girl with open arms last year. It did give me a sense of satisfaction knowing I'd tried though. Did any of these work for you? We want to know!

So don't wait until you ovulate. Use our handy dandy ovulation calculator to help you plan to do the deed two or more days before ovulation. Or you could try The Whelan Method , named after Elizabeth Whelan, author of Boy or Girl, which is basically the opposite approach. The Shettles Method boasts a slightly higher success rate of 75 percent at conceiving the child of choice.

That is supposedly more favorable for Y-chromosome (boy) sperm. Check the ingredients list to be sure you're getting one with only the guaifenesin and not one for multi-cold symptoms.

So it's like giving those faster, male sperm a head start to the finish line. Don't feel cheated though; you'll get yours soon.

So try an alkaline diet a few weeks before conception. Here's an acid/alkaline food chart to get you started. Bumping up your sodium and potassium intake is also suggested for those trying to conceive boys. Start off your morning with a power smoothie with green powder. If nothing else, it will get you healthier, which is great for your pre-baby body.

If only we'd tell you that your chances of conceiving a boy would increase by consuming chocolate while catching up on your Netflix list in your yoga pants too, right? Hit the weights, and focus on strength training because weight loss is said to sway toward baby girls.

The theory is to make dietary changes to alter your body's pH levels a few weeks before trying to conceive. Acidic conditions are said to kill boy sperm. However, this doesn't mean covering your food in lemon and vinegar. Here's an acid/alkaline food chart for reference. Bumping up your calcium and magnesium intake is also suggested.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

What are the signs I'm having a baby girl?  Take our boy or girl quiz      Video Boy or girl? Watch how your baby develops into a boy or girl.  You're bound to be curious about your baby's gender , even if you're waiting until the birth to find out. But what if you could tell just by the season in which you conceived, or by what job your partner has? Folk tales are one thing, but what real-life factors may affect the gender of your baby?  What are the signs I'm having a baby boy? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a boy if:  You and your partner are living together  One large study of 86,000 parents showed that couples who were living together when they conceived were slightly more likely to have a boy (Norberg 2004) .  Just over half (51.5 per cent) of couples living together before conception had a boy, compared with 49.9 per cent of those who lived apart. But why domestic bliss results in more boys is not entirely clear.  You've been living together for less than a year  If your relationship is new and exciting, you'll probably be having lots of sex (Brewis and Meyer 2005) . Frequent sex gives male sperm a slightly bigger advantage than usual.  Male sperm are lighter, have smaller heads, and shorter tails (Jongbloet 2004) . They can swim more easily through the slightly less hospitable fertile mucus , which coincides with the beginning and the end of your fertile window . This includes the time of ovulation (Jongbloet 2004) .  Some experts think that female sperm are more likely to reach the egg in the middle of your fertile period (James 2008) .  By having frequent sex, you are more likely to have sex at the start and end of your fertile window, when male sperm have a slight advantage.  You're feeling stressed  Boys tend to be conceived at times of sustained stress , such as during and following a war (Helle et al 2009, Hohmann et al 2010) .  One theory is that the mum's high stress levels leads to increases in testosterone and cortisol (Grant 2007, Grant and Irwin 2009) . This may lead to changes in the egg, which make it easier for male sperm to penetrate.  Just how this happens isn't clear, but there is still so much we don't know about the exact moment of conception .  You have a higher calorie intake  One study divided 740 British women into groups according to their calorie intake (Mathews et al 2008) . Of the women who had the highest energy intake (about 2,413 calories), 56 per cent had boys. Of the women who had the lowest energy intake (about 2,283 calories), only 45 per cent had boys.  Boys are more fragile and are statistically less likely to be conceived, or to survive pregnancy, when food is short. Girl sperm are more robust, so in harder times they may be more able to survive.  But it's clear that, whether you're having a boy or a girl, a healthy diet is important both before you conceive and during pregnancy .  What are the signs I'm having a baby girl? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a girl if:  You're over 35 years old and the dad-to-be is over 40 years old  The older the mum and dad , the more likely the female sperm are to fertilise the egg (Matsuo et al 2009) . This could be due to hormonal influences in the woman as she ages. And in older dads , the female sperm is more likely to win the race. The quality of sperm deteriorates with age and older men produce fewer male sperm.  Or it could be because we tend to have sex less often (Brewis 2005) as we get older. Also, older couples may be more likely to have sex in the middle of the fertile period, when female sperm may have the edge over male sperm.  You suffer badly from pregnancy sickness  If you have severe pregnancy sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum), you're slightly more likely to have a baby girl.  A review of 13 studies found that 55 per cent of babies born to women who'd had severe pregnancy sickness were girls (Veenendaal et al 2011) . This was compared with 49 per cent in the control group of women who didn't suffer from it. Some experts think that this is due to high levels of the hormone oestrogen, which is linked with pregnancy sickness .  You were born in a tropical climate and conceived there  Fancy a long holiday, somewhere warm?  It's not clear how much time you and your partner would need to spend in a tropical climate for there to be any effect, or if you would need to have been born there, too. But a global survey of birth data showed that more girls are born in the tropics (the region around the equator) than anywhere else in the world (Navara 2009) .  One theory is that the hormone melatonin has an effect. Melatonin causes changes in the reproductive systems of animals in response to the length of the day. More females are born when the days are longer. Or it could be that a high temperature alters the survival of male or female sperm in semen.  Your baby was conceived in the winter  However, in some countries, more girls are conceived in winter, and more boys are conceived in the summer (Cagnacci et al 2003, Melnikov and Grech 2003) . Farmers have noticed this effect in their animals for many years.  This may be because more viral and bacterial infections are around in the winter. As male sperm and embryos are more fragile, girls may be more able to withstand mums catching infections than boys.  Dad-to-be's job involves pollutants or stress  A few studies have looked at the dad's occupation and the ratio of boys and girls born to them. They found that jobs that involve stress or pollutants seem to result in more girls.  Though they were small-scale studies, which only looked at certain occupations, dads with the following jobs resulted in more girls than average:   professional driver (James 2008) deep-sea diver (James 2008) submarine sonar technician (Volk 2004) flour mill worker (Milham and Ossiander 2008) high-performance pilot (James 2008)  You conceived after having your ovulation induced hormonally  Some studies carried out among women who used hormones to induce ovulation, such as clomifene , show that you are slightly more likely to have a girl if artificial hormones are involved (James 2008) . However, other experts aren't convinced.  You already have two or more children  It's possible that the more children you have, the more likely you are to have a girl. This may be due to the fact that the more pregnancies you have, the higher your levels of the hormone gonadotrophin (James 1980) . Some experts have claimed that these higher hormonal levels could be linked to a higher chance of having a girl.  Take our boy or girl quiz  Find out whether you're more likely to have a girl or a boy. Last reviewed: October 2013   References   Brewis A, Meyer M. 2005. Marital coitus across the life course.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

It's in your genes, dad  By Fiona Macrae for the Daily Mail    Updated: 18:28 EDT, 10 December 2008                     View comments          The 'fatherhood gene': Researchers claim a man's chances of having a boy or a girl are decided by his genes  A man's chances of fathering a boy or a girl are written in his genes, research suggests.   Analysis of more than 900 family trees dating back to 1600 has suggested the existence of a ' fatherhood gene' that determines the sex of a man's children.   As men inherit the gene from their parents, males who have lots of brothers are likely to have sons and those with many sisters have high odds of fathering daughters. Corry Gellatly, a research scientist at Newcastle University, analysed the histories of 927 European and American families, comprising more than 500,000 people. The results suggested that a gene controls whether a man's sperm contains more X or Y chromosomes, which in turn determine the sex of his children. A child's sex is determined by the father because a woman's eggs only contain X chromosomes. When one of these combines with a sperm carrying an X chromosome, a girl is created. If it combines with a Y, the result is a boy.    It is thought that the gene comes in three forms. Men that inherit the first produce more Y sperm and have more sons. Those with the second-type produce equal numbers of X and Y sperm and so are as likely to have a boy as a girl. The third form skews the tendency towards daughters, the journal Evolutionary Biology reports. Mr Gellatly said the simple system would help keep the number of boys and girls born roughly equal. He said: 'If there are too many males in the population, for example, females will more easily find a mate, so men who have more daughters will pass on more of their genes, causing more females to be born in later generations.' The theory could also explain why shortly after the First World War an extra two boys were born for every 100 girls in the UK compared with before. Mr Gellatly said the odds were in favour of men with more sons seeing a son return from the war.  The soldiers would have inherited the tendency to have sons and so be more likely to father boys themselves. By contrast, men with more daughters may have lost their only sons in the war.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!  You'll also want to see: What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?             Gender Odds   What are the odds of having another boy or girl?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  Does having boys or girls run in the family?

There are 4 things that increase your chances of having a girl.
1. Have sex from the last day of your period (every day) to just 3 or 4 days before you are ovulating. You can do this with an ovulation kit. Studies have shown that girl sperm live much longer than boy sperm. Doing this will allow the girl sperm to stay alive long enough to fertilize the egg without having to compete with the boy sperm who will get there faster.
2. Eat foods that are very acidic. Girl sperm are not harmed by acidic levels and boy sperm usually die off and do better in alkali environments.
3. Use sexual positions that have shallow penetration, such as the missionary, that will leave the boy sperm furthest away from the egg as possible (because they are faster.)
4. It has also been suggested that it is better for the woman to NOT orgasm because it will make the environment more alkali.                 k.fordahl    Answered 1/17/09               52 found this helpful     You can&#39;t control the sex of your baby.

Basically, you are fertile for four days. Use an ovulation test daily for a month so you can see how long you are fertile. The first day (or two) the strip starts to show fertility, you are more likely to get a girl (we did) and the later days when the strip is bold, solid, and dark, more likely to get a boy (we did). Another post said something like this too in a much more articulated way about the way the girls live longer etc... ;o)                 Jessie Johnson 6806    Answered 7/9/13               25 found this helpful     OH, and NO orgasm for the girl if you want a little princess...                 HarkerMommy    Answered 5/28/11               21 found this helpful     A report recently came out that women with high calorie diets, including eating breakfast(cereal), were more likely to conceive boys. And, that women with reduced calorie diets were then more likely to conceive girls. I am not really sure why this would be, since it is the sperm that determines the sex of the baby. Maybe the calories somehow change the womans reproductive tract environment, making it more or less favorable to an x or y sperm? With that being said, Victoria Beckham (who reportedly only eats 900 calories a day) has 3 sons.                 timmy mac mom    Answered 5/3/08               19 found this helpful     Ok my new partner has 2 teen sons and wants a girl so I looked in to all this. I&#39;m sorry to say that there is no sure way to up the chances of a girl and no provable scientific face. You can try most of the suggestions but please do some research before trying any as some can be harmful to your body and some can reduced your chances of getting pregnant. I love my partner and I know she wants a little girl more than anything but honestly please don&#39;t try anything that may harm your baby&#39;s development           a BabyCenter member   Answered 8/27/16               19 found this helpful     It depends on what kind of foods you are putting in your diet.. along with shallow penetration (have him release as far out as he can without pulling out completely), timing (do it everyday after your period up until 3-4 days before ovulation. Your boy days are during ovulation. The girls will last longer while the males die off) your diet also can make your environment more friendly toward male (eat lots of sodium/potassium rich foods-- potatoes etc.) or female (lots of calcium/magnesium rich foods-- whole grain cereal, green leafy veggies, yogurt, cranberry juice etc) You can also take supplements for calcium &amp; Magnesium to increase your chances. If you take the pH of your vagina before sex (be sure that it is around a pH of 4 for a girl) and also after sex just to be sure that it remains in that acidic pH level. (you can use certain douches, and replens to keep your environment acidic)

Thank you very much.                 saedahigginds    Answered 4/16/17               17 found this helpful     This might be a weird tip but my husband and I ran into an interesting woman on our anniversary in a restaurant. She sat down and started talking to us about my pregnancy and we were telling her how we were having a girl and how next time my husband would really like a boy.

 She told us a really sad story about how her husband left her after finding out she was pregnant with a girl and so she did a lot of research on how to conceive a boy in order to get him back. She told us low sodium and low red meat diets will increase your chances for a girl and that when we are trying for a boy to start eating tons of meat and a high sodium diet. Males are dependent on the girl gene. This might just be a old wives tale. But trying anything can help right!?
