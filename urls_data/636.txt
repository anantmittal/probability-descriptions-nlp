The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

Jul 27, 2011, 06:50pm              MoneyBuilder                 Des Toups  ,         Contributor             Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin                  Gallery  10 Used Cars to Avoid   Launch Gallery  10 images              This post provided by CarInsurance.com  If you haven’t been in a car accident, consider yourself lucky. Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.    But these crashes most likely will be costly. More than 2 million people are injured in crashes every year. In 2010, the average claim for injuries to cover both the insured driver and others involved in the crash had risen to $23,450, thanks in large part to soaring medical costs, according to the Insurance Research Council, a nonprofit research group. (See " The safest ways to get 40 mpg .")  Accidents on the installment plan  Which brings us to why this little-known number is so critical. (We got the accident-every-18-years statistic from the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America , a trade association that analyzes insurance data.)  Insurance companies may sell protection -- and one night of TV advertisements suggests that they do a pretty good job on this front -- but they’re in the game to make a profit. And they don’t make a profit by paying for your accidents. They do so by getting you to pay for your accidents -- in advance.  “You’re paying a smaller portion over a longer period of time,” explains Dee Dee Mays, an actuary with Perr&Knight, an insurance consultancy. “It’s kind of a way to spread your risk.”  How to price your insurance rates low enough to lure you from a competitor, but high enough to make a profit on your future accidents, involves elaborate risk assessments that constitute the secret sauce of the insurance business.  Computer data can now create thousands of driver-profile combinations. But all can be boiled down to the need to determine two things:   How many accidents will occur? Or, put another way, how likely is each driver in each car to have an accident? And,  How much will each accident cost?   You’re already a statistic  How often you're considered due for that next accident depends a little, too, on your insurer. A company that insures large numbers of young drivers – who are far more likely to have accidents -- will likely budget for a shorter gap between crashes. State Farm, the country's largest auto insurance company, has customers with slightly lower-than-average accident rates.  "If we just take collisions, the average State Farm policy holder has a collision claim once every 19 years," says State Farm spokesman Dick Luedke.  But odds are made to be beaten, right?  Many factors are beyond a driver’s immediate control. Clearly you can’t alter road conditions or medical costs, at least by the time your insurance bill is due. That, in the insurance game, makes you a firm stat: a driver paying for the accident he’s expected to have every 17.9 years.  But there are some ways you can move the needle, ways that will both change your lifetime-accident rate and lower your insurance premium.  Assuming that, at least today, you can’t change your age, your driving history, or what kind of car you drive, here are some behaviors you can incorporate to lower your accident risk and, in the end, your insurance rates.  Don’t drive impaired. No single factor is more likely to cause an accident than a driver impaired by alcohol or other drugs. One-third of fatal accidents in this country are attributed to drunken drivers alone.  Don’t drive during the vampire hour. The deadliest three-hour periods on American roadways are between midnight and 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of those fatal crashes, 66% involve alcohol-impaired driving.   Keep your eyes on the road. NHTSA data show that 995 of the 30,797 fatal crashes in 2009 involved drivers using cell phones. Nearly, 5,500 traffic deaths involved a driver distracted by something inside the car, including technology, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation  Don’t speed. Nearly one-third of all fatal accidents are attributed to speeding or driving too fast for conditions. Speeding is the single greatest contributor to accidents other than impaired driving. Insurance companies love such proven risk factors when assessing rates. Anyone who’s seen their premiums skyrocket after getting a ticket knows this well.  Avoid congestion. Less than a quarter of both injury crashes and non-injury crashes in 2009 occurred on roadways with a posted speed limit of 55 mph or higher. Fewer intersections apparently make for fewer crashes. Be careful, though: When accidents do occur on these highways, they are more likely to be deadly, accounting for nearly half of all traffic fatalities.

Insurance companies use various methods to calculate the value of a personal injury claim, which generally includes compensation for actual medical bills and lost wages, coupled with some amount of money for "pain and suffering." This article addresses how to calculate the value of a car accident claim using two common formulas - the multiplier method and the per diem method.  (We also have a calculator that compares the two methods, on this page . Keep in mind the outputs cover pain and suffering only - not the total claim value.)  The Multiplier Method  An often-used method for evaluating pain and suffering damages is to multiple the actual damages (medical bills and lost wages) by a certain number. Many personal injury lawyers have been trained to multiply the actual damages by three to reach a reasonable damages amount. So, if your medical bills were $5,000.00 and your lost wages were $1,000.00, you would multiply $6,000.00 by 3 for a total of $18,000.00.  In recent years, however, insurance companies have become more reluctant to automatically concede that a multiple of three is a reasonable way to quantify pain and suffering damages.  Now, the approach is often to take the actual damages and multiply that amount by a figure that is arrived at through the use of complex software programs, and the result will often undervalue your claim. The multiplier generally depends on the seriousness of your injuries, any aggravating circumstances, and the length of your recovery. For instance, if you suffer a broken femur and undergo multiple surgeries, the pain and suffering you experience is naturally going to be worse than that from a minor fender bender.  So, in the more serious accident, the multiplier might be three or four, whereas in the fender bender, the multiplier might be 1 or 2. The multiplier might be even higher if there are aggravating circumstances, such as the at-fault driver being intoxicated. In that case, you might reasonably use a higher multiplier. Likewise, if your own actions (or inactions) were partly to blame for the accident, it is reasonable to use a lower multiplier to evaluate your compensable pain and suffering.  (For more on this, see Determining a Multiplier to Value Your Personal Injury Case .)  It is also important to consider the type of treatment received in relation to the injuries incurred in choosing a reasonable multiplier. Some injury claimants seek an excessive amount of medical care in relationship to the injury sustained. For instance, one might obtain three or four months of chiropractic care of physical therapy for a minor injury. Insurance companies are usually unwilling to consider excessive medical treatment in their calculation of pain and suffering.  So, don’t keep treating for minor injuries in the hope that this will increase the value of your case. Over-treating injuries can often backfire, leaving you with unpaid medical bills and insufficient compensation.  The Daily Rate Method  Some insurers and personal injury attorneys use a daily rate to calculate the pain and suffering aspect of an injury claim. Under a daily rate or "per diem" calculation, an amount of money is assigned to each day (or week) that you suffer from injury after a car accident.  For example, suppose you incurred medical bills in the amount of $5,000.00 and lost income of $1,000.00 for a total of $6,000.00. For three months after the accident you saw a physician regularly and took daily pain medication. After about three months, the pain eased and you were able to resume normal activities again. You might assign a daily value of $200.00. Under the per diem method, you would multiple 90 days (3 months) by $200.00 to reach $18,000.00.  How do you choose the daily rate? One way might be to rely on the income you would make in a given day if you were not injured. So, if you typically earned $200.00 per day, but were unable to go to work, this might be a reasonable method of valuation.  While it may seem arbitrary to choose a per diem number, you should be able to articulate a legitimate reason for why you chose that amount. This is because when you take your case to a judge or jury, you cannot simply state "my pain and suffering is worth $200.00 per day." Rather, you will need to offer the jury or judge a reason upon which they can base such an award.  Getting a Final Value  Probably the most efficient and systematic way to value your claim is to use both the multiplier and per diem method to get a ballpark figure. From there you need to adjust your expectations based on a variety of factors, such as the severity of your injuries , whether others were involved and injured, the permanence of any injury , whether you were out of work for an extended period of time or laid off as a result of not working, and whether you believe you will make a strong witness on your own behalf.  Applying all these factors together will help you create a reasonable value for your claim. For instance, if your multiplier gives you a value of $18,000.00 and your per diem gives you a value of $30,000.00, you might choose a ballpark figure of $24,000.00. If you suffered a broken bone, underwent surgery, and may have a permanent limp, you should add some amount to your valuation. On the other hand, if you had a sprained wrist and the accident was partly your fault, you should subtract from that $24,000.00 figure.  Once you come up with a number that you're comfortable with as a starting point for settlement negotiations, it's time to craft your demand letter .

Turns out it varies wildly, depending on where you live.   To get an overarching look at how deadly the roads are in all 50 states, plus DC, we combined government data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. (Check out the table at the end to see the raw numbers for yourself.) Here's every state, ranked by how likely you are to be killed in a car crash, plus some other terrifying factoids. Hint: be careful when you're out walking around in Florida.

Washington, DC   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/32,322  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/14,053  Total population: 646,449  Total licensed drivers: 405,555  Total number of deaths in 2013: 20 How is it possible that the city topping our Worst Damn Freeways in America ranking comes in as the least likely place to die in a car? Well, probably because the freeways are so damn awful, people drive less: with an average of 8,697 miles per driver per year, people stay away from the the known horrors of the streets.              50. Massachusetts   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/20,530  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/11,421  Total population: 6,692,824  Total licensed drivers: 4,765,586  Total number of deaths in 2013: 326 With just 1.05 vehicles per licensed driver, Massachusetts has among the fewest cars per capita in the country.    49. New Jersey   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,419  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/7,772  Total population: 8,899,339  Total licensed drivers: 6,081,386  Total number of deaths in 2013: 542 This one really shouldn't be all that surprising, given the number of people who take trains into NYC every day.    48. New York   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,390  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/8,860  Total population: 19,651,127  Total licensed drivers: 11,210,723  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,199 The average New York driver actually drives a little bit more (12,154 miles) than the national average each year, though only 70% of all New Yorkers over the age of 16 actually have a license, and there's less than one car per licensed driver.              47. Rhode Island   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,177  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/9,144  Total population: 1,051,511  Total licensed drivers: 749,232  Total number of deaths in 2013: 65 Despite low overall numbers, a majority of fatal accidents in Rhode Island are single-car collisions.

Washington   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/15,989  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/8,032  Total population: 6,971,406  Total licensed drivers: 5,301,630  Total number of deaths in 2013: 436 Nearly 96% of Washington's of-age population has a license, but they don't drive all that much, averaging 8,949 miles per car.    45. Alaska   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,414  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,870  Total population: 735,132  Total licensed drivers: 528,873  Total number of deaths in 2013: 51 How many miles does the average Alaskan vehicle see in a year? It's 6,169. Of course, that could also be the height in inches of annual snowfall, so there's a reasonably correlative relationship here.              44. Minnesota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,006  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,523  Total population: 5,420,380  Total licensed drivers: 3,330,725  Total number of deaths in 2013: 387 Despite having more roads than all but four states, Minnesotans are among the least likely to get their licenses. Those that do, though, rack up over 17,000 mile per year, and are among the most likely to slam into someone else.    43. Hawaii   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,765  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,951  Total population: 1,404,054  Total licensed drivers: 915,033  Total number of deaths in 2013: 102 Hawaii has the fewest miles of road of any state in the union, and it's also among the roughest. Unsurprisingly, Hawaii has the fewest miles of road per fatal crash (48) of any state.              42. Utah   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,186  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,778  Total population: 2,900,872  Total licensed drivers: 1,661,219  Total number of deaths in 2013: 220 With 16,256 miles per driver, you might expect Utah to have more than 46,254 miles of road. Then again, one of the prime allures of the state is what you can do without roads.                   Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Ilirjan Rrumbullaku      41. Connecticut   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,029  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,672  Total population: 3,596,080  Total licensed drivers: 2,534,090  Total number of deaths in 2013: 276 Most adults in Connecticut have a license, and while they drive almost as much as the national average, one out of every 7,615 registered vehicles will be involved in a fatal accident each year.              40. Illinois   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,999  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,390  Total population: 12,882,135  Total licensed drivers: 8,261,582  Total number of deaths in 2013: 991 Even with the fourth most roads in the country, Illinoisans (Illini?) are actually pretty good about not putting themselves in life-threatening situations.    39. California   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,778  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,063  Total population: 38,332,521  Total licensed drivers: 24,390,236  Total number of deaths in 2013: 3,000 You're not actually better off in the car in California, but with a 1/43,363 chance of getting killed by a car even if you're not in a moving vehicle, it kinda seems like it sometimes.              38. Maryland   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,750  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,480  Total population: 5,928,814  Total licensed drivers: 4,140,105  Total number of deaths in 2013: 465 Cars in Maryland see 14,787 miles each year, despite having just 32,422 miles of road in the state. That probably speaks to the nightmare of commuting from the outskirts of DC more than anything else, but there's still less than one car per driver for the entire state.    37. Oregon   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,556  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,189  Total population: 3,930,065  Total licensed drivers: 2,773,373  Total number of deaths in 2013: 313 Oregon likes to consider itself a bicycle-friendly state, and with just 55 fatalities among people not inside a moving vehicle, there might very well be something to that.

Ohio   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/11,700  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,374  Total population: 11,570,808  Total licensed drivers: 8,030,421  Total number of deaths in 2013: 989 Interestingly, Ohio tied for the highest average number of vehicles per collision, with 1.62. In other words, people in Ohio are statistically less likely to hit stationary objects.    35. Virginia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/11,163  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,813  Total population: 8,260,405  Total licensed drivers: 5,602,765  Total number of deaths in 2013: 740 The average Virginian drives over 14,400 miles each year, though less than 85% of those eligible actually hold a license.              34. Colorado   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,953  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,295  Total population: 5,258,367  Total licensed drivers: 3,837,488  Total number of deaths in 2013: 481 Only three states have more deaths per collision than Colorado, though the reasons for that could be anything from high rates of SUV usage to carpooling.    33. Nevada   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,649  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,947  Total population: 2,790,136  Total licensed drivers: 1,756,095  Total number of deaths in 2013: 262 According to the statistics, there are two things you really don't want to be in Nevada: a pedestrian or a driver. Both have abnormally high death rates, while overall accidents and passenger deaths are pretty average.              32. Wisconsin   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,576  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,925  Total population: 5,742,713  Total licensed drivers: 4,171,427  Total number of deaths in 2013: 543 In somewhat of a paradox, Wisconsin ranks right up there with the best states for fewest deaths per fatality accident, but it's also one of the states with the most cars involved per collision.       related           All 50 States, Ranked by Their Roadside Attractions        related           Every State, Ranked by Its Food                    Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Peter Miller      31. Pennsylvania   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,574  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,095  Total population: 12,773,801  Total licensed drivers: 8,896,590  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,208 Pennsylvania is a vastly different state between its eastern and western halves, and while numbers would probably paint a very different picture between the two, our data doesn't break down like that, and the state averages out to middle of the pack.              30. Michigan   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,449  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,069  Total population: 9,895,622  Total licensed drivers: 6,986,587  Total number of deaths in 2013: 947 Michigan is nearly 30% smaller than Pennsylvania by population, and while the statistics bear that out across most categories, Michiganders actually drive almost as many total miles as their Big Ten neighbors.    29. New Hampshire   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,803  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,805  Total population: 1,323,459  Total licensed drivers: 1,061,433  Total number of deaths in 2013: 135 A total of 97.6% of all legal-age New Hampshirites hold a valid driver's license. They combine for among the fewest cars involved per accident of any state. Which means a lot of single car accidents, and collisions with stationary objects. Go figure?              28. Iowa   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,749  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,867  Total population: 3,090,416  Total licensed drivers: 2,143,665  Total number of deaths in 2013: 317 Iowans have more cars per driver than all but three other states, but despite being so car-heavy, it's the third safest state for pedestrians.    27. Delaware   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,351  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,208  Total population: 925,749  Total licensed drivers: 723,657  Total number of deaths in 2013: 99 All things considered, Delaware is relatively safe for drivers, though it's one of the more dangerous states for pedestrian traffic.

Maine   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,161  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,901  Total population: 1,328,302  Total licensed drivers: 1,011,385  Total number of deaths in 2013: 145 Ninety-two percent of Maine's residents hold a license, averaging just under 14,000 miles per year.              25. Vermont   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,082  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,973  Total population: 636,630  Total licensed drivers: 543,057  Total number of deaths in 2013: 69 Amazingly, Vermont has more licensed drivers than residents over the age of 16. It also has a disproportionately large number of passenger fatalities along its 14,266 miles of road.    24. Nebraska   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,856  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,089  Total population: 1,868,516  Total licensed drivers: 1,374,529  Total number of deaths in 2013: 211 Nebraska's pedestrians are among the safest in the country, with fewer than one out of every 100,000 residents struck each year.              23. Georgia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,475  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3,987  Total population: 9,992,167  Total licensed drivers: 6,607,016  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,179 Georgians put, on average, 14,055 miles on each car every year. Just two states top that, which makes Georgia's fatal crash-per-mile rate actually fairly good.    22. Indiana   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,392  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,004  Total population: 6,570,902  Total licensed drivers: 4,500,403  Total number of deaths in 2013: 783 Indiana's drivers actually average more miles per year than Georgia's, but they own more cars, too, with nearly one and a quarter per driver.

Florida   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,123  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3.972  Total population: 19,552,860  Total licensed drivers: 13,670,441  Total number of deaths in 2013: 2,407 If you're not in a moving vehicle, you have a 1 in 29,627 chance of being killed by a car in Florida. The 660 people to meet such a fate in 2013 were by far the most in the US.              19. Missouri   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/7,984  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3,835  Total population: 6,044,171  Total licensed drivers: 4,280,438  Total number of deaths in 2013: 757 Just over 1,000 cars were involved in a deadly crash in Missouri, according to the government.    18.

Idaho   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/7,533  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3,723  Total population: 1,612,136  Total licensed drivers: 1,111,485  Total number of deaths in 2013: 214 There are just over 48,000 miles of roads in Idaho, which means there's just one death for every 225 miles; that's among the better rates in the Union.    14. Kentucky   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/6,889  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3,464  Total population: 4,395,295  Total licensed drivers: 3,019,283  Total number of deaths in 2013: 638 The average car in Kentucky sees fewer than 12,000 miles per year, while the average driver sees more than 15,500.              13.

South Carolina   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/6,225  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3,175  Total population: 4,744,839  Total licensed drivers: 3,536,404  Total number of deaths in 2013: 767 Nearly 93% of South Carolinians hold a license, but that's not much solace to pedestrians, who fare only marginally better than Arizona and Florida.    7.

Oklahoma   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/5,679  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,547  Total population: 3,850,568  Total licensed drivers: 2,418,307  Total number of deaths in 2013: 678 Cause, meet effect: Oklahoma has a crash-per-mile rate that’s roughly in line with the other states in the top 10, but because OK drivers put so many miles on their car, they’re the second most likely to die in a crash. Simply put, it's because the average Oklahoman drives so much every year that death rate for drivers is the second highest in the country.              5. Alabama   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/5,673  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,889  Total population: 4,833,722  Total licensed drivers: 3,859,403  Total number of deaths in 2013: 852 Along with Virginia, Alabama is unusual in having more licensed drivers than residents over the age of 16.    4. West Virginia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/5,585  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,840  Total population: 1,854,304  Total licensed drivers: 1,177,136  Total number of deaths in 2013: 332 Only Texas, New York, and Washington DC have lower rates of licensed drivers.    3. North Dakota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/4,888  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,436  Total population: 723,393  Total licensed drivers: 513,838  Total number of deaths in 2013: 148 Good news and bad news for North Dakotans: pedestrians are far less likely to get hit in ND than any other state, and it's not even close. That said, drivers are most likely to die here, with one out of every 4,392 running out of luck, and one out of every 2,390 being involved in a crash that claimed a life.              2. Mississippi   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/4,880  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,516  Total population: 2,991,207  Total licensed drivers: 1,968,907  Total number of deaths in 2013: 613 Mississippians put 18,692 miles on the average vehicle, which is the most in the US by a wide margin. Then again, only Maryland, New York, and DC have fewer cars per driver.                   Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Jimmy Emerson      1. Montana   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/4,433  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,302  Total population: 1,015,165  Total licensed drivers: 766,716  Total number of deaths in 2013: 229 Montana has the most cars per driver at just over two, and the second-highest number of deaths per fatality crash, behind New Mexico. Yet somehow, with just 1.31 vehicles involved per collision, it's the state where drivers are most likely to hit stationary objects. And yes, that also means it's on par with Florida for hitting pedestrians.                         Share on Facebook      Pin it        Aaron Miller/Thrillist     About the data  The data used here is from both the NHTSA's Fatal Accident Reporting System , and the FHWA .    The ranking itself is actually very basic: it's the total population of each state divided by the number of people killed in automotive accidents for the given year (2013).   The rest of the data involved, however, is where things get interesting:    Being Involved in a fatal crash : The NHTSA keeps such thorough accounts of every fatality accident that we know exactly how many people were in each vehicle for every single crash. Since surviving such an incident is inarguably a horrific and traumatizing experience, dividing the total population by the number of crashes is a sobering way to realize just how fragile life can be.    Being involved, as a driver: Simply put, the more you drive, the higher your chances of being involved in an incident. We took the population of licensed drivers and divided by the total number of accidents.              Dying in a crash, as a driver: Similar to being involved in a crash, because the NHTSA actually notes who was injured or killed while sitting where in a vehicle, we were able to calculate the odds of dying as a driver by dividing the licensed population by the number of people who died while driving.    Dying while you're not even in a moving vehicle: This includes pedestrians, bicyclists, people inside buildings that get driven into, and parked cars. Basically, anyone who's not out in traffic in a vehicle. As you might expect, it's the total population divided by the number of people who were struck and killed.    There are some problems with the data: While the statistics clearly show a trend toward safer urban driving, they are skewed in areas with well-developed mass transit. The percentage of people who have a license and don't drive is not accounted for in the data, and would potentially skew a few areas where car use is less prevalent.              Closing thoughts  It's more than a little somber to realize that every one of these numbers was caused by the death of someone's spouse, parent, or child. Still, the data is fairly conclusive that rural driving is far more likely to kill you than urban driving -- and the FHWA has the specific breakdowns of this on its site . This data didn't look into exactly why that is, but issues like proximity to first-rate medical care and vehicle speed -- since you're not crawling along in traffic -- are likely greater factors in rural areas.   Interestingly, the number of vehicles per crash doesn't appear to bear significant correlation to how many people die in each crash. Presumably, that number is more dependent on other factors (weather, intoxication, time of day), than it is on the violence of the collision itself.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

Many people die as a result of car accidents, with many more receiving serious injuries. Such injuries and death often leave the victims and their families devastated. Here are some car accident statistics, which might be helpful in making people aware about trends in car accidents, and thus hopefully reducing the number of car accidents in the United States.  On an average, there are more than 6 million car accidents on the roads of the US, annually.  More than 3 million people get injured due to car accidents, with more than 2 million of these injuries being permanent.  There are in excess of 40,000 deaths due to car accidents every year. Although this is a very high number by itself, some heart can be taken in the fact that statistics show that car accident fatalities have been witnessing a downward trend in recent years.  The majority of car accidents could be avoided  if only the drivers would drive more responsibly. About 40% of car accident fatalities occur because of a drunken driver. About 30% of the car accident fatalities can be attributed to driving above the speed limits and 33% and above because of reckless driving that causes the car to go off the road and result in an accident.  The majority of car accident victims are the drivers, then the passengers of the car, followed by pedestrians, and lastly cyclists.  Every 12 minutes, one person dies because of a car accident. Every 14 seconds, a car accident results in an injured victim.  For those in the age group of 1 to 30 years, the leading cause of death is due to being involved in a car accident. People, who are between 15 to 24 years, and those who are above 75 years of age, are the people who are most severely affected by car accidents.  According to the car accident statistics released by the United States Department of Transportation’s (USDOT’s) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there were almost 43,000 deaths in 2002 because of car accidents. The car accident fatalities for the year 2003 stand at 42,643.  In 2002, there were around 6,316,000 car accidents in the US, with these causing about 2.9 million injuries. In 2003, the total number of car accidents was 6,328,000 and the resulting injuries stood at almost 3 million.  More than 25% of all car drivers were involved in car accidents in a five year period.  In more than half of all car accident fatalities, the deceased were found not to be wearing their seat belts at the time of the crash. Even with seat belts being mandatory, a vast majority of people choose to disregard this safety precaution and end up losing their lives because of it.  Many car accidents are caused by people talking to other passengers while driving, and others due to drivers playing with the radio while driving. A large percentage is because of eating or drinking while driving, and 25% of car accidents are caused due to talking on the mobile phone while at the wheel of the car. These car accident statistics are sad enough on their own, the saddest part being that they could have easily been avoided had drivers been paying more attention to driving and less to other activities.

Or overdue. Continue Reading Below By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That&apos;s if you&apos;re an average driver, which, whether you&apos;re willing to admit it or not, you likely are. So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you&apos;ll experience some kind of crash by the time you&apos;re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents. Chances are these crashes won&apos;t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities. But these crashes most likely will be costly. More than 2 million people are injured in crashes every year. In 2010, the average claim for injuries to cover both the insured driver and others involved in the crash had risen to $23,450, thanks in large part to soaring medical costs, according to the Insurance Research Council, a nonprofit research group. More On This... Eight Extreme Cases of Insurance Fraud How Much Car Insurance is Enough? Advertisement [Let CarInsurance.com help you find affordable auto insurance now.] Accidents on the installment plan Which brings us to why this little-known number is so critical. (We got the accident-every-18-years statistic from the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, a trade association that analyzes insurance data.) Insurance companies may sell protection -- and one night of TV advertisements suggests that they do a pretty good job on this front -- but they&apos;re in the game to make a profit. And they don&apos;t make a profit by paying for your accidents. They do so by getting you to pay for your accidents -- in advance. You&apos;re paying a smaller portion over a longer period of time, explains Dee Dee Mays, an actuary with Perr&Knight, an insurance consultancy. It&apos;s kind of a way to spread your risk. How to price your insurance rates low enough to lure you from a competitor, but high enough to make a profit on your future accidents, involves elaborate risk assessments that constitute the secret sauce of the insurance business. But all can be boiled down to the need to determine two things: *How many accidents will occur? Or, put another way, how likely is each driver in each car to have an accident? And, *How much will each accident cost? You&apos;re already a statistic How often you&apos;re considered due for that next accident depends a little, too, on your insurer. A company that insures large numbers of young drivers - who are far more likely to have accidents -- will likely budget for a shorter gap between crashes. State Farm, the country&apos;s largest auto insurance company, has customers with slightly lower-than-average accident rates. "If we just take collisions, the average State Farm policy holder has a collision claim once every 19 years," says State Farm spokesman Dick Luedke. But odds are made to be beaten, right? Many factors are beyond a driver&apos;s immediate control. Clearly you can&apos;t alter road conditions or medical costs, at least by the time your insurance bill is due. That, in the insurance game, makes you a firm stat: a driver paying for the accident he&apos;s expected to have every 17.9 years. But there are some ways you can move the needle, ways that will both change your lifetime-accident rate and lower your insurance premium. Assuming that, at least today, you can&apos;t change your age, your driving history, or what kind of car you drive, here are some behaviors you can incorporate to lower your accident risk and, in the end, your insurance rates. Don&apos;t drive impaired. No single factor is more likely to cause an accident than a driver impaired by alcohol or other drugs. One-third of fatal accidents in this country are attributed to drunken drivers alone. Don&apos;t drive during the vampire hour. The deadliest three-hour periods on American roadways are between midnight and 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of those fatal crashes, 66% involve alcohol-impaired driving. Keep your eyes on the road. NHTSA data show that 995 of the 30,797 fatal crashes in 2009 involved drivers using cell phones. Nearly, 5,500 traffic deaths involved a driver distracted by something inside the car, including technology, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Don&apos;t speed. Nearly one-third of all fatal accidents are attributed to speeding or driving too fast for conditions. Speeding is the single greatest contributor to accidents other than impaired driving. Insurance companies love such proven risk factors when assessing rates. Anyone who&apos;s seen their premiums skyrocket after getting a ticket knows this well. Avoid congestion. Less than a quarter of both injury crashes and non-injury crashes in 2009 occurred on roadways with a posted speed limit of 55 mph or higher. Fewer intersections apparently make for fewer crashes. Be careful, though: When accidents do occur on these highways, they are more likely to be deadly, accounting for nearly half of all traffic fatalities.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

According to the National Safety Council, your odds of dying of various causes are:   Heart disease, 1 in 6  Cancer, 1 in 7  Stroke, 1 in 28  Motor vehicle accidents, 1 in 88  Intentional self-harm, 1 in 112  Accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances, 1 in 130  Falls, 1 in 171  Car crashes, 1 in 303  Assault by firearm, 1 in 306  Pedestrian, 1 in 649  Motorcycle rider, 1 in 770  Accidental drowning, 1 in 1,123  Exposure to smoke, fire, 1 in 1,177  Pedalcyclist 1 in 4,717  Firearms discharge, 1 in 6,309  Air and space transport accidents, 1 in 7,032  Electrocution, 1 in 9,943  Excessive natural heat, 1 in 12,517  Cataclysmic storm, 1 in 46,044  Lightning, 1 in 84,079  Legal execution, 1 in 96,691  Dog attack, 1 in 120,864  Earthquake or other ground movement, 1 in 148,756  Flood, 1 in 175,803  Fireworks discharge, 1 in 386,766                         Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                                Toggle navigation        AllLaw      Find a Lawyer   Legal Forms   Law Topics    Call Us: 800-340-2909          Search     Search Type   All  Products  Lawyers  Articles       Search Term     Location              Home Legal Information Car Accidents     How to Determine Pain and Suffering in a Car Accident Case    Figuring out how much pain and suffering compensation to ask for is a key issue in your case.    by Amanda Naprawa      Share on Google Plus       Share on Facebook                       If you're making an injury claim after a car accident, you're probably wondering what your claim is actually worth. Insurance companies use various methods to calculate the value of a personal injury claim, which generally includes compensation for actual medical bills and lost wages, coupled with some amount of money for "pain and suffering." This article addresses how to calculate the value of a car accident claim using two common formulas - the multiplier method and the per diem method.  (We also have a calculator that compares the two methods, on this page . Keep in mind the outputs cover pain and suffering only - not the total claim value.)  The Multiplier Method  An often-used method for evaluating pain and suffering damages is to multiple the actual damages (medical bills and lost wages) by a certain number. Many personal injury lawyers have been trained to multiply the actual damages by three to reach a reasonable damages amount. So, if your medical bills were $5,000.00 and your lost wages were $1,000.00, you would multiply $6,000.00 by 3 for a total of $18,000.00.  In recent years, however, insurance companies have become more reluctant to automatically concede that a multiple of three is a reasonable way to quantify pain and suffering damages.  Now, the approach is often to take the actual damages and multiply that amount by a figure that is arrived at through the use of complex software programs, and the result will often undervalue your claim. The multiplier generally depends on the seriousness of your injuries, any aggravating circumstances, and the length of your recovery. For instance, if you suffer a broken femur and undergo multiple surgeries, the pain and suffering you experience is naturally going to be worse than that from a minor fender bender.  So, in the more serious accident, the multiplier might be three or four, whereas in the fender bender, the multiplier might be 1 or 2. The multiplier might be even higher if there are aggravating circumstances, such as the at-fault driver being intoxicated. In that case, you might reasonably use a higher multiplier. Likewise, if your own actions (or inactions) were partly to blame for the accident, it is reasonable to use a lower multiplier to evaluate your compensable pain and suffering.  (For more on this, see Determining a Multiplier to Value Your Personal Injury Case .)  It is also important to consider the type of treatment received in relation to the injuries incurred in choosing a reasonable multiplier. Some injury claimants seek an excessive amount of medical care in relationship to the injury sustained. For instance, one might obtain three or four months of chiropractic care of physical therapy for a minor injury. Insurance companies are usually unwilling to consider excessive medical treatment in their calculation of pain and suffering.  So, don’t keep treating for minor injuries in the hope that this will increase the value of your case. Over-treating injuries can often backfire, leaving you with unpaid medical bills and insufficient compensation.  The Daily Rate Method  Some insurers and personal injury attorneys use a daily rate to calculate the pain and suffering aspect of an injury claim. Under a daily rate or "per diem" calculation, an amount of money is assigned to each day (or week) that you suffer from injury after a car accident.  For example, suppose you incurred medical bills in the amount of $5,000.00 and lost income of $1,000.00 for a total of $6,000.00. For three months after the accident you saw a physician regularly and took daily pain medication. After about three months, the pain eased and you were able to resume normal activities again. You might assign a daily value of $200.00. Under the per diem method, you would multiple 90 days (3 months) by $200.00 to reach $18,000.00.  How do you choose the daily rate? One way might be to rely on the income you would make in a given day if you were not injured. So, if you typically earned $200.00 per day, but were unable to go to work, this might be a reasonable method of valuation.  While it may seem arbitrary to choose a per diem number, you should be able to articulate a legitimate reason for why you chose that amount. This is because when you take your case to a judge or jury, you cannot simply state "my pain and suffering is worth $200.00 per day." Rather, you will need to offer the jury or judge a reason upon which they can base such an award.  Getting a Final Value  Probably the most efficient and systematic way to value your claim is to use both the multiplier and per diem method to get a ballpark figure. From there you need to adjust your expectations based on a variety of factors, such as the severity of your injuries , whether others were involved and injured, the permanence of any injury , whether you were out of work for an extended period of time or laid off as a result of not working, and whether you believe you will make a strong witness on your own behalf.  Applying all these factors together will help you create a reasonable value for your claim. For instance, if your multiplier gives you a value of $18,000.00 and your per diem gives you a value of $30,000.00, you might choose a ballpark figure of $24,000.00. If you suffered a broken bone, underwent surgery, and may have a permanent limp, you should add some amount to your valuation. On the other hand, if you had a sprained wrist and the accident was partly your fault, you should subtract from that $24,000.00 figure.  Once you come up with a number that you're comfortable with as a starting point for settlement negotiations, it's time to craft your demand letter .

Turns out it varies wildly, depending on where you live.   To get an overarching look at how deadly the roads are in all 50 states, plus DC, we combined government data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. (Check out the table at the end to see the raw numbers for yourself.) Here's every state, ranked by how likely you are to be killed in a car crash, plus some other terrifying factoids. Hint: be careful when you're out walking around in Florida.

Well, probably because the freeways are so damn awful, people drive less: with an average of 8,697 miles per driver per year, people stay away from the the known horrors of the streets.              50.

It's 6,169. Of course, that could also be the height in inches of annual snowfall, so there's a reasonably correlative relationship here.              44. Minnesota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,006  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,523  Total population: 5,420,380  Total licensed drivers: 3,330,725  Total number of deaths in 2013: 387 Despite having more roads than all but four states, Minnesotans are among the least likely to get their licenses. Those that do, though, rack up over 17,000 mile per year, and are among the most likely to slam into someone else.    43.

Simply put, it's because the average Oklahoman drives so much every year that death rate for drivers is the second highest in the country.              5.

That said, drivers are most likely to die here, with one out of every 4,392 running out of luck, and one out of every 2,390 being involved in a crash that claimed a life.              2.

Yet somehow, with just 1.31 vehicles involved per collision, it's the state where drivers are most likely to hit stationary objects. And yes, that also means it's on par with Florida for hitting pedestrians.                         Share on Facebook      Pin it        Aaron Miller/Thrillist     About the data  The data used here is from both the NHTSA's Fatal Accident Reporting System , and the FHWA .    The ranking itself is actually very basic: it's the total population of each state divided by the number of people killed in automotive accidents for the given year (2013).   The rest of the data involved, however, is where things get interesting:    Being Involved in a fatal crash : The NHTSA keeps such thorough accounts of every fatality accident that we know exactly how many people were in each vehicle for every single crash. Since surviving such an incident is inarguably a horrific and traumatizing experience, dividing the total population by the number of crashes is a sobering way to realize just how fragile life can be.    Being involved, as a driver: Simply put, the more you drive, the higher your chances of being involved in an incident. We took the population of licensed drivers and divided by the total number of accidents.              Dying in a crash, as a driver: Similar to being involved in a crash, because the NHTSA actually notes who was injured or killed while sitting where in a vehicle, we were able to calculate the odds of dying as a driver by dividing the licensed population by the number of people who died while driving.    Dying while you're not even in a moving vehicle: This includes pedestrians, bicyclists, people inside buildings that get driven into, and parked cars. Basically, anyone who's not out in traffic in a vehicle. As you might expect, it's the total population divided by the number of people who were struck and killed.    There are some problems with the data: While the statistics clearly show a trend toward safer urban driving, they are skewed in areas with well-developed mass transit. The percentage of people who have a license and don't drive is not accounted for in the data, and would potentially skew a few areas where car use is less prevalent.              Closing thoughts  It's more than a little somber to realize that every one of these numbers was caused by the death of someone's spouse, parent, or child. Still, the data is fairly conclusive that rural driving is far more likely to kill you than urban driving -- and the FHWA has the specific breakdowns of this on its site . This data didn't look into exactly why that is, but issues like proximity to first-rate medical care and vehicle speed -- since you're not crawling along in traffic -- are likely greater factors in rural areas.   Interestingly, the number of vehicles per crash doesn't appear to bear significant correlation to how many people die in each crash. Presumably, that number is more dependent on other factors (weather, intoxication, time of day), than it is on the violence of the collision itself.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

Many people die as a result of car accidents, with many more receiving serious injuries. Such injuries and death often leave the victims and their families devastated. Here are some car accident statistics, which might be helpful in making people aware about trends in car accidents, and thus hopefully reducing the number of car accidents in the United States.  On an average, there are more than 6 million car accidents on the roads of the US, annually.  More than 3 million people get injured due to car accidents, with more than 2 million of these injuries being permanent.  There are in excess of 40,000 deaths due to car accidents every year. Although this is a very high number by itself, some heart can be taken in the fact that statistics show that car accident fatalities have been witnessing a downward trend in recent years.  The majority of car accidents could be avoided  if only the drivers would drive more responsibly. About 40% of car accident fatalities occur because of a drunken driver. About 30% of the car accident fatalities can be attributed to driving above the speed limits and 33% and above because of reckless driving that causes the car to go off the road and result in an accident.  The majority of car accident victims are the drivers, then the passengers of the car, followed by pedestrians, and lastly cyclists.  Every 12 minutes, one person dies because of a car accident. Every 14 seconds, a car accident results in an injured victim.  For those in the age group of 1 to 30 years, the leading cause of death is due to being involved in a car accident. People, who are between 15 to 24 years, and those who are above 75 years of age, are the people who are most severely affected by car accidents.  According to the car accident statistics released by the United States Department of Transportation’s (USDOT’s) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there were almost 43,000 deaths in 2002 because of car accidents. The car accident fatalities for the year 2003 stand at 42,643.  In 2002, there were around 6,316,000 car accidents in the US, with these causing about 2.9 million injuries. In 2003, the total number of car accidents was 6,328,000 and the resulting injuries stood at almost 3 million.  More than 25% of all car drivers were involved in car accidents in a five year period.  In more than half of all car accident fatalities, the deceased were found not to be wearing their seat belts at the time of the crash. Even with seat belts being mandatory, a vast majority of people choose to disregard this safety precaution and end up losing their lives because of it.  Many car accidents are caused by people talking to other passengers while driving, and others due to drivers playing with the radio while driving. A large percentage is because of eating or drinking while driving, and 25% of car accidents are caused due to talking on the mobile phone while at the wheel of the car. These car accident statistics are sad enough on their own, the saddest part being that they could have easily been avoided had drivers been paying more attention to driving and less to other activities.

So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you&apos;ll experience some kind of crash by the time you&apos;re 34, at the latest.

But these crashes most likely will be costly. More than 2 million people are injured in crashes every year. In 2010, the average claim for injuries to cover both the insured driver and others involved in the crash had risen to $23,450, thanks in large part to soaring medical costs, according to the Insurance Research Council, a nonprofit research group. More On This... Eight Extreme Cases of Insurance Fraud How Much Car Insurance is Enough? Advertisement [Let CarInsurance.com help you find affordable auto insurance now.] Accidents on the installment plan Which brings us to why this little-known number is so critical. (We got the accident-every-18-years statistic from the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, a trade association that analyzes insurance data.) Insurance companies may sell protection -- and one night of TV advertisements suggests that they do a pretty good job on this front -- but they&apos;re in the game to make a profit. And they don&apos;t make a profit by paying for your accidents. They do so by getting you to pay for your accidents -- in advance. You&apos;re paying a smaller portion over a longer period of time, explains Dee Dee Mays, an actuary with Perr&Knight, an insurance consultancy. It&apos;s kind of a way to spread your risk. How to price your insurance rates low enough to lure you from a competitor, but high enough to make a profit on your future accidents, involves elaborate risk assessments that constitute the secret sauce of the insurance business. But all can be boiled down to the need to determine two things: *How many accidents will occur? Or, put another way, how likely is each driver in each car to have an accident? And, *How much will each accident cost? You&apos;re already a statistic How often you&apos;re considered due for that next accident depends a little, too, on your insurer. A company that insures large numbers of young drivers - who are far more likely to have accidents -- will likely budget for a shorter gap between crashes. State Farm, the country&apos;s largest auto insurance company, has customers with slightly lower-than-average accident rates. "If we just take collisions, the average State Farm policy holder has a collision claim once every 19 years," says State Farm spokesman Dick Luedke. But odds are made to be beaten, right? Many factors are beyond a driver&apos;s immediate control. Clearly you can&apos;t alter road conditions or medical costs, at least by the time your insurance bill is due. That, in the insurance game, makes you a firm stat: a driver paying for the accident he&apos;s expected to have every 17.9 years. But there are some ways you can move the needle, ways that will both change your lifetime-accident rate and lower your insurance premium. Assuming that, at least today, you can&apos;t change your age, your driving history, or what kind of car you drive, here are some behaviors you can incorporate to lower your accident risk and, in the end, your insurance rates. Don&apos;t drive impaired. No single factor is more likely to cause an accident than a driver impaired by alcohol or other drugs. One-third of fatal accidents in this country are attributed to drunken drivers alone. Don&apos;t drive during the vampire hour. The deadliest three-hour periods on American roadways are between midnight and 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of those fatal crashes, 66% involve alcohol-impaired driving. Keep your eyes on the road. NHTSA data show that 995 of the 30,797 fatal crashes in 2009 involved drivers using cell phones. Nearly, 5,500 traffic deaths involved a driver distracted by something inside the car, including technology, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Don&apos;t speed. Nearly one-third of all fatal accidents are attributed to speeding or driving too fast for conditions. Speeding is the single greatest contributor to accidents other than impaired driving. Insurance companies love such proven risk factors when assessing rates. Anyone who&apos;s seen their premiums skyrocket after getting a ticket knows this well. Avoid congestion. Less than a quarter of both injury crashes and non-injury crashes in 2009 occurred on roadways with a posted speed limit of 55 mph or higher. Fewer intersections apparently make for fewer crashes. Be careful, though: When accidents do occur on these highways, they are more likely to be deadly, accounting for nearly half of all traffic fatalities.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.
