Red outline shows previously designated Zika active transmission (red) areas. Yellow outline shows previously designated Zika cautionary (yellow) areas.    CDC previously issued guidance related to Zika for people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County, Florida, which advised that pregnant women not travel to this area due to local transmission of Zika virus. CDC designates areas for Zika virus transmission prevention in the continental United States and Hawaii as red or yellow . Miami-Dade County was previously designated as a Zika cautionary (yellow) area, but that designation was removed on June 2, 2017. This means that there are no longer any travel recommendations related to Zika virus for Miami-Dade County, Florida. Although the level of risk of Zika virus transmission after a yellow area is removed is not known, it is likely to be low. However, sporadic cases may still occur. For this reason, CDC recommends that people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County continue to protect themselves from mosquito-borne illnesses, including Zika virus, by following the guidance below. See CDC’s travel, testing, and pregnancy planning guidance for areas with reported mosquito-borne spread of Zika virus.  Hurricanes and mosquitoes   Learn more about mosquitoes and hurricanes .   Travel   Because Miami-Dade County is no longer a yellow area, there are no recommendations to avoid travel to this area.   Prevention   Women and men who live in or travel to Miami-Dade County should remain aware of any new reports of Zika virus transmission in their area and should follow steps to prevent mosquito bites to reduce their risk for illnesses spread by mosquitoes, including Zika virus.  Because Zika virus can persist for months in semen, there may still be a continuing risk for sexual transmission, whether or not the partner had symptoms of Zika. Pregnant women and their partners who live in or travel to Miami-Dade County who want to reduce their risk of Zika virus infection should use condoms every time they have sex (including vaginal, anal, and oral sex), or they should not have sex during the pregnancy.  Women who are not pregnant and men who live in or travel to these areas who want to reduce their risk of Zika virus infection should consider using condoms every time they have sex, or not having sex.  Men should consider condom use for at least 6 months, and women should consider having sex with a condom for at least 8 weeks from June 2, 2017.   Testing and Diagnosis   Anyone who lived in, traveled to, or had sex without a condom with someone who lived in or traveled to Miami-Dade County between August 1, 2016, and June 2, 2017, who has signs and symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease should be tested.  CDC recommendations for pregnant women can be found in the updated MMWR report .  The state of Florida may take into account the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission and other epidemiologic considerations (e.g., seasonality and mosquito surveillance and control factors) and, therefore, might include a routine recommendation to test asymptomatic pregnant women either for clinical care or as part of Zika virus infection surveillance. Healthcare providers should contact their state health department for state specific guidance .   Pregnancy Planning   People living in Miami-Dade County should talk to their healthcare provider about pregnancy plans. Although the level of Zika virus transmission is likely to be low, sporadic cases may still occur. In addition, couples should consider the possible resurgence of active transmission of Zika virus during the next mosquito season in their pregnancy planning.  Men who traveled to Miami-Dade County between August 1, 2016, and June 2, 2017 should consider waiting at least 6 months after their last possible exposure to this area before attempting to conceive with their partner.  Women who traveled to Miami-Dade County between August 1, 2016, and June 2, 2017 should consider waiting at least 8 weeks after their last possible exposure to this area before attempting to conceive with their partner.  If both male and female partners of a couple traveled together to Miami-Dade County between August 1, 2016, and June 2, 2017, they should consider waiting at least 6 months after their last possible exposure to this area before attempting to conceive.  Limited data are available about the persistence of Zika in body fluids and the chances of harm to a pregnancy when the woman is infected with Zika around the time of conception. Some couples with a partner with possible Zika virus exposure may choose to wait longer or shorter than the recommended period to try to get pregnant. For more information, see CDC’s travel, testing, and pregnancy planning guidance for areas with reported mosquito-borne spread of Zika virus.   Previous Zika active transmission areas (Red areas) and Zika cautionary areas (Yellow areas)  Because the yellow area designation was removed on June 2, 2017, the guidance shown above now applies to all of Miami-Dade County that had previously been designated as red or yellow areas. Women and men living in or who traveled to these areas should be aware that these locations were considered to have Zika virus spread previously. Although the level of risk of Zika virus transmission after a yellow area designation is removed is unknown, it is likely to be low. This information reflects the current situation in Miami-Dade County, Florida. CDC will provide updates if the situation changes.  Timeline  On June 2, 2017, CDC removed the yellow area designation for Miami-Dade County. The yellow area designation was lifted because criteria identified in CDC’s Zika Interim Response Plan had been met: more than three mosquito incubation periods (45 days) passed with no additional confirmed local transmission cases and no suspected local transmission cases under investigation with enhanced surveillance in place.  On December 9, 2016, CDC removed the red area designation for the remaining 1.5-square-mile area of South Miami Beach after three mosquito incubation periods (45 days) passed without any new locally transmitted cases of Zika. Guidance for yellow areas now applies to the South Miami Beach area and all of Miami-Dade County.  On December 2, 2016, CDC removed the red area designation for the 1-square-mile area of Little River after more than three mosquito incubation periods (45 days) passed without any new locally transmitted cases of Zika. Guidance for yellow areas now applies to the Little River area.  On November 21, 2016, CDC updated guidance for the 4.5-square-mile area of Miami Beach. The North and South Miami Beach sections are being considered separately again because no new cases of local Zika virus transmission were identified in the North Miami Beach area after three mosquito incubation periods passed (45 days), suggesting that the risk of Zika virus infection in North Miami Beach is no longer greater than in the rest of Miami-Dade County. The original 1.5-square-mile area of South Miami Beach for which guidance was issued on September 17 will remain a red area until 45 days pass without new cases. The remainder of Miami-Dade County is designated as a Zika cautionary area ( yellow area ). Guidance for yellow areas now applies to North Miami Beach.  On October 19, because local spread of Zika virus continued to be reported in Miami-Dade County, CDC updated its travel and testing guidance to apply recommendations to all of Miami-Dade County.  On October 13, Florida announced a new area of mosquito-borne spread of Zika in an additional 1-square-mile area of Little River in Miami-Dade County, FL.  On September 19, CDC updated guidance for the Wynwood-designated area after three mosquito incubation periods passed without any new locally transmitted cases of Zika.  On August 19, CDC also issued guidance for a 1.5-square-mile section of South Miami Beach identified to have mosquito-borne spread of Zika; on September 17, this section was expanded to a 4.5-square-mile area that included areas of North Miami Beach.  On August 1, 2016, CDC issued guidance for people living in or traveling to a 1-square-mile area of the Wynwood neighborhood in Miami, FL, identified by the Florida Department of Health as having mosquito-borne spread of Zika.  For questions on mosquito control in Florida  Florida health officials can answer specific questions on Florida’s mosquito control program. Aerial treatment of areas with products that rapidly reduce the populations of mosquitoes can help to limit the number of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus. Repeated aerial applications of insecticide has reduced mosquito populations as a part of an integrated mosquito management program.

Credit: Rhona Wise Getty Images Advertisement  Local transmission of the Zika virus in Florida may have occurred as early as June 15 of last year and likely infected people who lived not only in Miami-Dade County, but in two nearby counties, U.S. health officials said on Monday.  The warning means that some men who donated semen to sperm banks in the area may not have been aware that they were at risk of infection, and may have donated sperm infected with the Zika virus, officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration told reporters in a telephone briefing.  The information is concerning because Zika has been shown to cause birth defects in women who become infected while pregnant. Previously, the CDC had warned of the risk of Zika in Miami-Dade County, beginning on July 29.  But the new warning dials that risk back to June 15, and adds in both Broward and Palm Beach Counties, home to the major tourist destinations of Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach.  Zika's arrival in Florida last summer followed the rapid spread of the mosquito-borne virus through Latin America and the Caribbean.  The World Health Organization last year declared Zika a global health emergency because of its link in Brazil with thousands cases of the birth defect microcephaly, which is marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains that can result in severe developmental problems.  U.S. officials said because of frequent travel between the three Florida counties, some women may have been infected and not been aware of it, either through contracting the infection directly from a mosquito bite while visiting Miami-Dade or through sex with an infected partner who had.  And because Zika has been shown to last up to three months in semen, it may mean some men living in the affected counties may have donated sperm without reporting they were at risk.  CDC Zika expert Dr. Denise Jamieson said the risk applies "particularly (to) women who became pregnant or are planning to become pregnant through the use of donor semen." She urged these women to "consult their healthcare provider to discuss the donation source and whether Zika virus testing is indicated."  The new warning came to light through investigations of several cases of Zika reported by the Florida Health Department late last year that suggested residents of Palm Beach or Broward counties may have become infected while traveling back and forth from Miami-Dade. According to the CDC, a total of 215 people are believed to have contracted Zika in Florida last year through the bite of a local mosquito. But since only one in five people infected with Zika become ill, experts believe the actual number was higher.  Officials said they weren't aware of any women who contracted Zika from infected semen donated to one of the 12 sperm banks in the three-county area. There is no approved test for Zika in sperm.  Jamieson said the CDC does not have any new evidence of local Zika transmission, but said it may occur again in the coming year, adding that the CDC was "on the lookout for additional cases of Zika."  A recent CDC study estimates that Zika infections cause a twenty-fold spike in the risk of certain birth defects, including microcephaly.

CBS News        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Florida is now Zika-free, U.S. health officials reported Friday. One area in south Miami Beach had remained an active zone for local transmission of the virus, which can cause severe birth defects in babies born to women who are infected while pregnant. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that there have been no new cases of local Zika transmission in South Miami Beach for more than 45 days, so that neighborhood is no longer considered an active zone. “Florida’s rapid response and comprehensive mosquito control program has allowed them to interrupt Zika transmission, but we must stay vigilant and also take what we have learned and be prepared for next season,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a news release. And he added a caveat. “Pregnant women who live or have been to this area should continue to be evaluated for Zika exposure during their prenatal visits to prevent the devastating effects Zika can cause in their infants,” Frieden said.     12  Photos   Portraits of Zika babies  After documenting the Zika crisis for a year, Associated Press photographer Felipe Dana gave his subjects the gift of family portraits   Florida is the only state to have confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika infection . But Texas officials, who recently reported a suspected case of local infection , said Friday that they have identified four more cases of suspected locally transmitted Zika virus in Cameron County, near the border with Mexico. The additional cases involve patients who live close to the first suspected case. Though the investigation is ongoing, the infections were likely acquired in that immediate area last month, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). None of the cases involve pregnant women , officials said. “The combination of mosquito control and colder weather has decreased mosquito activity in Cameron County and greatly decreased the probability of more widespread mosquito transmission of Zika right now,” Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner, said in a news release. “However, winters are mild in southern Texas, and mosquito populations can rebound even during short periods of warmer weather. Whenever you see mosquito activity, protect yourself and your family from bites.” Texas officials offered these Zika-protection tips: use EPA-approved insect repellent ; use air conditioning or window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of homes; wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts that cover exposed skin; remove standing water in and around homes that can become mosquito-breeding grounds. As of Dec. 8, an estimated 185 of more than 4,575 reported cases of Zika infection in the United States were spread locally by mosquitoes, according to the CDC. Most of the infections reported in the United States occurred in areas of Latin America and the Caribbean, where Zika cases have been at epidemic proportions. The virus is typically spread through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, although it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. Most adults who are infected with Zika experience mild symptoms. But, the babies of women who are infected while pregnant can experience devastating birth defects, the most common of which is microcephaly, where the brain is underdeveloped and the head is abnormally small.   © 2016 HealthDay.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the best way to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses is by preventing mosquito bites. The CDC encourages the use of protective clothing and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents, which are evaluated for effectiveness. The CDC recommends the following: Wear long sleeves, long pants and socks to cover skin, when possible. Use Insect Repellent: Always follow the product label instructions. Reapply insect repellent as directed. Do not spray insect repellent on the skin under clothing. Apply insect repellent to bare skin and clothing. For those using sunscreen, apply sunscreen before applying insect repellent. According to the CDC, insect repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and IR3535 are effective, for adults, when used as directed. For Babies and Children: Always follow instructions when applying insect repellent to children. Do not use insect repellent on babies younger than 2 months old. Do not apply insect repellent onto a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin. Adults: Spray insect repellent onto your hands and then apply to a child’s face. Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para-menthane-diol (PMD) on children under 3 years old. Dress your child in clothing that covers arms and legs. Cover crib, stroller, and baby carrier with mosquito netting. For the latest information, check the CDC website: www.cdc.gov .      Did you find this answer helpful?

Offers Guidelines for Delaying Pregnancy After Zika Exposure   By SABRINA TAVERNISE MARCH 25, 2016     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo        Priscila Cintron Rosa, 33, attended a talk in February at a hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico, about the dangers of Zika virus for pregnant women. The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She added, “We’ve become more concerned” about the period around the time of conception. “For people who either have the Zika disease or who travel to an area with active Zika transmission, we are now recommending they wait a period of time before trying to get pregnant.”     Zika Virus Rumors and Theories That You Should Doubt  Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.             For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

That's just one way health officials are battling back Zika-carrying mosquitoes in the area.  Joe Raedle/Getty Images     As expected, the Zika outbreak in Florida is growing — though how fast is still difficult to say.  State and federal health officials  say mosquitoes are spreading Zika in two neighborhoods of Miami, including Miami Beach. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told pregnant women Friday not to go into these neighborhoods — and to consider postponing travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County.  Just 37 people have been reported to have  caught the virus in these neighborhoods so far.  But many scientists are concerned that the outbreak in Florida may be larger and more widespread than the number of cases suggests.  "Zika is one of those diseases that is always like an iceberg — you just see the tip," says Alessandro Vespignani , a computer scientist at Northeastern University in Boston, who has been tasked with modeling the spread of the virus.  Most people who get Zika don't even know they have it, Vespignani explains. About 4 in 5 people don't have any symptoms, he says. And those who do get sick often have only mild symptoms that could be confused with the flu. So only about 5 percent of cases get detected, Vespignani has found .     To get better estimates of the number of silent infections in Miami and beyond, Vespignani and his colleagues built computer models that estimate how the virus is likely to spread.  "We estimate there will be 395 infected people by Sept. 15 [in Florida]," says Ira Longini , a biostatistician at the University of Florida, who collaborates with Vespignani.  About 80 of those people will show symptoms, Longini estimates. And about eight pregnant women are likely to get infected during their first trimester — which would put their fetuses at risk for microcephaly.  The number of Zika cases in Florida will very likely continue to rise until October or November, when cooler weather stops the mosquitoes, Longini says, though a number of variables could speed the spread before that.  " For example, on Monday the University of Florida opens its first day of classes," he says. "Tens of thousands of students will be coming from the Miami area, as well as from all over Latin America. So we could see a burst of cases by mid-September here in Gainesville."  Because of these uncertainties, many doctors around the country are recommending that their pregnant patients — and those trying to get pregnant — not travel to southern Florida.  And Florida isn't the only place in the continental U.S. at risk.  Longini has used the computer models to predict where Zika could show up next in the States. He says the big concern is Texas — which has roughly a 25 percent chance of having a small outbreak in the next month, according to the models.  "I would not be surprised if we see cases in Texas and Louisiana," Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told  ABC News Sunday, citing the flooding in Louisiana as something Zika watchers will be keeping an eye on.  "There's going to be a lot of problems getting rid of standing water [there]," Fauci says — puddles where Zika-carrying mosquitoes could breed and thrive.     zika  pregnant women  mathematical modeling  Miami  STD  Florida       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

In Brazil, cases are down by 95 percent from last year. Across the Caribbean, outbreaks have subsided. And in Florida, the virus seems to have gone into hiding. Health officials haven't investigated a new Zika case for more than 45 days in Miami-Dade County.      Shots - Health News  Miami's Zika Outbreak Began Months Before It Was First Detected        Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted the last travel warning for southern Florida. The agency is no longer recommending that pregnant women avoid the region.  "That's really exciting news," says Dr. Christine Curry , an OB-GYN at the University of Miami and Jackson Memorial Hospital. "Everybody has sort of exhaled."  But the threat to pregnant women, whether residents or travelers,  isn't over — not in the least — Curry says, neither in Florida nor abroad.  So what should pregnant women and their families, or women who are trying to get pregnant, do? Let's start with Florida. Then we'll swing back to the international question at the end.  Living or traveling in South Florida  "We can't go back to the days before Zika, where you just walked around without thinking about bug spray or the clothes you're wearing," Curry says. "People still need to practice good mosquito-bite prevention when they're living in South Florida or traveling there."         Goats and Soda  Is Zika Dangerous For Kids? It Probably Depends On The Age        The CDC outlines the precautions needed in Miami-Dade County and other areas of the U.S. where Zika has circulated, such as Brownsville, Texas.  These precautions are most important for pregnant women, those trying to get pregnant and their mates. For example:   Expectant couples should continue to use condoms "every time they have sex (including vaginal, anal, and oral sex)," the CDC writes, because the Zika virus can stay in the semen of an infected man for months.  Pregnant women should continue to get tested for Zika up to eight weeks after the travel ban has been lifted for a region — which would be until about August of 2017 for South Florida.   Such precautions are important, Curry says, for several reasons.  First, even when it looks like Zika has "disappeared," Curry says, it could still be circulating. About 80 percent people who are infected with the virus don't have any symptoms at all.      Shots - Health News  51 Babies Born With Zika-Related Birth Defects In The U.S. Last Year        And if the virus is merely lurking below detectable levels, Zika cases could start cropping up again  at any moment. Last summer, Zika likely circulated in Florida for months before it was detected by health officials, a recent study found .  So if you live in South Florida, or are headed there this summer, pack the DEET , cover clothes in permethrin and be on the lookout for skeeters.  Traveling overseas  Although Zika cases have dropped across the Caribbean and Latin America, the CDC's travel recommendations haven't changed. Pregnant women should not travel to places where Zika is circulating. If a spouse travels to one of these areas, the couple should use condoms for at least six months.  Couples trying to get pregnant should also not travel to these regions. If they must, the CDC recommends waiting at least six months before trying to conceive after a man returns from a country with Zika and waiting at least eight weeks after a woman returns.  Fetal medicine expert Dr. Neil Silverman worries that some doctors are forgetting to give their patients  these travel warnings.  "We've gotten calls at our practice from women who have traveled to areas where's there's clearly active transmission of Zika," says Silverman, an OB-GYN at the Center for Fetal Medicine in Los Angeles.  "Either their doctors have essentially decided the risk is over or the woman forgot to ask. Then they come back home and realize that there was a risk."  Even if a country has reported only a few cases — or hasn't had a case in months — Silverman says the recommendations are the same.  Take for instance, India, which reported its first official cases in May. There were only three cases recorded, across the entire country. But the virus has likely been circulating in India for decades, studies show. And pregnant women should avoid travel there, Silverman says.  " For the purpose of a traveler, there's not a huge distinction between whether a country has a large number of new cases occurring or whether there's sort of a background, long-standing risk," he says.  Places with this sort of background risk include large parts of Southeast Asia and Africa.  So if you're pregnant or "trying," check out the CDC's Zika map before booking a plane ticket, and avoid all the areas that are purple on the map.  "With everything else going on in the country and in the world, Zika has taken a little bit of a backseat in the news cycle," Silverman says. "But it's still a big concern."     zika  Caribbean  birth defects  Travel  Florida       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

By Alexandra Sifferlin  June 23, 2017        TIME Health  For more, visit TIME Health .   Last summer, public health experts were on high alert due to the rapid spread of the Zika virus , which has now been proven to cause birth defects and other health problems in infants. Today, experts know far more about the virus than they did at the start of the outbreak. Here’s what you need to know now about Zika.  Should pregnant women worry about Zika while traveling?  Short answer: yes. “Our general advice is that if you are pregnant, you should not go to places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing,” says Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “It’s all a matter of risk. Obviously, if you are staying in an air-conditioned hotel, your risk may be less. However, are you willing to take that risk? We know the consequences of infection of the fetus are huge and lifelong.”      Petersen recommends people check the CDC website for guidance on what locations have active Zika transmission. The CDC updates this list regularly, sometimes on a daily basis. If an area is no longer on the list, Petersen says it’s considered safe to travel. Currently, the CDC recommends that if a pregnant woman or her partner travel to an area with Zika, the couple should use condoms every time they have sex or avoid sex for the rest of the pregnancy, even if they do not have symptoms of Zika.

Women who are planning to get pregnant, and their partners, should also pay attention to where they are traveling. The first trimester, during which women may not know they are pregnant, appears to be the most risky time when it comes to Zika-related health complications for infants down the line.    The CDC recommends that women who travel to areas with Zika who want to get pregnant in the near future wait at least eight weeks after their last possible exposure to the virus before trying to conceive. For male partners, the CDC advises waiting six months after the last possible exposure before trying to conceive. Using condoms is also recommended for the waiting period.  What if I am invited to a destination wedding in a place with Zika? Should I not go?  It may be challenging to get a firm yes or no from your doctor about whether or not you should travel for a major event, though the recommendations are not to go to places with active Zika transmission if you’re pregnant or want to be soon. “My job is to give guidance; I never tell people what to do,” says Dr. Richard Beigi, the chief medical officer of the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “But I think the travel warnings are there for a reason, and nothing has changed from last year other than the fact that we have more information that has validated that Zika causes congenital health problems. The overall risk is the same.”      Deciding to travel despite the risk is ultimately a personal decision. “I ask my patients, ‘Do you really need to go?’ For some people, the answer to that is yes, and that’s fine, and I give them the best advice I can,” Beigi says.  Should I worry about traveling to places that have the types of mosquitoes that can spread Zika?  The CDC recently reported that the types of mosquito that carry Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , are appearing in more counties in the southern U.S. where they haven’t been before. But unless the mosquitoes are transmitting Zika, there’s a “very, very, very low risk,” Petersen says. “In all of the places where we have this kind of mosquito that can spread Zika virus, we also see the kinds of mosquitoes that can spread West Nile and other diseases,” says Petersen. “General mosquito precautions in the summer are important for everybody—not only pregnant women.”      How likely is it that I will get Zika?  Experts can’t give a definitive answer to a person’s chances of getting Zika if they travel to a place that has reported spread of the disease. But experts are getting closer to understanding the likelihood of adverse events should a pregnant woman get infected.  A recent study found that one in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. with a Zika infection had a baby with brain damage or other serious birth defects. The first trimester was the most critical time: 15% of women with confirmed Zika infection in the first trimester had babies with birth defects. Another study found similar numbers for women in U.S. territories, revealing that during their first trimester, nearly 1 in 12 had a baby or fetus with Zika-associated birth defects.      “Out of the data collected, it appears that 5-10% of the time a woman gets Zika during her pregnancy, there will be in impact,” says Beigi. “Most of the impact is a malfunction; some of it is miscarriage. Probably the absolute risk of you having a problem is not very big, but it’s not zero, and it’s hard to know.”  How bad will Zika get in the U.S. this summer?  It’s unclear how many cases of Zika will be expected in and outside the U.S. this summer, though experts say it could be lower than last year. “Based on historical evidence, we would expect that outbreaks this year throughout the Western Hemisphere are going to be less than they were the year before,” says Petersen. “It’s not going away, but since a lot of people have already been infected and are no longer susceptible to infection, it will lower the number of cases over time.”  So far in 2017, about 650 Americans have gotten Zika, though that it is considered an underestimate. Most people do not experience symptoms and will not know they have the virus.

Credit: Rhona Wise Getty Images Advertisement  Local transmission of the Zika virus in Florida may have occurred as early as June 15 of last year and likely infected people who lived not only in Miami-Dade County, but in two nearby counties, U.S. health officials said on Monday.  The warning means that some men who donated semen to sperm banks in the area may not have been aware that they were at risk of infection, and may have donated sperm infected with the Zika virus, officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration told reporters in a telephone briefing.  The information is concerning because Zika has been shown to cause birth defects in women who become infected while pregnant. Previously, the CDC had warned of the risk of Zika in Miami-Dade County, beginning on July 29.  But the new warning dials that risk back to June 15, and adds in both Broward and Palm Beach Counties, home to the major tourist destinations of Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach.  Zika's arrival in Florida last summer followed the rapid spread of the mosquito-borne virus through Latin America and the Caribbean.  The World Health Organization last year declared Zika a global health emergency because of its link in Brazil with thousands cases of the birth defect microcephaly, which is marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains that can result in severe developmental problems.  U.S. officials said because of frequent travel between the three Florida counties, some women may have been infected and not been aware of it, either through contracting the infection directly from a mosquito bite while visiting Miami-Dade or through sex with an infected partner who had.  And because Zika has been shown to last up to three months in semen, it may mean some men living in the affected counties may have donated sperm without reporting they were at risk.  CDC Zika expert Dr. Denise Jamieson said the risk applies "particularly (to) women who became pregnant or are planning to become pregnant through the use of donor semen." She urged these women to "consult their healthcare provider to discuss the donation source and whether Zika virus testing is indicated."  The new warning came to light through investigations of several cases of Zika reported by the Florida Health Department late last year that suggested residents of Palm Beach or Broward counties may have become infected while traveling back and forth from Miami-Dade. According to the CDC, a total of 215 people are believed to have contracted Zika in Florida last year through the bite of a local mosquito. But since only one in five people infected with Zika become ill, experts believe the actual number was higher.  Officials said they weren't aware of any women who contracted Zika from infected semen donated to one of the 12 sperm banks in the three-county area. There is no approved test for Zika in sperm.  Jamieson said the CDC does not have any new evidence of local Zika transmission, but said it may occur again in the coming year, adding that the CDC was "on the lookout for additional cases of Zika."  A recent CDC study estimates that Zika infections cause a twenty-fold spike in the risk of certain birth defects, including microcephaly.

Why? A sudden surge in Brazilian babies born with microcephaly – a birth defect caused by the Zika infection during pregnancy – sparked massive concern and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a public health emergency. The disease is also linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis.  But there’s an added twist that makes this situation even more complex: Brazil, the country at the center of the current Zika crisis, is slated to host nearly 500,000 visitors this summer. Media attention on the problem has exploded, and experts are even debating whether visitors and athletes should make the trip.  At Casino.org, we’re very familiar with odds – so we decided to calculate the likelihood of the average person contracting Zika this summer in Rio. How does the risk of Zika compare with the risk of other illnesses and accidents? What percentage of the U.S. population currently has the disease? And what are the real odds of catching Zika in Rio this summer? Is the Zika/Rio debate truly a global health crisis – or a case of media hype? Read on to get the full story.    What Do You Have a Greater Chance of Dying From?  So you’ve booked your flight to Rio, and planned your accommodations. What’s the likelihood that you’ll make it back home without catching Zika? Pretty decent: 99.999996 percent.   Another way to gain perspective is to compare your 0.000004 percent chance of contracting Zika in Rio this summer with the odds of dying from various other conditions. Only one person has died in the continental U.S. from Zika as of July 11. You are more than twice as likely to die from legal execution, 73 times more likely to die from choking on food, and over 2,212 times more likely to die in an automobile crash than to even contract Zika in Rio.     How Many Times More Likely Is ...  Should you head to Brazil this summer, you can rest easy when it comes to worrying about Zika: You only have a 1 in 250,000 chance of contracting the virus. By our reckoning, you have a lot more to worry about before you stress about that.   You're thousands of times more likely to die from an auto accident than you are likely to contract Zika in Rio. You’re also hundreds of times more likely to die from a shooting or drowning. Even the most random fatal accidents are more probable: Falling, air accidents, and even lightning strikes should worry you more than contracting Zika.     Zika Infections Across the Country  Zika is making headlines across the United States and around the globe – so we took a look at actual known cases of the virus among people within the United States . First of all, every known case of Zika in the U.S. is associated with travel to an outbreak area or sex with an infected person – there are no known cases of Zika caused by a mosquito bite on American soil as of July 11.  Washington, D.C., tops the list for highest percentage of Zika cases: 0.000893 percent of the population has contracted the disease. New York, Hawaii, and Florida have the next highest rates. In five states – Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, and Alaska – there are no known cases of Zika at all.     Comparing Zika With Ebola, Malaria, and Other Diseases  Zika is constantly being discussed in the media, but how does it compare to other buzzed-about diseases? In the past decade, Ebola, malaria, and the West Nile virus have had just as much media coverage. In 2014, the United States was in an Ebola panic , and many were afraid they would contract Ebola.   While it’s 53 times more likely a resident of the United States will contract Zika over Ebola, those odds were during Ebola’s peak in 2014 and the Zika odds require a trip to Rio this summer. Here in the U.S., your odds of contracting Ebola and Zika are slim, and you are much more likely of contracting a severe form of West Nile disease or even malaria. Your best bet? Wear bug spray and see a doctor if you display any symptoms.    Contracting Zika or Dengue Fever in Rio  As we’ve discovered, the likelihood of contracting Zika this summer isn’t particularly high. It’s much more likely you’d catch a cold or some other common illness from someone beside you in the stands. But what about another mosquito-borne disease?  Dengue fever is a major risk for people who reside in the tropics and subtropics. It is a leading cause of illness and even death in those regions. No vaccine exists, so the best protection is to simply avoid mosquito bites.   Of the nearly half a million projected visitors to Rio this summer, odds are that only two may contract Zika. On the other hand, chances are that about 279 Rio visitors could contract dengue fever.     What Else Is More Likely?  Asteroids. UFOs. Four-leaf clovers. They’re the stuff of dreams – or in some cases, nightmares. But, amazingly, you’re likelier to encounter one of these than you are to become a victim of Zika. For instance, a person is 25 times likelier to find a four-leaf clover on their first try than to contract Zika in Rio this summer.   In addition, a woman in the United States is 8 times more likely to spot a UFO than to give birth to a baby with microcephaly as a result of Zika contracted in Rio.    Calculating the Odds  As you can see, the odds of contracting Zika in Rio this summer are astronomically slim. However, the debate rages on .   Zika is a serious disease, and even one case is a case too many. However, of those who become infected, 8 in 10 don’t even display symptoms, and the remaining 2 in 10 usually aren’t ill enough to require medical treatment. Zika’s greatest danger, by far, is to pregnant women.  It’s always important to do the research, weigh the risks, and calculate the odds.

Here are 9 facts to calm you down.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email             With Zika moving through nearly every country in the Western Hemisphere over the past year and a half, it was only a matter of time before the virus made its way to the continental US.  At the end of July, health officials announced that a handful of Zika infections had originated from mosquitoes in Miami, Florida. As of August 22 , there were 37 locally-acquired cases in Florida, mostly concentrated in a one square mile area  of Miami's Wynwood neighborhood.  Zika was discovered in the 1940s, but most people had never heard of it until last year. That's because for decades, Zika outbreaks were sporadic and tiny, and the disease seemed to do little harm.   Related   Zika in Florida, explained in 600 words     That changed in 2015. A massive outbreak in Brazil altered the scientific community's view of the mosquito-borne virus. Scientists learned that Zika can actually be a lot more dangerous than anyone thought, causing devastating birth defects in fetuses and even miscarriages. In light of that, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency on February 1 this year.  Meanwhile, the virus has been on the move. To date, more than 60 countries and territories have reported mosquito transmission of the virus, and 11 countries have seen sexual transmission of Zika. The US is only the latest country to grapple with a Zika virus outbreak.  1) Zika is spreading locally in Florida — but don't expect it to go very far  Here's a quick recap of what's going on in Florida, the only state so far with native Zika transmission: On July 19 , health officials announced that a woman living in Miami-Dade County, Florida, had tested positive for the mosquito-borne and sexually transmitted virus. But unlike all of the other Zika cases reported in the US at the time, she had no travel history to a country with Zika.  Since then, a small number of people in the area seem to have been similarly infected by local mosquitoes. The 37 cases are mostly concentrated in a  one square mile area of Miami's Wynwood neighborhood .           Florida Department of Health     But the virus is spreading. On August 19, health officials confirmed  that five new cases had sprung up in the Miami Beach area — outside the  one square mile in Wynwood. Another case has since popped up near Tampa , on the other side of Florida.  In response, the CDC expanded their travel advisory , warning pregnant women to avoid the part of Miami Beach where Zika is spreading, as well as the Wynwood area. They've also advised pregnant women and their partners to consider avoiding nonessential travel to Miami-Dade. According to the  New York Times , this is likely to "threaten tourism in South Florida and deepen fears among pregnant women living in the area."  A small Zika outbreak in Florida wouldn't exactly be surprising. Zika has been identified in mosquitoes in more than 60 countries and territories over the past year, and the CDC has warned that the southeastern part of the US — particularly Florida and Texas — was at risk of outbreaks during mosquito season this year. It’s the region where the Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes thrive in the greatest concentrations.  There have already been more than 2,200 travel-related Zika cases in the US, while some 8,000 people in US territories (mainly Puerto Rico) have acquired the virus locally.          Where Zika is likely to spread.  PLoS Currents    But don't panic. Officials expect that Zika will likely follow the same pattern in the continental US as dengue fever, leading to small outbreaks in the southeastern US.  "Better housing construction, regular use of air conditioning, use of window screens and door screens and state and local mosquito control efforts helped to eliminate [mosquito-borne infections like malaria] from the mainland," said Lyle Petersen, director of the CDC's division of vector-borne diseases, in a statement this year. All these factors are expected to prevent widespread transmission here.  2) About 80 percent of people don't experience any symptoms with Zika  The vast majority of people who get Zika won’t even know they have it. A minority — roughly 20 percent — show relatively minor symptoms: a low-grade fever, sore body, and headache, as well as red eyes and a body rash. More rarely, this might include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. These symptoms usually appear two to 12 days after a bite and go away within a week, and with the same type of care as the flu — bed rest, fluids, etc.          A rash caused by Zika virus.  (Emerging Infectious Diseases)    There’s no vaccine or cure for the virus. But severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon, as is death from the virus. Once a person has been infected with Zika, they are thought to develop lifelong immunity.  But that's not the whole story. In rare occasions, Zika causes really serious health complications.  In both the Brazil and French Polynesia outbreaks , researchers noted that some people infected with the virus were later diagnosed with Guillain-Barré, a rare and sometimes deadly neurological condition in which people's immune systems damage their nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis. The symptoms can last weeks, months, or even years.  Again, though, this is rare: about one in 4,000 Zika cases, according to the WHO . And it’s not unique to Zika. Other viral diseases — like dengue and chikungunya — also cause Guillain-Barré.  More worryingly, Zika seems to have a particular appetite for the neurological cells of fetuses. When a pregnant woman catches the virus, her fetus faces a risk of severe birth defects, including microcephaly, which is characterized by a shrunken head and incomplete brain development.  The association between microcephaly and Zika has been seen in this outbreak in Brazil, as well as in reanalyses of the data from previous outbreaks, such as one in the French Polynesian islands in 2013 to 2014 .  In addition, researchers have found that the virus seems to kill off the tissue in entire regions of the fetus’s brain, damage babies' eyes and ears,  and heighten the risk of miscarriage.  3) One percent of pregnant women who get Zika will have birth complications  The risk of birth complications is low. The WHO estimates that the fetuses of one in 100 women with Zika will go on to develop microcephaly or other abnormalities. And researchers believe the risks of Zika-related birth defects are greatest if a woman is infected in the first trimester of her pregnancy.          Countries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection as of July 14, 2016.  PAHO    Zika isn’t the first virus to cause microcephaly. Rubella famously caused an epidemic of birth defects before the advent of the vaccine, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) can damage fetuses too.  But Zika is the first mosquito-borne virus to threaten fetuses. And even if these birth defects turn out to be a very rare complication of Zika, the risk to fetuses was enough to prompt the WHO to declare a rare global public health emergency earlier this year.  4) We don't fully understand all the ways Zika spreads  Zika is mainly carried by a specific type of mosquito called Aedes aegypti , which spreads the disease through bites.  What makes the Aedes aegypti a unique threat is that it is remarkably effective at carrying viruses — it's also the primary vector of the yellow fever, dengue, and chikungunya viruses.  Aedes mosquitoes are incredibly well-adapted to thrive alongside humans. They can breed and rest in small pools of water and moist environments around people's homes. (You can see examples of the mosquito's main aquatic habitats here , ranging from rain-filled cavities in trees to outdoor pots and animal drinking pans.) This is different from other types of mosquitoes, which prefer larger bodies of water.  Mosquito transmission, while thought to be the primary method, is not the only way to spread the virus.  As we’ve discussed already, Zika can also be passed from mother to child.  And it can be spread through sex. There have been more than 20 cases of Zika sexual transmission in 10 countries , involving oral, anal, and vaginal sex, and the virus has been shown to spread from women to men , men to men , and men to woman.  People can contract Zika through blood transfusions. In Brazil, there have been multiple reports of Zika spreading through blood transfusions, according to the CDC .  Finally, it's possible Zika can spread through saliva or urine , since live virus has been isolated from these bodily fluids, but there’s not a lot of clarity yet about this mode of transmission.  Researchers are also exploring other potential routes Zika spreads. In a mysterious recent case in Utah , a man who died from Zika passed it on to his caregiver, though the two didn’t engage in sex (the caregiver was reportedly the man’s son ) and officials don't believe Aedes mosquitoes, which carry the virus, were involved, since they aren’t established in Utah.  5) Zika can be sexually transmitted — but simple precautions can reduce the risk  The virus stays in the blood for 11 days on average, and potentially much longer in other bodily fluids.  In men, the virus can persist in semen for more than 180 days (though it's unclear for how long it remains infectious). In women, researchers have found Zika in vaginal fluid 11 days after a woman showed symptoms of infection.  According to Margaret Honein, the CDC’s co-lead of the ‎Pregnancy and Birth Defects Task Force for the Zika response, the latest reported time that a man was able to spread the virus through sex after a Zika illness was between 32 and 41 days.  6) Women exposed to Zika should wait at least eight weeks before becoming pregnant  First things first: If you’re pregnant, avoid mosquito bites, practice safe sex with your partner, and stay out of areas where the virus is spreading.  Researchers believe pregnant women are at the greatest risk of having babies with birth defects if they are infected in the first trimester. (More from the CDC here.)  For couples who are thinking of becoming pregnant soon, the CDC’s recommendations for waiting to conceive vary depending on your likelihood of infection:          CDC    7) Men should avoid infecting a partner who may become pregnant  Again, the most important risk is really to pregnant women and their babies. So for men, the key concern is infecting a partner with Zika who may become pregnant. Either abstain from sex or use condoms for at least a period of eight weeks if you were in a place with Zika but showed no signs of infection, and up to six months if you had symptoms or were diagnosed with the virus (see the above chart for details).  8) If you're at risk of Zika, clean up your house, wear mosquito repellent, and practice safe sex  Since Zika is carried by mosquitoes and there's no vaccine, the best way to prevent outbreaks is to prevent mosquitoes that carry the virus from biting people.  The Aedes mosquitoes that carry Zika prefer small bodies of water around people's homes, so there are measures you can take to really limit mosquitoes' habitats, says Janet McAllister, a researcher in the division of vector-borne diseases at the CDC.  McAllister recommends "just generally keeping your yard clean and in shape, getting rid of debris or things stored outside that can hold water, or adjusting them so that they no longer hold water." She adds, "It's also important to maintain the vegetation in your yard — to keep the grass mowed and bushes trimmed, with good air flow."  Inside the home , the CDC recommends making sure you have screens on windows and doors that aren't punctured in any way. Wearing protective clothing, using insect repellents, and keeping your house cool with air conditioning also helps.  Since Zika can be spread through sexual contact, practicing safe sex (using condoms) with partners that may have come into contact with the virus is recommended, too. (See points 6 and 7.)  9) Before 2007, there were only 14 documented Zika cases  Zika is actually an old virus that only recently began to worry health experts. It was discovered in 1947 when it was isolated from monkeys in the Zika forest in Uganda. And for decades thereafter, it seemed to be barely bother humans.  Prior to 2007, there were only 14 documented Zika cases . But then the first big outbreak erupted on Yap island in Micronesia , with 49 confirmed cases. And from there, the virus was on the move.  Soon cases popped up in other Pacific islands, including a large outbreak in 2013-'14 in French Polynesia (388 cases). By May 2015, health officials had detected the virus in Brazil.  Zika has since spread to more than 60 countries and territories — mostly concentrated in Central and South America and the Caribbean. All this means that we're in the throes of the biggest Zika outbreaks in history, and there's still a lot we have to learn about the virus.

CBS News        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Florida is now Zika-free, U.S. health officials reported Friday. One area in south Miami Beach had remained an active zone for local transmission of the virus, which can cause severe birth defects in babies born to women who are infected while pregnant. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that there have been no new cases of local Zika transmission in South Miami Beach for more than 45 days, so that neighborhood is no longer considered an active zone. “Florida’s rapid response and comprehensive mosquito control program has allowed them to interrupt Zika transmission, but we must stay vigilant and also take what we have learned and be prepared for next season,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a news release. And he added a caveat. “Pregnant women who live or have been to this area should continue to be evaluated for Zika exposure during their prenatal visits to prevent the devastating effects Zika can cause in their infants,” Frieden said.     12  Photos   Portraits of Zika babies  After documenting the Zika crisis for a year, Associated Press photographer Felipe Dana gave his subjects the gift of family portraits   Florida is the only state to have confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika infection . But Texas officials, who recently reported a suspected case of local infection , said Friday that they have identified four more cases of suspected locally transmitted Zika virus in Cameron County, near the border with Mexico. The additional cases involve patients who live close to the first suspected case. Though the investigation is ongoing, the infections were likely acquired in that immediate area last month, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). None of the cases involve pregnant women , officials said. “The combination of mosquito control and colder weather has decreased mosquito activity in Cameron County and greatly decreased the probability of more widespread mosquito transmission of Zika right now,” Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner, said in a news release. “However, winters are mild in southern Texas, and mosquito populations can rebound even during short periods of warmer weather. Whenever you see mosquito activity, protect yourself and your family from bites.” Texas officials offered these Zika-protection tips: use EPA-approved insect repellent ; use air conditioning or window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of homes; wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts that cover exposed skin; remove standing water in and around homes that can become mosquito-breeding grounds. As of Dec. 8, an estimated 185 of more than 4,575 reported cases of Zika infection in the United States were spread locally by mosquitoes, according to the CDC. Most of the infections reported in the United States occurred in areas of Latin America and the Caribbean, where Zika cases have been at epidemic proportions. The virus is typically spread through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, although it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. Most adults who are infected with Zika experience mild symptoms. But, the babies of women who are infected while pregnant can experience devastating birth defects, the most common of which is microcephaly, where the brain is underdeveloped and the head is abnormally small.   © 2016 HealthDay.

The Florida Department of Health confirmed the two local cases July 29, 2016. Florida’s first CDC-confirmed travel-related cases were in Miami-Dade and Hillsborough counties six months earlier.  The map below shows when the Florida Department of Health reported cases in each county. In late 2016, the department began including pregnant women and non-residents who were diagnosed in Florida in the state’s county and type-of-transmission totals.

In February 2016, the CDC began to issue weekly counts of cases reported by states and territories of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases. In February 2017, the CDC began issuing weekly counts of blood donors whose blood tested positive for the Zika virus regardless of being symptomatic.

The Zika virus causes a serious birth defect called microcephaly — an underdeveloped brain and small head — and is linked to other neurological disorders in adults. Roughly 4 in 5 infected people are asymptomatic, but the disease’s most common symptoms are mild and include fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes.  The virus is primarily spread through mosquito bites and can also be transmitted through sex and blood transfusions.  A public health emergency of international concern was declared by the World Health Organization on Feb. 1, 2016, as the virus spread through Latin America and the Caribbean. WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan declared the end of the emergency on November 18, 2016, and on February 1 she stated : “WHO and affected countries need to manage Zika not on an emergency footing, but in the same sustained way we respond to other established epidemic-prone pathogens.”    Severe birth defects  The CDC has confirmed the Zika virus causes microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. It can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus during pregnancy. The agency advises women who are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant not to travel to Zika-affected areas.  If a pregnant woman’s partner has been to such an area, the couple should abstain from sex or use condoms during the pregnancy. Currently, the CDC does not believe there is risk for the future pregnancies of a woman who has Zika once the virus clears from her blood.    Mosquito control is key  Zika is primarily spread to people through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito — the same kind that causes dengue and chikungunya viruses.  To keep mosquitoes from multiplying, the Florida Department of Health recommends draining standing water once or twice a week. Garbage cans, bird baths and pool covers are all prime breeding grounds. Miami-Dade County residents can request a mosquito inspection or report a mosquito nuisance by calling 3-1-1 .  The department also recommends using screens to cover doors and windows. To avoid bites while outside, cover skin with clothing and use mosquito repellent. Those with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and IR3535 are effective. Florida has a Zika Virus Information Hotline managed by the Department of Health that can be reached at 1-855-622-6735 .

Influenza can cause mild to severe illness. 
                    Serious outcomes of flu infection are hospitalization or death.  Florida is currently experiencing a moderately severe influenza season. The best way to protect yourself from flu is to get vaccinated, practice good hand washing hygiene, and stay home/keep children home when sick.

There are no new travel-related cases to report today. Please visit our website to see the full list of travel-related cases by county and year. The department updates the travel-related case chart online each weekday.  There are three locally acquired cases being reported today. Two are cases that had samples collected in October as part of our ongoing investigation and the department just received confirmatory testing back from CDC. These two cases have been added to the 2016 chart.  The third case reported no symptoms, but screening conducted after blood donation in January showed evidence of a past infection. The department concluded our investigation of this case yesterday. This individual had multiple exposures in Miami-Dade County and likely contracted Zika in 2016. Because the individual was asymptomatic, it is difficult to determine when infection occurred. Since the first positive sample was collected in January, this is considered our first locally reported case of Zika in 2017. Florida still does not have any identified areas with ongoing, active Zika transmission.    The total number of Zika cases reported in Florida for 2016 is 1,384. The total number of Zika cases reported in Florida for 2017 is 18.    2016       Infection Type    Infection Count      Travel-Related Infections Of Zika    1076      Locally Acquired Infections Of Zika    276      Undetermined    32      .

Pregnant Women With Lab-Evidence Of Zika    4      Florida no longer has any identified areas with active Zika transmission, but we will continue to see isolated cases of local transmission so it is important for residents and visitors in Miami-Dade County to remain vigilant about mosquito bite protection.  It is important for people to remember to take proper precautions to prevent mosquito bites while traveling to areas with widespread Zika transmission. The CDC list of these locations is available here .  One case does not mean ongoing active transmission is taking place. DOH conducts a thorough investigation by sampling close contacts and community members around each case to determine if additional people are infected. If DOH finds evidence that active transmission is occurring in an area, the media and the public will be notified.  The department has conducted Zika virus testing for more than 12,700 people statewide. Florida currently has the capacity to test 4,653 people for active Zika virus and 5,152 for Zika antibodies. At Governor Scott’s direction, all county health departments now offer free Zika risk assessment and testing to pregnant women.  The CDC advises pregnant women should consider postponing travel to Miami-Dade County. If you are pregnant and must travel or if you live or work in Miami-Dade County, protect yourself from mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, long clothing and limiting your time outdoors.  According to CDC guidance, providers should test all pregnant women who lived in, traveled to or whose partner traveled to Miami-Dade County after Aug. 1, 2016. Pregnant women in Miami-Dade County can contact their medical provider or their local county health department to be tested and receive a Zika prevention kit. Additionally, the department is working closely with the Healthy Start Coalition of Miami-Dade County to identify pregnant women in Miami-Dade County to ensure they have access to resources and information to protect themselves. CDC recommends that a pregnant woman with a history of Zika virus and her provider should consider additional ultrasounds.  Pregnant women can contact their local county health department for Zika risk assessment and testing hours and information. A Zika risk assessment will be conducted by county health department staff and blood and/or urine samples may be collected and sent to labs for testing. It may take one to two weeks to receive results.  Florida has been monitoring pregnant women with evidence of Zika regardless of symptoms. The total number of pregnant women who have been or are being monitored is 264.  On Feb. 12, Governor Scott directed the State Surgeon General to activate a Zika Virus Information Hotline for current Florida residents and visitors, as well as anyone planning on traveling to Florida in the near future. The number for the Zika Virus Information Hotline is 1-855-622-6735 .  The department urges Floridians to drain standing water weekly, no matter how seemingly small. A couple drops of water in a bottle cap can be a breeding location for mosquitoes. Residents and visitors also need to use repellents when enjoying the Florida outdoors.

Red outline shows previously designated Zika active transmission (red) areas. Yellow outline shows previously designated Zika cautionary (yellow) areas.       Miami-Dade County, FL. Red outline shows previously designated Zika active transmission (red) areas. Yellow outline shows previously designated Zika cautionary (yellow) areas.    CDC previously issued guidance related to Zika for people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County, Florida, which advised that pregnant women not travel to this area due to local transmission of Zika virus. CDC designates areas for Zika virus transmission prevention in the continental United States and Hawaii as red or yellow . Miami-Dade County was previously designated as a Zika cautionary (yellow) area, but that designation was removed on June 2, 2017. This means that there are no longer any travel recommendations related to Zika virus for Miami-Dade County, Florida. Although the level of risk of Zika virus transmission after a yellow area is removed is not known, it is likely to be low. However, sporadic cases may still occur. For this reason, CDC recommends that people living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County continue to protect themselves from mosquito-borne illnesses, including Zika virus, by following the guidance below. See CDC’s travel, testing, and pregnancy planning guidance for areas with reported mosquito-borne spread of Zika virus.  Hurricanes and mosquitoes   Learn more about mosquitoes and hurricanes .   Travel   Because Miami-Dade County is no longer a yellow area, there are no recommendations to avoid travel to this area.   Prevention   Women and men who live in or travel to Miami-Dade County should remain aware of any new reports of Zika virus transmission in their area and should follow steps to prevent mosquito bites to reduce their risk for illnesses spread by mosquitoes, including Zika virus.  Because Zika virus can persist for months in semen, there may still be a continuing risk for sexual transmission, whether or not the partner had symptoms of Zika. Pregnant women and their partners who live in or travel to Miami-Dade County who want to reduce their risk of Zika virus infection should use condoms every time they have sex (including vaginal, anal, and oral sex), or they should not have sex during the pregnancy.  Women who are not pregnant and men who live in or travel to these areas who want to reduce their risk of Zika virus infection should consider using condoms every time they have sex, or not having sex.  Men should consider condom use for at least 6 months, and women should consider having sex with a condom for at least 8 weeks from June 2, 2017.   Testing and Diagnosis   Anyone who lived in, traveled to, or had sex without a condom with someone who lived in or traveled to Miami-Dade County between August 1, 2016, and June 2, 2017, who has signs and symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease should be tested.  CDC recommendations for pregnant women can be found in the updated MMWR report .  The state of Florida may take into account the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission and other epidemiologic considerations (e.g., seasonality and mosquito surveillance and control factors) and, therefore, might include a routine recommendation to test asymptomatic pregnant women either for clinical care or as part of Zika virus infection surveillance. Healthcare providers should contact their state health department for state specific guidance .   Pregnancy Planning   People living in Miami-Dade County should talk to their healthcare provider about pregnancy plans. Although the level of Zika virus transmission is likely to be low, sporadic cases may still occur. In addition, couples should consider the possible resurgence of active transmission of Zika virus during the next mosquito season in their pregnancy planning.  Men who traveled to Miami-Dade County between August 1, 2016, and June 2, 2017 should consider waiting at least 6 months after their last possible exposure to this area before attempting to conceive with their partner.  Women who traveled to Miami-Dade County between August 1, 2016, and June 2, 2017 should consider waiting at least 8 weeks after their last possible exposure to this area before attempting to conceive with their partner.  If both male and female partners of a couple traveled together to Miami-Dade County between August 1, 2016, and June 2, 2017, they should consider waiting at least 6 months after their last possible exposure to this area before attempting to conceive.  Limited data are available about the persistence of Zika in body fluids and the chances of harm to a pregnancy when the woman is infected with Zika around the time of conception. Some couples with a partner with possible Zika virus exposure may choose to wait longer or shorter than the recommended period to try to get pregnant. For more information, see CDC’s travel, testing, and pregnancy planning guidance for areas with reported mosquito-borne spread of Zika virus.   Previous Zika active transmission areas (Red areas) and Zika cautionary areas (Yellow areas)  Because the yellow area designation was removed on June 2, 2017, the guidance shown above now applies to all of Miami-Dade County that had previously been designated as red or yellow areas. Women and men living in or who traveled to these areas should be aware that these locations were considered to have Zika virus spread previously. Although the level of risk of Zika virus transmission after a yellow area designation is removed is unknown, it is likely to be low. This information reflects the current situation in Miami-Dade County, Florida. CDC will provide updates if the situation changes.  Timeline  On June 2, 2017, CDC removed the yellow area designation for Miami-Dade County. The yellow area designation was lifted because criteria identified in CDC’s Zika Interim Response Plan had been met: more than three mosquito incubation periods (45 days) passed with no additional confirmed local transmission cases and no suspected local transmission cases under investigation with enhanced surveillance in place.  On December 9, 2016, CDC removed the red area designation for the remaining 1.5-square-mile area of South Miami Beach after three mosquito incubation periods (45 days) passed without any new locally transmitted cases of Zika. Guidance for yellow areas now applies to the South Miami Beach area and all of Miami-Dade County.  On December 2, 2016, CDC removed the red area designation for the 1-square-mile area of Little River after more than three mosquito incubation periods (45 days) passed without any new locally transmitted cases of Zika. Guidance for yellow areas now applies to the Little River area.  On November 21, 2016, CDC updated guidance for the 4.5-square-mile area of Miami Beach. The North and South Miami Beach sections are being considered separately again because no new cases of local Zika virus transmission were identified in the North Miami Beach area after three mosquito incubation periods passed (45 days), suggesting that the risk of Zika virus infection in North Miami Beach is no longer greater than in the rest of Miami-Dade County. The original 1.5-square-mile area of South Miami Beach for which guidance was issued on September 17 will remain a red area until 45 days pass without new cases. The remainder of Miami-Dade County is designated as a Zika cautionary area ( yellow area ). Guidance for yellow areas now applies to North Miami Beach.  On October 19, because local spread of Zika virus continued to be reported in Miami-Dade County, CDC updated its travel and testing guidance to apply recommendations to all of Miami-Dade County.  On October 13, Florida announced a new area of mosquito-borne spread of Zika in an additional 1-square-mile area of Little River in Miami-Dade County, FL.  On September 19, CDC updated guidance for the Wynwood-designated area after three mosquito incubation periods passed without any new locally transmitted cases of Zika.  On August 19, CDC also issued guidance for a 1.5-square-mile section of South Miami Beach identified to have mosquito-borne spread of Zika; on September 17, this section was expanded to a 4.5-square-mile area that included areas of North Miami Beach.  On August 1, 2016, CDC issued guidance for people living in or traveling to a 1-square-mile area of the Wynwood neighborhood in Miami, FL, identified by the Florida Department of Health as having mosquito-borne spread of Zika.  For questions on mosquito control in Florida  Florida health officials can answer specific questions on Florida’s mosquito control program. Aerial treatment of areas with products that rapidly reduce the populations of mosquitoes can help to limit the number of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus. Repeated aerial applications of insecticide has reduced mosquito populations as a part of an integrated mosquito management program.

Credit: Rhona Wise Getty Images Advertisement  Local transmission of the Zika virus in Florida may have occurred as early as June 15 of last year and likely infected people who lived not only in Miami-Dade County, but in two nearby counties, U.S. health officials said on Monday.  The warning means that some men who donated semen to sperm banks in the area may not have been aware that they were at risk of infection, and may have donated sperm infected with the Zika virus, officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration told reporters in a telephone briefing.  The information is concerning because Zika has been shown to cause birth defects in women who become infected while pregnant. Previously, the CDC had warned of the risk of Zika in Miami-Dade County, beginning on July 29.  But the new warning dials that risk back to June 15, and adds in both Broward and Palm Beach Counties, home to the major tourist destinations of Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach.  Zika's arrival in Florida last summer followed the rapid spread of the mosquito-borne virus through Latin America and the Caribbean.  The World Health Organization last year declared Zika a global health emergency because of its link in Brazil with thousands cases of the birth defect microcephaly, which is marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains that can result in severe developmental problems.  U.S. officials said because of frequent travel between the three Florida counties, some women may have been infected and not been aware of it, either through contracting the infection directly from a mosquito bite while visiting Miami-Dade or through sex with an infected partner who had.  And because Zika has been shown to last up to three months in semen, it may mean some men living in the affected counties may have donated sperm without reporting they were at risk.  CDC Zika expert Dr. Denise Jamieson said the risk applies "particularly (to) women who became pregnant or are planning to become pregnant through the use of donor semen." She urged these women to "consult their healthcare provider to discuss the donation source and whether Zika virus testing is indicated."  The new warning came to light through investigations of several cases of Zika reported by the Florida Health Department late last year that suggested residents of Palm Beach or Broward counties may have become infected while traveling back and forth from Miami-Dade. According to the CDC, a total of 215 people are believed to have contracted Zika in Florida last year through the bite of a local mosquito. But since only one in five people infected with Zika become ill, experts believe the actual number was higher.  Officials said they weren't aware of any women who contracted Zika from infected semen donated to one of the 12 sperm banks in the three-county area. There is no approved test for Zika in sperm.  Jamieson said the CDC does not have any new evidence of local Zika transmission, but said it may occur again in the coming year, adding that the CDC was "on the lookout for additional cases of Zika."  A recent CDC study estimates that Zika infections cause a twenty-fold spike in the risk of certain birth defects, including microcephaly.

CBS News        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Florida is now Zika-free, U.S. health officials reported Friday. One area in south Miami Beach had remained an active zone for local transmission of the virus, which can cause severe birth defects in babies born to women who are infected while pregnant. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that there have been no new cases of local Zika transmission in South Miami Beach for more than 45 days, so that neighborhood is no longer considered an active zone. “Florida’s rapid response and comprehensive mosquito control program has allowed them to interrupt Zika transmission, but we must stay vigilant and also take what we have learned and be prepared for next season,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a news release. And he added a caveat. “Pregnant women who live or have been to this area should continue to be evaluated for Zika exposure during their prenatal visits to prevent the devastating effects Zika can cause in their infants,” Frieden said.     12  Photos   Portraits of Zika babies  After documenting the Zika crisis for a year, Associated Press photographer Felipe Dana gave his subjects the gift of family portraits   Florida is the only state to have confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika infection . But Texas officials, who recently reported a suspected case of local infection , said Friday that they have identified four more cases of suspected locally transmitted Zika virus in Cameron County, near the border with Mexico. The additional cases involve patients who live close to the first suspected case. Though the investigation is ongoing, the infections were likely acquired in that immediate area last month, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). None of the cases involve pregnant women , officials said. “The combination of mosquito control and colder weather has decreased mosquito activity in Cameron County and greatly decreased the probability of more widespread mosquito transmission of Zika right now,” Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner, said in a news release. “However, winters are mild in southern Texas, and mosquito populations can rebound even during short periods of warmer weather. Whenever you see mosquito activity, protect yourself and your family from bites.” Texas officials offered these Zika-protection tips: use EPA-approved insect repellent ; use air conditioning or window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of homes; wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts that cover exposed skin; remove standing water in and around homes that can become mosquito-breeding grounds. As of Dec. 8, an estimated 185 of more than 4,575 reported cases of Zika infection in the United States were spread locally by mosquitoes, according to the CDC. Most of the infections reported in the United States occurred in areas of Latin America and the Caribbean, where Zika cases have been at epidemic proportions. The virus is typically spread through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, although it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. Most adults who are infected with Zika experience mild symptoms. But, the babies of women who are infected while pregnant can experience devastating birth defects, the most common of which is microcephaly, where the brain is underdeveloped and the head is abnormally small.   © 2016 HealthDay.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .

For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

That's just one way health officials are battling back Zika-carrying mosquitoes in the area.  Joe Raedle/Getty Images     As expected, the Zika outbreak in Florida is growing — though how fast is still difficult to say.  State and federal health officials  say mosquitoes are spreading Zika in two neighborhoods of Miami, including Miami Beach. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told pregnant women Friday not to go into these neighborhoods — and to consider postponing travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County.  Just 37 people have been reported to have  caught the virus in these neighborhoods so far.  But many scientists are concerned that the outbreak in Florida may be larger and more widespread than the number of cases suggests.  "Zika is one of those diseases that is always like an iceberg — you just see the tip," says Alessandro Vespignani , a computer scientist at Northeastern University in Boston, who has been tasked with modeling the spread of the virus.  Most people who get Zika don't even know they have it, Vespignani explains. About 4 in 5 people don't have any symptoms, he says. And those who do get sick often have only mild symptoms that could be confused with the flu. So only about 5 percent of cases get detected, Vespignani has found .     To get better estimates of the number of silent infections in Miami and beyond, Vespignani and his colleagues built computer models that estimate how the virus is likely to spread.  "We estimate there will be 395 infected people by Sept. 15 [in Florida]," says Ira Longini , a biostatistician at the University of Florida, who collaborates with Vespignani.  About 80 of those people will show symptoms, Longini estimates. And about eight pregnant women are likely to get infected during their first trimester — which would put their fetuses at risk for microcephaly.  The number of Zika cases in Florida will very likely continue to rise until October or November, when cooler weather stops the mosquitoes, Longini says, though a number of variables could speed the spread before that.  " For example, on Monday the University of Florida opens its first day of classes," he says. "Tens of thousands of students will be coming from the Miami area, as well as from all over Latin America. So we could see a burst of cases by mid-September here in Gainesville."  Because of these uncertainties, many doctors around the country are recommending that their pregnant patients — and those trying to get pregnant — not travel to southern Florida.  And Florida isn't the only place in the continental U.S. at risk.  Longini has used the computer models to predict where Zika could show up next in the States. He says the big concern is Texas — which has roughly a 25 percent chance of having a small outbreak in the next month, according to the models.  "I would not be surprised if we see cases in Texas and Louisiana," Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told  ABC News Sunday, citing the flooding in Louisiana as something Zika watchers will be keeping an eye on.  "There's going to be a lot of problems getting rid of standing water [there]," Fauci says — puddles where Zika-carrying mosquitoes could breed and thrive.     zika  pregnant women  mathematical modeling  Miami  STD  Florida       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

Still, doctors say, pregnant women should continue to take extra precautions.  Joe Raedle/Getty Images     There's no doubt about it: Zika is on the retreat in the Americas.   In Brazil, cases are down by 95 percent from last year. Across the Caribbean, outbreaks have subsided. And in Florida, the virus seems to have gone into hiding. Health officials haven't investigated a new Zika case for more than 45 days in Miami-Dade County.      Shots - Health News  Miami's Zika Outbreak Began Months Before It Was First Detected        Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted the last travel warning for southern Florida. The agency is no longer recommending that pregnant women avoid the region.  "That's really exciting news," says Dr. Christine Curry , an OB-GYN at the University of Miami and Jackson Memorial Hospital. "Everybody has sort of exhaled."  But the threat to pregnant women, whether residents or travelers,  isn't over — not in the least — Curry says, neither in Florida nor abroad.  So what should pregnant women and their families, or women who are trying to get pregnant, do? Let's start with Florida. Then we'll swing back to the international question at the end.  Living or traveling in South Florida  "We can't go back to the days before Zika, where you just walked around without thinking about bug spray or the clothes you're wearing," Curry says. "People still need to practice good mosquito-bite prevention when they're living in South Florida or traveling there."         Goats and Soda  Is Zika Dangerous For Kids? It Probably Depends On The Age        The CDC outlines the precautions needed in Miami-Dade County and other areas of the U.S. where Zika has circulated, such as Brownsville, Texas.  These precautions are most important for pregnant women, those trying to get pregnant and their mates. For example:   Expectant couples should continue to use condoms "every time they have sex (including vaginal, anal, and oral sex)," the CDC writes, because the Zika virus can stay in the semen of an infected man for months.  Pregnant women should continue to get tested for Zika up to eight weeks after the travel ban has been lifted for a region — which would be until about August of 2017 for South Florida.   Such precautions are important, Curry says, for several reasons.  First, even when it looks like Zika has "disappeared," Curry says, it could still be circulating. About 80 percent people who are infected with the virus don't have any symptoms at all.      Shots - Health News  51 Babies Born With Zika-Related Birth Defects In The U.S. Last Year        And if the virus is merely lurking below detectable levels, Zika cases could start cropping up again  at any moment. Last summer, Zika likely circulated in Florida for months before it was detected by health officials, a recent study found .  So if you live in South Florida, or are headed there this summer, pack the DEET , cover clothes in permethrin and be on the lookout for skeeters.  Traveling overseas  Although Zika cases have dropped across the Caribbean and Latin America, the CDC's travel recommendations haven't changed. Pregnant women should not travel to places where Zika is circulating. If a spouse travels to one of these areas, the couple should use condoms for at least six months.  Couples trying to get pregnant should also not travel to these regions. If they must, the CDC recommends waiting at least six months before trying to conceive after a man returns from a country with Zika and waiting at least eight weeks after a woman returns.  Fetal medicine expert Dr. Neil Silverman worries that some doctors are forgetting to give their patients  these travel warnings.  "We've gotten calls at our practice from women who have traveled to areas where's there's clearly active transmission of Zika," says Silverman, an OB-GYN at the Center for Fetal Medicine in Los Angeles.  "Either their doctors have essentially decided the risk is over or the woman forgot to ask. Then they come back home and realize that there was a risk."  Even if a country has reported only a few cases — or hasn't had a case in months — Silverman says the recommendations are the same.  Take for instance, India, which reported its first official cases in May. There were only three cases recorded, across the entire country. But the virus has likely been circulating in India for decades, studies show. And pregnant women should avoid travel there, Silverman says.  " For the purpose of a traveler, there's not a huge distinction between whether a country has a large number of new cases occurring or whether there's sort of a background, long-standing risk," he says.  Places with this sort of background risk include large parts of Southeast Asia and Africa.  So if you're pregnant or "trying," check out the CDC's Zika map before booking a plane ticket, and avoid all the areas that are purple on the map.  "With everything else going on in the country and in the world, Zika has taken a little bit of a backseat in the news cycle," Silverman says. "But it's still a big concern."     zika  Caribbean  birth defects  Travel  Florida       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

Short answer: yes. “Our general advice is that if you are pregnant, you should not go to places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing,” says Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “It’s all a matter of risk. Obviously, if you are staying in an air-conditioned hotel, your risk may be less. However, are you willing to take that risk? We know the consequences of infection of the fetus are huge and lifelong.”      Petersen recommends people check the CDC website for guidance on what locations have active Zika transmission. The CDC updates this list regularly, sometimes on a daily basis. If an area is no longer on the list, Petersen says it’s considered safe to travel. Currently, the CDC recommends that if a pregnant woman or her partner travel to an area with Zika, the couple should use condoms every time they have sex or avoid sex for the rest of the pregnancy, even if they do not have symptoms of Zika.

Women who are planning to get pregnant, and their partners, should also pay attention to where they are traveling. The first trimester, during which women may not know they are pregnant, appears to be the most risky time when it comes to Zika-related health complications for infants down the line.    The CDC recommends that women who travel to areas with Zika who want to get pregnant in the near future wait at least eight weeks after their last possible exposure to the virus before trying to conceive. For male partners, the CDC advises waiting six months after the last possible exposure before trying to conceive. Using condoms is also recommended for the waiting period.  What if I am invited to a destination wedding in a place with Zika? Should I not go?  It may be challenging to get a firm yes or no from your doctor about whether or not you should travel for a major event, though the recommendations are not to go to places with active Zika transmission if you’re pregnant or want to be soon. “My job is to give guidance; I never tell people what to do,” says Dr. Richard Beigi, the chief medical officer of the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “But I think the travel warnings are there for a reason, and nothing has changed from last year other than the fact that we have more information that has validated that Zika causes congenital health problems. The overall risk is the same.”      Deciding to travel despite the risk is ultimately a personal decision. “I ask my patients, ‘Do you really need to go?’ For some people, the answer to that is yes, and that’s fine, and I give them the best advice I can,” Beigi says.  Should I worry about traveling to places that have the types of mosquitoes that can spread Zika?  The CDC recently reported that the types of mosquito that carry Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , are appearing in more counties in the southern U.S. where they haven’t been before. But unless the mosquitoes are transmitting Zika, there’s a “very, very, very low risk,” Petersen says. “In all of the places where we have this kind of mosquito that can spread Zika virus, we also see the kinds of mosquitoes that can spread West Nile and other diseases,” says Petersen. “General mosquito precautions in the summer are important for everybody—not only pregnant women.”      How likely is it that I will get Zika?  Experts can’t give a definitive answer to a person’s chances of getting Zika if they travel to a place that has reported spread of the disease. But experts are getting closer to understanding the likelihood of adverse events should a pregnant woman get infected.  A recent study found that one in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. with a Zika infection had a baby with brain damage or other serious birth defects. The first trimester was the most critical time: 15% of women with confirmed Zika infection in the first trimester had babies with birth defects. Another study found similar numbers for women in U.S. territories, revealing that during their first trimester, nearly 1 in 12 had a baby or fetus with Zika-associated birth defects.      “Out of the data collected, it appears that 5-10% of the time a woman gets Zika during her pregnancy, there will be in impact,” says Beigi. “Most of the impact is a malfunction; some of it is miscarriage. Probably the absolute risk of you having a problem is not very big, but it’s not zero, and it’s hard to know.”  How bad will Zika get in the U.S. this summer?  It’s unclear how many cases of Zika will be expected in and outside the U.S. this summer, though experts say it could be lower than last year. “Based on historical evidence, we would expect that outbreaks this year throughout the Western Hemisphere are going to be less than they were the year before,” says Petersen. “It’s not going away, but since a lot of people have already been infected and are no longer susceptible to infection, it will lower the number of cases over time.”  So far in 2017, about 650 Americans have gotten Zika, though that it is considered an underestimate. Most people do not experience symptoms and will not know they have the virus.

Credit: Rhona Wise Getty Images Advertisement  Local transmission of the Zika virus in Florida may have occurred as early as June 15 of last year and likely infected people who lived not only in Miami-Dade County, but in two nearby counties, U.S. health officials said on Monday.  The warning means that some men who donated semen to sperm banks in the area may not have been aware that they were at risk of infection, and may have donated sperm infected with the Zika virus, officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration told reporters in a telephone briefing.  The information is concerning because Zika has been shown to cause birth defects in women who become infected while pregnant. Previously, the CDC had warned of the risk of Zika in Miami-Dade County, beginning on July 29.  But the new warning dials that risk back to June 15, and adds in both Broward and Palm Beach Counties, home to the major tourist destinations of Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach.  Zika's arrival in Florida last summer followed the rapid spread of the mosquito-borne virus through Latin America and the Caribbean.  The World Health Organization last year declared Zika a global health emergency because of its link in Brazil with thousands cases of the birth defect microcephaly, which is marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains that can result in severe developmental problems.  U.S. officials said because of frequent travel between the three Florida counties, some women may have been infected and not been aware of it, either through contracting the infection directly from a mosquito bite while visiting Miami-Dade or through sex with an infected partner who had.  And because Zika has been shown to last up to three months in semen, it may mean some men living in the affected counties may have donated sperm without reporting they were at risk.  CDC Zika expert Dr. Denise Jamieson said the risk applies "particularly (to) women who became pregnant or are planning to become pregnant through the use of donor semen." She urged these women to "consult their healthcare provider to discuss the donation source and whether Zika virus testing is indicated."  The new warning came to light through investigations of several cases of Zika reported by the Florida Health Department late last year that suggested residents of Palm Beach or Broward counties may have become infected while traveling back and forth from Miami-Dade. According to the CDC, a total of 215 people are believed to have contracted Zika in Florida last year through the bite of a local mosquito. But since only one in five people infected with Zika become ill, experts believe the actual number was higher.  Officials said they weren't aware of any women who contracted Zika from infected semen donated to one of the 12 sperm banks in the three-county area. There is no approved test for Zika in sperm.  Jamieson said the CDC does not have any new evidence of local Zika transmission, but said it may occur again in the coming year, adding that the CDC was "on the lookout for additional cases of Zika."  A recent CDC study estimates that Zika infections cause a twenty-fold spike in the risk of certain birth defects, including microcephaly.

Why? A sudden surge in Brazilian babies born with microcephaly – a birth defect caused by the Zika infection during pregnancy – sparked massive concern and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a public health emergency. The disease is also linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis.  But there’s an added twist that makes this situation even more complex: Brazil, the country at the center of the current Zika crisis, is slated to host nearly 500,000 visitors this summer. Media attention on the problem has exploded, and experts are even debating whether visitors and athletes should make the trip.  At Casino.org, we’re very familiar with odds – so we decided to calculate the likelihood of the average person contracting Zika this summer in Rio. How does the risk of Zika compare with the risk of other illnesses and accidents? What percentage of the U.S. population currently has the disease? And what are the real odds of catching Zika in Rio this summer? Is the Zika/Rio debate truly a global health crisis – or a case of media hype? Read on to get the full story.    What Do You Have a Greater Chance of Dying From?  So you’ve booked your flight to Rio, and planned your accommodations. What’s the likelihood that you’ll make it back home without catching Zika? Pretty decent: 99.999996 percent.   Another way to gain perspective is to compare your 0.000004 percent chance of contracting Zika in Rio this summer with the odds of dying from various other conditions. Only one person has died in the continental U.S. from Zika as of July 11. You are more than twice as likely to die from legal execution, 73 times more likely to die from choking on food, and over 2,212 times more likely to die in an automobile crash than to even contract Zika in Rio.     How Many Times More Likely Is ...  Should you head to Brazil this summer, you can rest easy when it comes to worrying about Zika: You only have a 1 in 250,000 chance of contracting the virus. By our reckoning, you have a lot more to worry about before you stress about that.   You're thousands of times more likely to die from an auto accident than you are likely to contract Zika in Rio. You’re also hundreds of times more likely to die from a shooting or drowning. Even the most random fatal accidents are more probable: Falling, air accidents, and even lightning strikes should worry you more than contracting Zika.     Zika Infections Across the Country  Zika is making headlines across the United States and around the globe – so we took a look at actual known cases of the virus among people within the United States . First of all, every known case of Zika in the U.S. is associated with travel to an outbreak area or sex with an infected person – there are no known cases of Zika caused by a mosquito bite on American soil as of July 11.  Washington, D.C., tops the list for highest percentage of Zika cases: 0.000893 percent of the population has contracted the disease. New York, Hawaii, and Florida have the next highest rates. In five states – Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, and Alaska – there are no known cases of Zika at all.     Comparing Zika With Ebola, Malaria, and Other Diseases  Zika is constantly being discussed in the media, but how does it compare to other buzzed-about diseases? In the past decade, Ebola, malaria, and the West Nile virus have had just as much media coverage. In 2014, the United States was in an Ebola panic , and many were afraid they would contract Ebola.   While it’s 53 times more likely a resident of the United States will contract Zika over Ebola, those odds were during Ebola’s peak in 2014 and the Zika odds require a trip to Rio this summer. Here in the U.S., your odds of contracting Ebola and Zika are slim, and you are much more likely of contracting a severe form of West Nile disease or even malaria. Your best bet? Wear bug spray and see a doctor if you display any symptoms.    Contracting Zika or Dengue Fever in Rio  As we’ve discovered, the likelihood of contracting Zika this summer isn’t particularly high. It’s much more likely you’d catch a cold or some other common illness from someone beside you in the stands. But what about another mosquito-borne disease?  Dengue fever is a major risk for people who reside in the tropics and subtropics. It is a leading cause of illness and even death in those regions. No vaccine exists, so the best protection is to simply avoid mosquito bites.   Of the nearly half a million projected visitors to Rio this summer, odds are that only two may contract Zika. On the other hand, chances are that about 279 Rio visitors could contract dengue fever.     What Else Is More Likely?  Asteroids. UFOs. Four-leaf clovers. They’re the stuff of dreams – or in some cases, nightmares. But, amazingly, you’re likelier to encounter one of these than you are to become a victim of Zika. For instance, a person is 25 times likelier to find a four-leaf clover on their first try than to contract Zika in Rio this summer.   In addition, a woman in the United States is 8 times more likely to spot a UFO than to give birth to a baby with microcephaly as a result of Zika contracted in Rio.    Calculating the Odds  As you can see, the odds of contracting Zika in Rio this summer are astronomically slim. However, the debate rages on .   Zika is a serious disease, and even one case is a case too many. However, of those who become infected, 8 in 10 don’t even display symptoms, and the remaining 2 in 10 usually aren’t ill enough to require medical treatment. Zika’s greatest danger, by far, is to pregnant women.  It’s always important to do the research, weigh the risks, and calculate the odds.

Here are 9 facts to calm you down.   By  Julia Belluz and Brian Resnick   Updated Aug 23, 2016, 11:38am EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Zika is spreading in Florida. Here are 9 facts to calm you down.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email             With Zika moving through nearly every country in the Western Hemisphere over the past year and a half, it was only a matter of time before the virus made its way to the continental US.  At the end of July, health officials announced that a handful of Zika infections had originated from mosquitoes in Miami, Florida. As of August 22 , there were 37 locally-acquired cases in Florida, mostly concentrated in a one square mile area  of Miami's Wynwood neighborhood.  Zika was discovered in the 1940s, but most people had never heard of it until last year. That's because for decades, Zika outbreaks were sporadic and tiny, and the disease seemed to do little harm.   Related   Zika in Florida, explained in 600 words     That changed in 2015. A massive outbreak in Brazil altered the scientific community's view of the mosquito-borne virus. Scientists learned that Zika can actually be a lot more dangerous than anyone thought, causing devastating birth defects in fetuses and even miscarriages. In light of that, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency on February 1 this year.  Meanwhile, the virus has been on the move. To date, more than 60 countries and territories have reported mosquito transmission of the virus, and 11 countries have seen sexual transmission of Zika. The US is only the latest country to grapple with a Zika virus outbreak.  1) Zika is spreading locally in Florida — but don't expect it to go very far  Here's a quick recap of what's going on in Florida, the only state so far with native Zika transmission: On July 19 , health officials announced that a woman living in Miami-Dade County, Florida, had tested positive for the mosquito-borne and sexually transmitted virus. But unlike all of the other Zika cases reported in the US at the time, she had no travel history to a country with Zika.  Since then, a small number of people in the area seem to have been similarly infected by local mosquitoes. The 37 cases are mostly concentrated in a  one square mile area of Miami's Wynwood neighborhood .           Florida Department of Health     But the virus is spreading. On August 19, health officials confirmed  that five new cases had sprung up in the Miami Beach area — outside the  one square mile in Wynwood. Another case has since popped up near Tampa , on the other side of Florida.  In response, the CDC expanded their travel advisory , warning pregnant women to avoid the part of Miami Beach where Zika is spreading, as well as the Wynwood area. They've also advised pregnant women and their partners to consider avoiding nonessential travel to Miami-Dade. According to the  New York Times , this is likely to "threaten tourism in South Florida and deepen fears among pregnant women living in the area."  A small Zika outbreak in Florida wouldn't exactly be surprising. Zika has been identified in mosquitoes in more than 60 countries and territories over the past year, and the CDC has warned that the southeastern part of the US — particularly Florida and Texas — was at risk of outbreaks during mosquito season this year. It’s the region where the Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes thrive in the greatest concentrations.  There have already been more than 2,200 travel-related Zika cases in the US, while some 8,000 people in US territories (mainly Puerto Rico) have acquired the virus locally.          Where Zika is likely to spread.  PLoS Currents    But don't panic. Officials expect that Zika will likely follow the same pattern in the continental US as dengue fever, leading to small outbreaks in the southeastern US.  "Better housing construction, regular use of air conditioning, use of window screens and door screens and state and local mosquito control efforts helped to eliminate [mosquito-borne infections like malaria] from the mainland," said Lyle Petersen, director of the CDC's division of vector-borne diseases, in a statement this year. All these factors are expected to prevent widespread transmission here.  2) About 80 percent of people don't experience any symptoms with Zika  The vast majority of people who get Zika won’t even know they have it. A minority — roughly 20 percent — show relatively minor symptoms: a low-grade fever, sore body, and headache, as well as red eyes and a body rash. More rarely, this might include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. These symptoms usually appear two to 12 days after a bite and go away within a week, and with the same type of care as the flu — bed rest, fluids, etc.          A rash caused by Zika virus.  (Emerging Infectious Diseases)    There’s no vaccine or cure for the virus. But severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon, as is death from the virus. Once a person has been infected with Zika, they are thought to develop lifelong immunity.  But that's not the whole story. In rare occasions, Zika causes really serious health complications.  In both the Brazil and French Polynesia outbreaks , researchers noted that some people infected with the virus were later diagnosed with Guillain-Barré, a rare and sometimes deadly neurological condition in which people's immune systems damage their nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis. The symptoms can last weeks, months, or even years.  Again, though, this is rare: about one in 4,000 Zika cases, according to the WHO . And it’s not unique to Zika. Other viral diseases — like dengue and chikungunya — also cause Guillain-Barré.  More worryingly, Zika seems to have a particular appetite for the neurological cells of fetuses. When a pregnant woman catches the virus, her fetus faces a risk of severe birth defects, including microcephaly, which is characterized by a shrunken head and incomplete brain development.  The association between microcephaly and Zika has been seen in this outbreak in Brazil, as well as in reanalyses of the data from previous outbreaks, such as one in the French Polynesian islands in 2013 to 2014 .  In addition, researchers have found that the virus seems to kill off the tissue in entire regions of the fetus’s brain, damage babies' eyes and ears,  and heighten the risk of miscarriage.  3) One percent of pregnant women who get Zika will have birth complications  The risk of birth complications is low. The WHO estimates that the fetuses of one in 100 women with Zika will go on to develop microcephaly or other abnormalities. And researchers believe the risks of Zika-related birth defects are greatest if a woman is infected in the first trimester of her pregnancy.          Countries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection as of July 14, 2016.  PAHO    Zika isn’t the first virus to cause microcephaly. Rubella famously caused an epidemic of birth defects before the advent of the vaccine, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) can damage fetuses too.  But Zika is the first mosquito-borne virus to threaten fetuses. And even if these birth defects turn out to be a very rare complication of Zika, the risk to fetuses was enough to prompt the WHO to declare a rare global public health emergency earlier this year.  4) We don't fully understand all the ways Zika spreads  Zika is mainly carried by a specific type of mosquito called Aedes aegypti , which spreads the disease through bites.  What makes the Aedes aegypti a unique threat is that it is remarkably effective at carrying viruses — it's also the primary vector of the yellow fever, dengue, and chikungunya viruses.  Aedes mosquitoes are incredibly well-adapted to thrive alongside humans. They can breed and rest in small pools of water and moist environments around people's homes. (You can see examples of the mosquito's main aquatic habitats here , ranging from rain-filled cavities in trees to outdoor pots and animal drinking pans.) This is different from other types of mosquitoes, which prefer larger bodies of water.  Mosquito transmission, while thought to be the primary method, is not the only way to spread the virus.  As we’ve discussed already, Zika can also be passed from mother to child.  And it can be spread through sex. There have been more than 20 cases of Zika sexual transmission in 10 countries , involving oral, anal, and vaginal sex, and the virus has been shown to spread from women to men , men to men , and men to woman.  People can contract Zika through blood transfusions. In Brazil, there have been multiple reports of Zika spreading through blood transfusions, according to the CDC .  Finally, it's possible Zika can spread through saliva or urine , since live virus has been isolated from these bodily fluids, but there’s not a lot of clarity yet about this mode of transmission.  Researchers are also exploring other potential routes Zika spreads. In a mysterious recent case in Utah , a man who died from Zika passed it on to his caregiver, though the two didn’t engage in sex (the caregiver was reportedly the man’s son ) and officials don't believe Aedes mosquitoes, which carry the virus, were involved, since they aren’t established in Utah.  5) Zika can be sexually transmitted — but simple precautions can reduce the risk  The virus stays in the blood for 11 days on average, and potentially much longer in other bodily fluids.  In men, the virus can persist in semen for more than 180 days (though it's unclear for how long it remains infectious). In women, researchers have found Zika in vaginal fluid 11 days after a woman showed symptoms of infection.  According to Margaret Honein, the CDC’s co-lead of the ‎Pregnancy and Birth Defects Task Force for the Zika response, the latest reported time that a man was able to spread the virus through sex after a Zika illness was between 32 and 41 days.  6) Women exposed to Zika should wait at least eight weeks before becoming pregnant  First things first: If you’re pregnant, avoid mosquito bites, practice safe sex with your partner, and stay out of areas where the virus is spreading.  Researchers believe pregnant women are at the greatest risk of having babies with birth defects if they are infected in the first trimester. (More from the CDC here.)  For couples who are thinking of becoming pregnant soon, the CDC’s recommendations for waiting to conceive vary depending on your likelihood of infection:          CDC    7) Men should avoid infecting a partner who may become pregnant  Again, the most important risk is really to pregnant women and their babies. So for men, the key concern is infecting a partner with Zika who may become pregnant. Either abstain from sex or use condoms for at least a period of eight weeks if you were in a place with Zika but showed no signs of infection, and up to six months if you had symptoms or were diagnosed with the virus (see the above chart for details).  8) If you're at risk of Zika, clean up your house, wear mosquito repellent, and practice safe sex  Since Zika is carried by mosquitoes and there's no vaccine, the best way to prevent outbreaks is to prevent mosquitoes that carry the virus from biting people.  The Aedes mosquitoes that carry Zika prefer small bodies of water around people's homes, so there are measures you can take to really limit mosquitoes' habitats, says Janet McAllister, a researcher in the division of vector-borne diseases at the CDC.  McAllister recommends "just generally keeping your yard clean and in shape, getting rid of debris or things stored outside that can hold water, or adjusting them so that they no longer hold water." She adds, "It's also important to maintain the vegetation in your yard — to keep the grass mowed and bushes trimmed, with good air flow."  Inside the home , the CDC recommends making sure you have screens on windows and doors that aren't punctured in any way. Wearing protective clothing, using insect repellents, and keeping your house cool with air conditioning also helps.  Since Zika can be spread through sexual contact, practicing safe sex (using condoms) with partners that may have come into contact with the virus is recommended, too. (See points 6 and 7.)  9) Before 2007, there were only 14 documented Zika cases  Zika is actually an old virus that only recently began to worry health experts. It was discovered in 1947 when it was isolated from monkeys in the Zika forest in Uganda. And for decades thereafter, it seemed to be barely bother humans.  Prior to 2007, there were only 14 documented Zika cases . But then the first big outbreak erupted on Yap island in Micronesia , with 49 confirmed cases. And from there, the virus was on the move.  Soon cases popped up in other Pacific islands, including a large outbreak in 2013-'14 in French Polynesia (388 cases). By May 2015, health officials had detected the virus in Brazil.  Zika has since spread to more than 60 countries and territories — mostly concentrated in Central and South America and the Caribbean. All this means that we're in the throes of the biggest Zika outbreaks in history, and there's still a lot we have to learn about the virus.

CBS News        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Florida is now Zika-free, U.S. health officials reported Friday. One area in south Miami Beach had remained an active zone for local transmission of the virus, which can cause severe birth defects in babies born to women who are infected while pregnant. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that there have been no new cases of local Zika transmission in South Miami Beach for more than 45 days, so that neighborhood is no longer considered an active zone. “Florida’s rapid response and comprehensive mosquito control program has allowed them to interrupt Zika transmission, but we must stay vigilant and also take what we have learned and be prepared for next season,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a news release. And he added a caveat. “Pregnant women who live or have been to this area should continue to be evaluated for Zika exposure during their prenatal visits to prevent the devastating effects Zika can cause in their infants,” Frieden said.     12  Photos   Portraits of Zika babies  After documenting the Zika crisis for a year, Associated Press photographer Felipe Dana gave his subjects the gift of family portraits   Florida is the only state to have confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika infection . But Texas officials, who recently reported a suspected case of local infection , said Friday that they have identified four more cases of suspected locally transmitted Zika virus in Cameron County, near the border with Mexico. The additional cases involve patients who live close to the first suspected case. Though the investigation is ongoing, the infections were likely acquired in that immediate area last month, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). None of the cases involve pregnant women , officials said. “The combination of mosquito control and colder weather has decreased mosquito activity in Cameron County and greatly decreased the probability of more widespread mosquito transmission of Zika right now,” Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner, said in a news release. “However, winters are mild in southern Texas, and mosquito populations can rebound even during short periods of warmer weather. Whenever you see mosquito activity, protect yourself and your family from bites.” Texas officials offered these Zika-protection tips: use EPA-approved insect repellent ; use air conditioning or window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of homes; wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts that cover exposed skin; remove standing water in and around homes that can become mosquito-breeding grounds. As of Dec. 8, an estimated 185 of more than 4,575 reported cases of Zika infection in the United States were spread locally by mosquitoes, according to the CDC. Most of the infections reported in the United States occurred in areas of Latin America and the Caribbean, where Zika cases have been at epidemic proportions. The virus is typically spread through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, although it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. Most adults who are infected with Zika experience mild symptoms. But, the babies of women who are infected while pregnant can experience devastating birth defects, the most common of which is microcephaly, where the brain is underdeveloped and the head is abnormally small.   © 2016 HealthDay.

The Florida Department of Health confirmed the two local cases July 29, 2016. Florida’s first CDC-confirmed travel-related cases were in Miami-Dade and Hillsborough counties six months earlier.  The map below shows when the Florida Department of Health reported cases in each county. In late 2016, the department began including pregnant women and non-residents who were diagnosed in Florida in the state’s county and type-of-transmission totals.

In February 2016, the CDC began to issue weekly counts of cases reported by states and territories of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases. In February 2017, the CDC began issuing weekly counts of blood donors whose blood tested positive for the Zika virus regardless of being symptomatic.

The Zika virus causes a serious birth defect called microcephaly — an underdeveloped brain and small head — and is linked to other neurological disorders in adults. Roughly 4 in 5 infected people are asymptomatic, but the disease’s most common symptoms are mild and include fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes.  The virus is primarily spread through mosquito bites and can also be transmitted through sex and blood transfusions.  A public health emergency of international concern was declared by the World Health Organization on Feb. 1, 2016, as the virus spread through Latin America and the Caribbean. WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan declared the end of the emergency on November 18, 2016, and on February 1 she stated : “WHO and affected countries need to manage Zika not on an emergency footing, but in the same sustained way we respond to other established epidemic-prone pathogens.”    Severe birth defects  The CDC has confirmed the Zika virus causes microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. It can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus during pregnancy. The agency advises women who are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant not to travel to Zika-affected areas.  If a pregnant woman’s partner has been to such an area, the couple should abstain from sex or use condoms during the pregnancy. Currently, the CDC does not believe there is risk for the future pregnancies of a woman who has Zika once the virus clears from her blood.    Mosquito control is key  Zika is primarily spread to people through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito — the same kind that causes dengue and chikungunya viruses.  To keep mosquitoes from multiplying, the Florida Department of Health recommends draining standing water once or twice a week. Garbage cans, bird baths and pool covers are all prime breeding grounds. Miami-Dade County residents can request a mosquito inspection or report a mosquito nuisance by calling 3-1-1 .  The department also recommends using screens to cover doors and windows. To avoid bites while outside, cover skin with clothing and use mosquito repellent. Those with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and IR3535 are effective. Florida has a Zika Virus Information Hotline managed by the Department of Health that can be reached at 1-855-622-6735 .

Influenza can cause mild to severe illness. 
                    Serious outcomes of flu infection are hospitalization or death.  Florida is currently experiencing a moderately severe influenza season. The best way to protect yourself from flu is to get vaccinated, practice good hand washing hygiene, and stay home/keep children home when sick.

There are no new travel-related cases to report today. Please visit our website to see the full list of travel-related cases by county and year. The department updates the travel-related case chart online each weekday.  There are three locally acquired cases being reported today. Two are cases that had samples collected in October as part of our ongoing investigation and the department just received confirmatory testing back from CDC. These two cases have been added to the 2016 chart.  The third case reported no symptoms, but screening conducted after blood donation in January showed evidence of a past infection. The department concluded our investigation of this case yesterday. This individual had multiple exposures in Miami-Dade County and likely contracted Zika in 2016. Because the individual was asymptomatic, it is difficult to determine when infection occurred. Since the first positive sample was collected in January, this is considered our first locally reported case of Zika in 2017. Florida still does not have any identified areas with ongoing, active Zika transmission.    The total number of Zika cases reported in Florida for 2016 is 1,384. The total number of Zika cases reported in Florida for 2017 is 18.    2016       Infection Type    Infection Count      Travel-Related Infections Of Zika    1076      Locally Acquired Infections Of Zika    276      Undetermined    32      .

Pregnant Women With Lab-Evidence Of Zika    4      Florida no longer has any identified areas with active Zika transmission, but we will continue to see isolated cases of local transmission so it is important for residents and visitors in Miami-Dade County to remain vigilant about mosquito bite protection.  It is important for people to remember to take proper precautions to prevent mosquito bites while traveling to areas with widespread Zika transmission. The CDC list of these locations is available here .  One case does not mean ongoing active transmission is taking place. DOH conducts a thorough investigation by sampling close contacts and community members around each case to determine if additional people are infected. If DOH finds evidence that active transmission is occurring in an area, the media and the public will be notified.  The department has conducted Zika virus testing for more than 12,700 people statewide. Florida currently has the capacity to test 4,653 people for active Zika virus and 5,152 for Zika antibodies. At Governor Scott’s direction, all county health departments now offer free Zika risk assessment and testing to pregnant women.  The CDC advises pregnant women should consider postponing travel to Miami-Dade County. If you are pregnant and must travel or if you live or work in Miami-Dade County, protect yourself from mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, long clothing and limiting your time outdoors.  According to CDC guidance, providers should test all pregnant women who lived in, traveled to or whose partner traveled to Miami-Dade County after Aug. 1, 2016. Pregnant women in Miami-Dade County can contact their medical provider or their local county health department to be tested and receive a Zika prevention kit. Additionally, the department is working closely with the Healthy Start Coalition of Miami-Dade County to identify pregnant women in Miami-Dade County to ensure they have access to resources and information to protect themselves. CDC recommends that a pregnant woman with a history of Zika virus and her provider should consider additional ultrasounds.  Pregnant women can contact their local county health department for Zika risk assessment and testing hours and information. A Zika risk assessment will be conducted by county health department staff and blood and/or urine samples may be collected and sent to labs for testing. It may take one to two weeks to receive results.  Florida has been monitoring pregnant women with evidence of Zika regardless of symptoms. The total number of pregnant women who have been or are being monitored is 264.  On Feb. 12, Governor Scott directed the State Surgeon General to activate a Zika Virus Information Hotline for current Florida residents and visitors, as well as anyone planning on traveling to Florida in the near future. The number for the Zika Virus Information Hotline is 1-855-622-6735 .  The department urges Floridians to drain standing water weekly, no matter how seemingly small. A couple drops of water in a bottle cap can be a breeding location for mosquitoes. Residents and visitors also need to use repellents when enjoying the Florida outdoors.
