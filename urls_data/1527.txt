Identical Quadruplets Born: 1 in 13 Million   By ABC News  Aug. 22, 2007   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The chances of having quadruplets is about one in 800,000. The chances of having a set of identical quadruplets is one in 11 million to 15 million. On Aug. 12, four babies beat the odds and broke a record at the same time. The identical Jepp quadruplets were born in four quick minutes in Great Falls, Mont. The four identical baby girls — Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia — were delivered in the Benefis Healthcare System to proud parents Karen and J.P. "As any parent will tell you, bringing a new life into the world is an amazing wonderful thing, and we've got four amazing wonderful things," new dad J.P. said. The Jepps live in Calgary, Canada, but were sent to the states after learning that every single neonatal unit in Canada was too crowded to handle four premature births. One long hour after Karen Jepp went into labor and dozens of frantic phone calls later, the Jepps found Benefis Healthcare System in Montana — 300 miles away. They were on a plane shortly thereafter. "The nurses have been wonderful and really helped us out because we have no idea what we're doing," Karen said. The girls were delivered by Caesarean section after 31 weeks. All are in good health and breathing without ventilators. The girls were conceived without the help of fertility drugs; one egg split three times to produce four babies. With the babies traveling two to an incubator, the new family returned to Calgary in two separate trips; two with dad Thursday, and two with mom Friday. The birth of the Jepp girls marks one of fewer 50 sets of identical quadruplets in documented, medical history. "This is an incredibly rare event. You're talking about a one in 11 [million] to a one in 15 million event," said Jamie Grifo, division director of reproductive endocrinology at NYU Medical Center. Aside from J.P.'s mother, who is a twin, there is no history of multiple births in either parent's family. "My mom is a fraternal twin," J.P. said. "But we're told that doesn't apply in this case. Fraternal abilities may be genetic, but an egg splitting is just a genetic happening." The quads are expected to spend another four to eight weeks in the hospital before heading home with mom and dad to meet their big brother, 2-year-old Simon.        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

The Science of Identical Triplets and Quadruplets  By Laura Geggel, Senior Writer | October 28, 2015 09:49am ET                            MORE            Credit: A.G.A | Shutterstock.com     For two Baltimore parents, their three new bundles of joy may make them feel like one in a million, and statistics show they're not far off: Parents Thomas and Kristen Hewitt welcomed a rare set of identical triplets earlier this month, The Baltimore Sun reports.  The Hewitts' three boys were born more than six weeks early, on Oct. 6, the Sun reported . But having identical triplets is exceedingly rare, said Dr. Jonathan Herman, an OB-GYN at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, who was not involved in the triplets' care.  Statistics help tell the story: Without the help of fertility treatments, and according to a mathematical rule that doctors use called Hellin's law , about one in 90 births is twins, one in 8,100 births (90 squared) is triplets and one in 729,000 births (90 cubed) is quadruplets, Herman said. [ Seeing Double: 8 Fascinating Facts About Twins ]  However, these numbers include both identical and fraternal babies. Identical siblings are much more rare: Only about one in 250 births is identical twins, according to a 2003 study in the Journal of Biosocial Science . Identical triplets are even less common, occurring about 20 to 30 times per 1 million births, the study found.  During the past few decades, fertility treatments have led to a rise in the rate of twins and other multiple births. For instance, the twin birth rate in the United States has increased more than 75 percent since 1980, and the triplet and high-order multiple births increased at an even higher rate, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .  In 2013, there were about 132,300 twin births, about 4,300 triplet births , 270 quadruplet births, and 66 births of quintuplets or higher-order births, out of about 3.9 million total births in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .   How it happens  There are two main ways twin births occur. In the case of fraternal twins, a woman's ovaries release two eggs at the same time, which are then fertilized by two separate sperm. These babies develop at the same time within the womb, but the two children have the same degree of genetic similarity as any siblings, sharing about 50 percent of their genes.   Identical twins arise via a different route: A single sperm cell fertilizes a single egg, but then the single resulting cell splits into two identical cells, which have the same chromosomes. From this point on, the embryos may grow differently depending on their environments, but their DNA remains the same, Herman said.  In the case of identical triplets or quadruplets, the single fertilized egg splits into three or four genetically identical eggs, Herman said.  It's unknown why a fertilized egg sometimes splits, but identical twins tend to run in families, indicating that there's a genetic component, Herman said.  Researchers have also found some other hints: Studies show that older, as well as larger and taller women are more likely to have twins. The people of certain ethnic groups, including the Yoruba people of central Africa, are also more likely to have twins, whereas other groups, such as people in Asia and Central America, are less likely to have multiple births, a 2011 study in the journal PLOS ONE found.  But these numbers are only for surviving multiples; sometimes, the fetuses of multiple pregnancies don't survive to birth.  "The more babies you have [at once], the more dangerous it is," Herman told Live Science. "There's a saying that twins are twice as much fun for the family, but three times as much trouble for doctors."  Births involving twins, triplets and quadruplets often have complications, including prematurity and low birth weight, Herman said. In those with a condition called twin-twin transfusion, one fetus siphons blood from the other, and is born with ruddy skin, while the other is pale and scrawny, Herman said. Women who carry multiples also have a greater risk of gestational diabetes, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .  But the public continues to be fascinated with twins, and stories about identical triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets tend to make the news.  Such births also make a lot of work for parents. To tell their kids apart, the Hewitts have given each of their three boys differently colored strings to wear on their wrists and ankles, according to the Sun. And Kristen, a cosmetologist, plans to cut the boys' hair in different ways.  But her husband, Thomas, chuckled at the idea, according to the Sun, saying that it "will work, until they realize they can buzz each other's heads."   Follow Laura Geggel on Twitter @LauraGeggel .

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Multiple birth   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical Quadruplets Born: 1 in 13 Million   By ABC News  Aug. 22, 2007   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The chances of having quadruplets is about one in 800,000. The chances of having a set of identical quadruplets is one in 11 million to 15 million. On Aug. 12, four babies beat the odds and broke a record at the same time. The identical Jepp quadruplets were born in four quick minutes in Great Falls, Mont. The four identical baby girls — Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia — were delivered in the Benefis Healthcare System to proud parents Karen and J.P. "As any parent will tell you, bringing a new life into the world is an amazing wonderful thing, and we've got four amazing wonderful things," new dad J.P. said. The Jepps live in Calgary, Canada, but were sent to the states after learning that every single neonatal unit in Canada was too crowded to handle four premature births. One long hour after Karen Jepp went into labor and dozens of frantic phone calls later, the Jepps found Benefis Healthcare System in Montana — 300 miles away. They were on a plane shortly thereafter. "The nurses have been wonderful and really helped us out because we have no idea what we're doing," Karen said. The girls were delivered by Caesarean section after 31 weeks. All are in good health and breathing without ventilators. The girls were conceived without the help of fertility drugs; one egg split three times to produce four babies. With the babies traveling two to an incubator, the new family returned to Calgary in two separate trips; two with dad Thursday, and two with mom Friday. The birth of the Jepp girls marks one of fewer 50 sets of identical quadruplets in documented, medical history. "This is an incredibly rare event. You're talking about a one in 11 [million] to a one in 15 million event," said Jamie Grifo, division director of reproductive endocrinology at NYU Medical Center. Aside from J.P.'s mother, who is a twin, there is no history of multiple births in either parent's family. "My mom is a fraternal twin," J.P. said. "But we're told that doesn't apply in this case. Fraternal abilities may be genetic, but an egg splitting is just a genetic happening." The quads are expected to spend another four to eight weeks in the hospital before heading home with mom and dad to meet their big brother, 2-year-old Simon.        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Courtesy Noelle Mirabella Photography    It’s the first time Jones has ever photographed quadruplets, so the project took much more planning and assistants than she was used to. Five extra people helped her set up the shoot: one person per baby and one person to help arrange the flowers and props. It took three large vehicles to haul all the items needed to the outdoor location in Grande Prairie.

Jones chose white outfits so that she could coordinate all of the different hats without having to change the babies and risk waking them up, she said.  Meanwhile, the tiny sisters are already confounding adults.  “With the exception of the smallest of the girls, Abigail, my assistants and I were not able to tell them apart with their outfits on. Prior to dressing them, we kept checking their hospital bracelets to see who was who,” Jones said.  To help tell them apart, the girls just had their ears pierced with different colored sets of earrings. Abby has blue, Emily has purple, Grace has red and Mckayla has pink, their mom said.

The chance of having quadruplets without fertility drugs is one in 729,000, Dr. James Bofill, a professor of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Mississippi, told TODAY when he treated a Mississippi woman who gave birth to quadruplets in 2014.

		Staff  The Canadian Press           WATCH ABOVE: An Alberta woman, pregnant with identical quadruplets, has recently given birth in Edmonton. On Monday, a couple from Hythe introduced their four new daughters to the world. Carole Anne Devaney reports.                             X               -   A  A   +       Listen            EDMONTON – An Alberta couple will have added reasons to celebrate when they mark their first wedding anniversary next month. Bethani and Tim Webb of Hythe — 500 kilometres northwest of Edmonton — became the parents of four identical baby girls on Friday. The naturally conceived quadruplets were delivered by caesarean section by obstetric and neonatal specialists at an Edmonton hospital.  Story continues below        “Of course, I’m worried about her,” Tim said. “The day of, everything went fine. “It was kind of like a magic show, because they’re pulling out one, two, three, four… It was kind of surreal.” The Webbs were told by a nurse during the pregnancy that the odds of having natural quads are one in 67 million.

It’s overwhelmingly awesome.” The girls have been named Emily, Grace, McKayla and Abigail and weigh between three pounds and four pounds, one ounce. How did the couple pick those names? “We just decided,” Bethani said simply. “Found some we liked and picked them out. It was nice that we didn’t have to pick our favourites. We could just pick four we liked. We didn’t have to choose just one.” “I’m looking forward to the memories,” Tim said, “and how close they’ll all be.” “I can’t wait until they’re home,” Bethani added. “It’s going to be crazy the first few years… It’ll be very exciting.” With files from Global News     Report an error        AHS  Alberta Health Services  Alberta quads  Edmonton Health Matters  Four babies  Hythe  Identical Quadruplets  Identical quads  Naturally conceived identical quads  naturally conceived quadruplets       Editor's Picks          Canada    How Ottawa might try to save the Trans Mountain pipeline          Tech    Two-thirds of Canadians don't trust Facebook with their data, Ipsos poll shows         Politics    UK probing AggregateIQ as part of inquiry into privacy law breach         Canada    Ambassador told to take down tweet about 'pleasing' Myanmar beach due to Canadian cold snap, not ethnic cleansing         Canada    Millennials are confident about buying homes, but many get a boost from mom and dad          Money    Donald Trump keeps attacking Amazon — here's why, and what he's hoping to accomplish          Politics    Bureaucrats working under Harper and Trudeau rejected IBM's advice to delay Phoenix         Canada    Matthew Schrier was kidnapped by al-Qaida in Syria.

The Science of Identical Triplets and Quadruplets  By Laura Geggel, Senior Writer | October 28, 2015 09:49am ET                            MORE            Credit: A.G.A | Shutterstock.com     For two Baltimore parents, their three new bundles of joy may make them feel like one in a million, and statistics show they're not far off: Parents Thomas and Kristen Hewitt welcomed a rare set of identical triplets earlier this month, The Baltimore Sun reports.  The Hewitts' three boys were born more than six weeks early, on Oct. 6, the Sun reported . But having identical triplets is exceedingly rare, said Dr. Jonathan Herman, an OB-GYN at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, who was not involved in the triplets' care.  Statistics help tell the story: Without the help of fertility treatments, and according to a mathematical rule that doctors use called Hellin's law , about one in 90 births is twins, one in 8,100 births (90 squared) is triplets and one in 729,000 births (90 cubed) is quadruplets, Herman said. [ Seeing Double: 8 Fascinating Facts About Twins ]  However, these numbers include both identical and fraternal babies. Identical siblings are much more rare: Only about one in 250 births is identical twins, according to a 2003 study in the Journal of Biosocial Science . Identical triplets are even less common, occurring about 20 to 30 times per 1 million births, the study found.  During the past few decades, fertility treatments have led to a rise in the rate of twins and other multiple births. For instance, the twin birth rate in the United States has increased more than 75 percent since 1980, and the triplet and high-order multiple births increased at an even higher rate, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .  In 2013, there were about 132,300 twin births, about 4,300 triplet births , 270 quadruplet births, and 66 births of quintuplets or higher-order births, out of about 3.9 million total births in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .   How it happens  There are two main ways twin births occur. In the case of fraternal twins, a woman's ovaries release two eggs at the same time, which are then fertilized by two separate sperm. These babies develop at the same time within the womb, but the two children have the same degree of genetic similarity as any siblings, sharing about 50 percent of their genes.   Identical twins arise via a different route: A single sperm cell fertilizes a single egg, but then the single resulting cell splits into two identical cells, which have the same chromosomes. From this point on, the embryos may grow differently depending on their environments, but their DNA remains the same, Herman said.  In the case of identical triplets or quadruplets, the single fertilized egg splits into three or four genetically identical eggs, Herman said.  It's unknown why a fertilized egg sometimes splits, but identical twins tend to run in families, indicating that there's a genetic component, Herman said.  Researchers have also found some other hints: Studies show that older, as well as larger and taller women are more likely to have twins. The people of certain ethnic groups, including the Yoruba people of central Africa, are also more likely to have twins, whereas other groups, such as people in Asia and Central America, are less likely to have multiple births, a 2011 study in the journal PLOS ONE found.  But these numbers are only for surviving multiples; sometimes, the fetuses of multiple pregnancies don't survive to birth.  "The more babies you have [at once], the more dangerous it is," Herman told Live Science. "There's a saying that twins are twice as much fun for the family, but three times as much trouble for doctors."  Births involving twins, triplets and quadruplets often have complications, including prematurity and low birth weight, Herman said. In those with a condition called twin-twin transfusion, one fetus siphons blood from the other, and is born with ruddy skin, while the other is pale and scrawny, Herman said. Women who carry multiples also have a greater risk of gestational diabetes, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .  But the public continues to be fascinated with twins, and stories about identical triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets tend to make the news.  Such births also make a lot of work for parents. To tell their kids apart, the Hewitts have given each of their three boys differently colored strings to wear on their wrists and ankles, according to the Sun. And Kristen, a cosmetologist, plans to cut the boys' hair in different ways.  But her husband, Thomas, chuckled at the idea, according to the Sun, saying that it "will work, until they realize they can buzz each other's heads."   Follow Laura Geggel on Twitter @LauraGeggel .

Abid Katib / Getty Images       More in Ages and Stages        Multiples       Through the Years     Babies     Toddlers     Preschoolers     School-Age Kids     Tweens     Teens        Quintuplets are a set of five offspring born at one birth. An individual that is part of such a set is called a quintuplet and sometimes referred to as a quint . Types of Quintuplets Quintuplets can be fraternal ( multi zygotic ), identical ( monozygotic ) or a combination of both. Multi zygotic quintuplets occur from five unique egg/sperm combinations. Monozygotic multiples are the result of a fertilized egg that splits into two or more embryos.         It is possible for a split to occur more than once, producing ​ monozygotic triplets or even a rare set of monozygotic quintuplets. Fully monozygotic quintuplets are rare, so rare that it is difficult to assess the odds. Quintuplets can be all male, all female, or a combination of both. (Monozygotic quintuplets will always be of the same gender.) Most quintuplets are a combination of boys and girls; all male or all female quintuples are rare. The first set of all-female quintuplets were born in the United States in 2015. In 2008, a Polish woman gave birth to a set of "probably identical" girls without the aid of fertility drugs. Odds of Quintuplets In 2005, the National Vital Statistics report for the United States reported the birth of 68 quintuplets and higher order multiples. Because this number includes the possible birth of sextuplets, septuplets or more, it is not determined exactly how many of those births were quintuplets.   The spontaneous conception of quintuplets is rare, the average estimate is 1 in about 60 million births. Most recent quintuplet births are the result of assisted reproductive techniques such as fertility enhancing drugs or in-vitro fertilization. Quintuplets do not always share the same birthdate. A delayed interval delivery (also known as iatrogenic asynchronous birth) may mean that individual babies are born days or even weeks apart.         Pregnancy With Quintuplets The average gestation for a quintuplet pregnancy is 29 weeks, as opposed to 40 weeks for a full-term baby. The longest gestation I've discovered was 35 weeks, a record held by the mother of the Stanford quintuplets in Rhode Island. Many mothers will gain more than fifty pounds during their pregnancy and will require cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is sewn shut to prevent preterm labor. Nearly all quintuplet pregnancies result in a cesarean delivery. The average birth weight of a quintuplet is about 2 pounds, 12 ounces and most quintuplets receive medical care in a hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) until they reach their original birth date. Dionne Quintuplets Perhaps the most famous quintuplets are the Dionne Quintuplets born in Canada in 1934. They were the first surviving set of all identical quintuplets. The girls - Annette, Émilie, Yvonne, Cécile, and Marie - attracted worldwide attention. They were removed from their parent's care and placed in the custody of a doctor, who displayed them as a tourist attraction. Interesting Facts About Quintuplets The Wilkinson quintuplets weighed more than 21 pounds combined when they were born at about 34 weeks in 2007. The heaviest quintuplet births on record, according to the Guinness Book of World Records was 25 pounds combined, attributed to two mothers, Liu Saulian (China, 1953) and Mrs. Kamalammal (India, 1956).         Parents of quintuplets will change more than 35,000 diapers before their kids are potty trained. The first set of quintuplets born in the United States were reported to be the Kanouse quints in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1875. They were all boys and did not survive. The Fischer quintuplets were the first surviving quintuplets in the United States, born in 1963 in South Dakota, according to Wikipedia. Baseball player Melvin Mora is a dad of quintuplets born in 2001 (3 girls and 2 boys). The mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics are quintuplets. A 2004 television show, "Quintuplets" starred Andy Richter and Rebecca Creskoff as parents of teenage quints.  The 1994 novel, Feather Crowns , is about a young Kentucky farm couple who gives birth to quintuplets. Support Groups for Families Are you having quintuplets? It's important for families to seek support and advice from other families in the same situation. Here are some organizations that can offer resources and assistance: MOST (Mothers of Supertwins) (United States) Multiple Births Canada's Higher Order Multiples Support Network Australian Multiple Birth Association (AMBA) New Zealand Multiple Birth Association (NZMBA) Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba) (United Kingdom) Strollers for Quintuplets Five-seat quintuplet strollers are available and are a convenient -- though pricey -- option for transporting quints. The most prevalent brand is Runabout , a company that crafts multi-seat tandem strollers with hand-welded steel frames. They are quite expensive, costing nearly $1000 new from the manufacturer, but are widely available on the secondary market. Many families find it convenient to use a combination of double and triple strollers to accommodate all five babies.

Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

Identical Quadruplets Born: 1 in 13 Million   By ABC News  Aug. 22, 2007   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The chances of having quadruplets is about one in 800,000. The chances of having a set of identical quadruplets is one in 11 million to 15 million. On Aug. 12, four babies beat the odds and broke a record at the same time. The identical Jepp quadruplets were born in four quick minutes in Great Falls, Mont. The four identical baby girls — Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia — were delivered in the Benefis Healthcare System to proud parents Karen and J.P. "As any parent will tell you, bringing a new life into the world is an amazing wonderful thing, and we've got four amazing wonderful things," new dad J.P. said. The Jepps live in Calgary, Canada, but were sent to the states after learning that every single neonatal unit in Canada was too crowded to handle four premature births. One long hour after Karen Jepp went into labor and dozens of frantic phone calls later, the Jepps found Benefis Healthcare System in Montana — 300 miles away. They were on a plane shortly thereafter. "The nurses have been wonderful and really helped us out because we have no idea what we're doing," Karen said. The girls were delivered by Caesarean section after 31 weeks. All are in good health and breathing without ventilators. The girls were conceived without the help of fertility drugs; one egg split three times to produce four babies. With the babies traveling two to an incubator, the new family returned to Calgary in two separate trips; two with dad Thursday, and two with mom Friday. The birth of the Jepp girls marks one of fewer 50 sets of identical quadruplets in documented, medical history. "This is an incredibly rare event. You're talking about a one in 11 [million] to a one in 15 million event," said Jamie Grifo, division director of reproductive endocrinology at NYU Medical Center. Aside from J.P.'s mother, who is a twin, there is no history of multiple births in either parent's family. "My mom is a fraternal twin," J.P. said. "But we're told that doesn't apply in this case. Fraternal abilities may be genetic, but an egg splitting is just a genetic happening." The quads are expected to spend another four to eight weeks in the hospital before heading home with mom and dad to meet their big brother, 2-year-old Simon.        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

The Science of Identical Triplets and Quadruplets  By Laura Geggel, Senior Writer | October 28, 2015 09:49am ET                            MORE            Credit: A.G.A | Shutterstock.com     For two Baltimore parents, their three new bundles of joy may make them feel like one in a million, and statistics show they're not far off: Parents Thomas and Kristen Hewitt welcomed a rare set of identical triplets earlier this month, The Baltimore Sun reports.  The Hewitts' three boys were born more than six weeks early, on Oct. 6, the Sun reported . But having identical triplets is exceedingly rare, said Dr. Jonathan Herman, an OB-GYN at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, who was not involved in the triplets' care.  Statistics help tell the story: Without the help of fertility treatments, and according to a mathematical rule that doctors use called Hellin's law , about one in 90 births is twins, one in 8,100 births (90 squared) is triplets and one in 729,000 births (90 cubed) is quadruplets, Herman said. [ Seeing Double: 8 Fascinating Facts About Twins ]  However, these numbers include both identical and fraternal babies. Identical siblings are much more rare: Only about one in 250 births is identical twins, according to a 2003 study in the Journal of Biosocial Science . Identical triplets are even less common, occurring about 20 to 30 times per 1 million births, the study found.  During the past few decades, fertility treatments have led to a rise in the rate of twins and other multiple births. For instance, the twin birth rate in the United States has increased more than 75 percent since 1980, and the triplet and high-order multiple births increased at an even higher rate, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .  In 2013, there were about 132,300 twin births, about 4,300 triplet births , 270 quadruplet births, and 66 births of quintuplets or higher-order births, out of about 3.9 million total births in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .   How it happens  There are two main ways twin births occur. In the case of fraternal twins, a woman's ovaries release two eggs at the same time, which are then fertilized by two separate sperm. These babies develop at the same time within the womb, but the two children have the same degree of genetic similarity as any siblings, sharing about 50 percent of their genes.   Identical twins arise via a different route: A single sperm cell fertilizes a single egg, but then the single resulting cell splits into two identical cells, which have the same chromosomes. From this point on, the embryos may grow differently depending on their environments, but their DNA remains the same, Herman said.  In the case of identical triplets or quadruplets, the single fertilized egg splits into three or four genetically identical eggs, Herman said.  It's unknown why a fertilized egg sometimes splits, but identical twins tend to run in families, indicating that there's a genetic component, Herman said.  Researchers have also found some other hints: Studies show that older, as well as larger and taller women are more likely to have twins. The people of certain ethnic groups, including the Yoruba people of central Africa, are also more likely to have twins, whereas other groups, such as people in Asia and Central America, are less likely to have multiple births, a 2011 study in the journal PLOS ONE found.  But these numbers are only for surviving multiples; sometimes, the fetuses of multiple pregnancies don't survive to birth.  "The more babies you have [at once], the more dangerous it is," Herman told Live Science. "There's a saying that twins are twice as much fun for the family, but three times as much trouble for doctors."  Births involving twins, triplets and quadruplets often have complications, including prematurity and low birth weight, Herman said. In those with a condition called twin-twin transfusion, one fetus siphons blood from the other, and is born with ruddy skin, while the other is pale and scrawny, Herman said. Women who carry multiples also have a greater risk of gestational diabetes, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .  But the public continues to be fascinated with twins, and stories about identical triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets tend to make the news.  Such births also make a lot of work for parents. To tell their kids apart, the Hewitts have given each of their three boys differently colored strings to wear on their wrists and ankles, according to the Sun. And Kristen, a cosmetologist, plans to cut the boys' hair in different ways.  But her husband, Thomas, chuckled at the idea, according to the Sun, saying that it "will work, until they realize they can buzz each other's heads."   Follow Laura Geggel on Twitter @LauraGeggel .

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Multiple birth   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical Quadruplets Born: 1 in 13 Million   By ABC News  Aug. 22, 2007   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The chances of having quadruplets is about one in 800,000. The chances of having a set of identical quadruplets is one in 11 million to 15 million. On Aug. 12, four babies beat the odds and broke a record at the same time. The identical Jepp quadruplets were born in four quick minutes in Great Falls, Mont. The four identical baby girls — Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia — were delivered in the Benefis Healthcare System to proud parents Karen and J.P. "As any parent will tell you, bringing a new life into the world is an amazing wonderful thing, and we've got four amazing wonderful things," new dad J.P. said. The Jepps live in Calgary, Canada, but were sent to the states after learning that every single neonatal unit in Canada was too crowded to handle four premature births. One long hour after Karen Jepp went into labor and dozens of frantic phone calls later, the Jepps found Benefis Healthcare System in Montana — 300 miles away. They were on a plane shortly thereafter. "The nurses have been wonderful and really helped us out because we have no idea what we're doing," Karen said. The girls were delivered by Caesarean section after 31 weeks. All are in good health and breathing without ventilators. The girls were conceived without the help of fertility drugs; one egg split three times to produce four babies. With the babies traveling two to an incubator, the new family returned to Calgary in two separate trips; two with dad Thursday, and two with mom Friday. The birth of the Jepp girls marks one of fewer 50 sets of identical quadruplets in documented, medical history. "This is an incredibly rare event. You're talking about a one in 11 [million] to a one in 15 million event," said Jamie Grifo, division director of reproductive endocrinology at NYU Medical Center. Aside from J.P.'s mother, who is a twin, there is no history of multiple births in either parent's family. "My mom is a fraternal twin," J.P. said. "But we're told that doesn't apply in this case. Fraternal abilities may be genetic, but an egg splitting is just a genetic happening." The quads are expected to spend another four to eight weeks in the hospital before heading home with mom and dad to meet their big brother, 2-year-old Simon.        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

All are healthy, growing, active and doing well.     Courtesy Noelle Mirabella Photography    It’s the first time Jones has ever photographed quadruplets, so the project took much more planning and assistants than she was used to. Five extra people helped her set up the shoot: one person per baby and one person to help arrange the flowers and props. It took three large vehicles to haul all the items needed to the outdoor location in Grande Prairie.

Jones chose white outfits so that she could coordinate all of the different hats without having to change the babies and risk waking them up, she said.  Meanwhile, the tiny sisters are already confounding adults.  “With the exception of the smallest of the girls, Abigail, my assistants and I were not able to tell them apart with their outfits on. Prior to dressing them, we kept checking their hospital bracelets to see who was who,” Jones said.  To help tell them apart, the girls just had their ears pierced with different colored sets of earrings. Abby has blue, Emily has purple, Grace has red and Mckayla has pink, their mom said.

		Staff  The Canadian Press           WATCH ABOVE: An Alberta woman, pregnant with identical quadruplets, has recently given birth in Edmonton. On Monday, a couple from Hythe introduced their four new daughters to the world. Carole Anne Devaney reports.                             X               -   A  A   +       Listen            EDMONTON – An Alberta couple will have added reasons to celebrate when they mark their first wedding anniversary next month. Bethani and Tim Webb of Hythe — 500 kilometres northwest of Edmonton — became the parents of four identical baby girls on Friday. The naturally conceived quadruplets were delivered by caesarean section by obstetric and neonatal specialists at an Edmonton hospital.  Story continues below        “Of course, I’m worried about her,” Tim said. “The day of, everything went fine. “It was kind of like a magic show, because they’re pulling out one, two, three, four… It was kind of surreal.” The Webbs were told by a nurse during the pregnancy that the odds of having natural quads are one in 67 million.

It’s overwhelmingly awesome.” The girls have been named Emily, Grace, McKayla and Abigail and weigh between three pounds and four pounds, one ounce. How did the couple pick those names? “We just decided,” Bethani said simply. “Found some we liked and picked them out. It was nice that we didn’t have to pick our favourites. We could just pick four we liked. We didn’t have to choose just one.” “I’m looking forward to the memories,” Tim said, “and how close they’ll all be.” “I can’t wait until they’re home,” Bethani added. “It’s going to be crazy the first few years… It’ll be very exciting.” With files from Global News     Report an error        AHS  Alberta Health Services  Alberta quads  Edmonton Health Matters  Four babies  Hythe  Identical Quadruplets  Identical quads  Naturally conceived identical quads  naturally conceived quadruplets       Editor's Picks          Canada    How Ottawa might try to save the Trans Mountain pipeline          Tech    Two-thirds of Canadians don't trust Facebook with their data, Ipsos poll shows         Politics    UK probing AggregateIQ as part of inquiry into privacy law breach         Canada    Ambassador told to take down tweet about 'pleasing' Myanmar beach due to Canadian cold snap, not ethnic cleansing         Canada    Millennials are confident about buying homes, but many get a boost from mom and dad          Money    Donald Trump keeps attacking Amazon — here's why, and what he's hoping to accomplish          Politics    Bureaucrats working under Harper and Trudeau rejected IBM's advice to delay Phoenix         Canada    Matthew Schrier was kidnapped by al-Qaida in Syria.

The Science of Identical Triplets and Quadruplets  By Laura Geggel, Senior Writer | October 28, 2015 09:49am ET                            MORE            Credit: A.G.A | Shutterstock.com     For two Baltimore parents, their three new bundles of joy may make them feel like one in a million, and statistics show they're not far off: Parents Thomas and Kristen Hewitt welcomed a rare set of identical triplets earlier this month, The Baltimore Sun reports.  The Hewitts' three boys were born more than six weeks early, on Oct. 6, the Sun reported . But having identical triplets is exceedingly rare, said Dr. Jonathan Herman, an OB-GYN at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, who was not involved in the triplets' care.  Statistics help tell the story: Without the help of fertility treatments, and according to a mathematical rule that doctors use called Hellin's law , about one in 90 births is twins, one in 8,100 births (90 squared) is triplets and one in 729,000 births (90 cubed) is quadruplets, Herman said. [ Seeing Double: 8 Fascinating Facts About Twins ]  However, these numbers include both identical and fraternal babies. Identical siblings are much more rare: Only about one in 250 births is identical twins, according to a 2003 study in the Journal of Biosocial Science . Identical triplets are even less common, occurring about 20 to 30 times per 1 million births, the study found.  During the past few decades, fertility treatments have led to a rise in the rate of twins and other multiple births. For instance, the twin birth rate in the United States has increased more than 75 percent since 1980, and the triplet and high-order multiple births increased at an even higher rate, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .  In 2013, there were about 132,300 twin births, about 4,300 triplet births , 270 quadruplet births, and 66 births of quintuplets or higher-order births, out of about 3.9 million total births in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .   How it happens  There are two main ways twin births occur. In the case of fraternal twins, a woman's ovaries release two eggs at the same time, which are then fertilized by two separate sperm. These babies develop at the same time within the womb, but the two children have the same degree of genetic similarity as any siblings, sharing about 50 percent of their genes.   Identical twins arise via a different route: A single sperm cell fertilizes a single egg, but then the single resulting cell splits into two identical cells, which have the same chromosomes. From this point on, the embryos may grow differently depending on their environments, but their DNA remains the same, Herman said.  In the case of identical triplets or quadruplets, the single fertilized egg splits into three or four genetically identical eggs, Herman said.  It's unknown why a fertilized egg sometimes splits, but identical twins tend to run in families, indicating that there's a genetic component, Herman said.  Researchers have also found some other hints: Studies show that older, as well as larger and taller women are more likely to have twins. The people of certain ethnic groups, including the Yoruba people of central Africa, are also more likely to have twins, whereas other groups, such as people in Asia and Central America, are less likely to have multiple births, a 2011 study in the journal PLOS ONE found.  But these numbers are only for surviving multiples; sometimes, the fetuses of multiple pregnancies don't survive to birth.  "The more babies you have [at once], the more dangerous it is," Herman told Live Science. "There's a saying that twins are twice as much fun for the family, but three times as much trouble for doctors."  Births involving twins, triplets and quadruplets often have complications, including prematurity and low birth weight, Herman said. In those with a condition called twin-twin transfusion, one fetus siphons blood from the other, and is born with ruddy skin, while the other is pale and scrawny, Herman said. Women who carry multiples also have a greater risk of gestational diabetes, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .  But the public continues to be fascinated with twins, and stories about identical triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets tend to make the news.  Such births also make a lot of work for parents. To tell their kids apart, the Hewitts have given each of their three boys differently colored strings to wear on their wrists and ankles, according to the Sun. And Kristen, a cosmetologist, plans to cut the boys' hair in different ways.  But her husband, Thomas, chuckled at the idea, according to the Sun, saying that it "will work, until they realize they can buzz each other's heads."   Follow Laura Geggel on Twitter @LauraGeggel .

An individual that is part of such a set is called a quintuplet and sometimes referred to as a quint . Types of Quintuplets Quintuplets can be fraternal ( multi zygotic ), identical ( monozygotic ) or a combination of both. Multi zygotic quintuplets occur from five unique egg/sperm combinations. Monozygotic multiples are the result of a fertilized egg that splits into two or more embryos.         It is possible for a split to occur more than once, producing ​ monozygotic triplets or even a rare set of monozygotic quintuplets. Fully monozygotic quintuplets are rare, so rare that it is difficult to assess the odds. Quintuplets can be all male, all female, or a combination of both. (Monozygotic quintuplets will always be of the same gender.) Most quintuplets are a combination of boys and girls; all male or all female quintuples are rare. The first set of all-female quintuplets were born in the United States in 2015. In 2008, a Polish woman gave birth to a set of "probably identical" girls without the aid of fertility drugs. Odds of Quintuplets In 2005, the National Vital Statistics report for the United States reported the birth of 68 quintuplets and higher order multiples. Because this number includes the possible birth of sextuplets, septuplets or more, it is not determined exactly how many of those births were quintuplets.   The spontaneous conception of quintuplets is rare, the average estimate is 1 in about 60 million births. Most recent quintuplet births are the result of assisted reproductive techniques such as fertility enhancing drugs or in-vitro fertilization. Quintuplets do not always share the same birthdate. A delayed interval delivery (also known as iatrogenic asynchronous birth) may mean that individual babies are born days or even weeks apart.         Pregnancy With Quintuplets The average gestation for a quintuplet pregnancy is 29 weeks, as opposed to 40 weeks for a full-term baby. The longest gestation I've discovered was 35 weeks, a record held by the mother of the Stanford quintuplets in Rhode Island. Many mothers will gain more than fifty pounds during their pregnancy and will require cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is sewn shut to prevent preterm labor. Nearly all quintuplet pregnancies result in a cesarean delivery. The average birth weight of a quintuplet is about 2 pounds, 12 ounces and most quintuplets receive medical care in a hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) until they reach their original birth date. Dionne Quintuplets Perhaps the most famous quintuplets are the Dionne Quintuplets born in Canada in 1934. They were the first surviving set of all identical quintuplets. The girls - Annette, Émilie, Yvonne, Cécile, and Marie - attracted worldwide attention. They were removed from their parent's care and placed in the custody of a doctor, who displayed them as a tourist attraction. Interesting Facts About Quintuplets The Wilkinson quintuplets weighed more than 21 pounds combined when they were born at about 34 weeks in 2007. The heaviest quintuplet births on record, according to the Guinness Book of World Records was 25 pounds combined, attributed to two mothers, Liu Saulian (China, 1953) and Mrs. Kamalammal (India, 1956).         Parents of quintuplets will change more than 35,000 diapers before their kids are potty trained. The first set of quintuplets born in the United States were reported to be the Kanouse quints in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1875. They were all boys and did not survive. The Fischer quintuplets were the first surviving quintuplets in the United States, born in 1963 in South Dakota, according to Wikipedia. Baseball player Melvin Mora is a dad of quintuplets born in 2001 (3 girls and 2 boys). The mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics are quintuplets. A 2004 television show, "Quintuplets" starred Andy Richter and Rebecca Creskoff as parents of teenage quints.  The 1994 novel, Feather Crowns , is about a young Kentucky farm couple who gives birth to quintuplets. Support Groups for Families Are you having quintuplets? It's important for families to seek support and advice from other families in the same situation. Here are some organizations that can offer resources and assistance: MOST (Mothers of Supertwins) (United States) Multiple Births Canada's Higher Order Multiples Support Network Australian Multiple Birth Association (AMBA) New Zealand Multiple Birth Association (NZMBA) Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba) (United Kingdom) Strollers for Quintuplets Five-seat quintuplet strollers are available and are a convenient -- though pricey -- option for transporting quints. The most prevalent brand is Runabout , a company that crafts multi-seat tandem strollers with hand-welded steel frames. They are quite expensive, costing nearly $1000 new from the manufacturer, but are widely available on the secondary market. Many families find it convenient to use a combination of double and triple strollers to accommodate all five babies.

Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?
