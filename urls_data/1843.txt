Undo Answer Wiki 17 Answers   Abhijeet Patil , Student Updated Feb 1, 2016 Definition of probability says the probability of certain event is ratio of number of desired outcomes of an experience to the number of possible outcomes of that experiment (if they are equiprobable). In this case, possible outcomes of an experiment are, [math]S = \{ A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z \}[/math] Therefore, number of possible outcomes is number of elements in S (also called as cardinality of S and denoted by [math]\mid S \mid[/math] ). In our case, [math]\\  \mid  S \mid = 26[/math] And desired outcomes are, [math] \begin{align} A &= \{  A,E,I,O,U  \} \\ \textrm{And} \mid A \mid &= 5 \end{align}[/math] .

Ask New Question   Medikonda Pavan , studies Masters of Management at Shailesh J Mehta School Of Management, IIT Bombay (2019) Answered Apr 9, 2018 It depends on the alphabets and its structure! Let’s consider English Alphabet for simplicity. We have 26 letters, having 5 vowels and 21 consonants. So the possibilities of choosing vowel are 5, whereas total possibilities(choosing any random letter) would be 26. Hence, the probability of choosing a vowel from English Alphabet is 5/26 27 Views · Answer requested by  Hanspreet Kaur   Charles Gaskell , Own several dictionaries in several different languages Answered Jan 3, 2018 It depends on the alphabet you are talking about (yes, there are several in existence beyond the Roman Alphabet used for English), what exactly you count as a vowel (the "y" in "rhythm" is definitely a vowel in this context and in some circumstances "w" can be so also) and whether you count accented vowels and other variants as separate letters or not - there are quite a few languages where some modified versions of Roman Alphabet letters have their own section in the dictionary, rather than being mixed in with the unmodified version. But in general, the probability for each language and associated alphabet is determined by dividing the number of letters that you consider to be a vowel by the total number of letters you consider to be in the alphabet. For English, it's roughly 5 in 26. (OMMV) 1.7k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

You need a corpus of text. It usually gathers text from passages, chapters, or sections of a book. And you usually gather books in a genre, from a period, from certain authors, or a style of prose. Then you can put them into text. You may take from all volumes, separate on the book, or another dividing line. Then you collect the characters, i.e. vowels or consonants from the text, and remove any additional characters, i.e. symbols, punctuation, and then find the frequency. You find the frequency of vowels among vowels or consonants, or how you restrict letters. If you have both the frequency of vowels and the frequency of letters, then you can calculate the probability of vowels.

Those are just letters though. There are actually 24 or more vowel sounds in typical English dialects. There is one letter i but it represents a number of sounds (as in “ill, fight, I, pencil, etc.”) as well as in combination (as in “fiend, friend”). Do you want to consider the semi-vowel “i”-ish sound in words like “few, you, etc.”? The most frequent vowel sound in English is schwa: [ə]. But you will not even find it in the alphabet to compete against the letter i! So … Are you seeking probability for the letter i or the sound an i represents—and if so, which sound? Are you seeking probability for i in a nominal sense—if so, are you looking at a list of letters or a list of the sounds that i can represent—in which case you need to decide on a dialect. And are you wanting to measure probability in a corpus or spoken data, written data, etc.—and if so, which corpus? It would be so tempting to say your odds of hitting an i are 1 in 5 (or 6, or 7) but that would take all the fun out of the Pandora’s research box that you would surely want to open! And one of the fun questions to ask about research is “so what?” If you define your parameters and establish a probability for i, so what? How does that advance theory, understanding, prediction, etc.? Of course, you can always make a video! 148 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

So total no.of cases are 26 as there are total 26 alphabets The probability of choosing a vowel from English alphabets is 5/26 Probability=5/26 Hope this answers your question 331 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Answered Nov 27, 2016 · Author has 171 answers and 206.5k answer views In the word “PROBABILITY” Total number of letters =11 Number of vowels (o, a, i, i) = 4 Thus, the required probability = 4/11 Note: Here, first we select a letter from the given word and after that we observe if it is a vowel or not. The letter ‘Y’ might produce the sound of a long E when we pronounce the word PROBABILITY, but when we select it out of the 11 letters and observe, we will not say it is ‘E’, it would just be a consonant. So, letter ‘Y’ would not be considered as a vowel in this case, and the answer would be FOUR out of eleven (not 5 out of eleven). 8.9k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Shreya Reddy Related Questions More Answers Below A letter is chosen at random from the word extraterrestrial.

Undo   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Updated Feb 9, 2018 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views If we take "at random" to mean uniformly at random (which is the typical interpretation when there is no other information given) then the answer is actually FIVE out of eleven (not 4 out of eleven as the other answers give). In English, the letter Y is considered a vowel when it makes the sound of a long E as it does in the word PROBABILITY.  So the vowels are the A, the two I's, the O, and the Y -- a total of five of the eleven letters. The only thing I have to add is that while "at random" is usually taken to mean uniformly at random, it need not mean this.  For example, we could assign the probabilities in such a way that each letter is twice as likely as the letter before it.  So "p" would have probability 1/2047 of being selected, "r" would have probability 2/2047, "o" would have probability 4/2047, and so on.  Finally "y" would have probability 1024/2047.  In this case, we'd add the probabilities of the five vowels to get a total probability of 1346/2047. 11.7k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Radhika Amashi   Chandra Shekhar , Numbers never lie!

  that he will get all vowels?   My approach,  The number of ways to the letters of the words "MATHEMATICS" can be arranged 3 at a time is coefficient of $x^3 $ $$ 3! \times  (1+x)^5 \times \left(1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}\right)^3$$ which is $399$  The number of arrangements of 2A's, 1I and 1E taken 3 at at a time is coefficient of $x^3$ in  $$ 3! \times  (1+x)^2 \times  \left(1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}\right)$$ which is $12$.  Then the required probability is given by $\frac {12}{399} $ but apparently this is not the right answer.

If it were MATHEMOTICS, how would it be different? – Gerry Myerson  Mar 4 '12 at 8:32            Why do repetitions matter? You have one tile for each letter, so you have 11 tiles. Of these 11 tiles, 4 tiles contain vowels. If you grab 3 tiles, what are the odds that all 3 tiles are vowels? Where the letters come from, or what the letters are, is irrelevant; the problem works exactly the same way if four tiles have an A in them and seven tiles have a B; or if four tiles are A, E, I, O, and the other seven are B, C, D, F, G, H, J. You are not being asked for the possible number of 3-letter sequences that can be made from the letters in "MATHEMATICS" (where repetitions would matter). – Arturo Magidin  Mar 4 '12 at 8:32             Foool: You are confusing this question with the question "What are the different possibilities of picking three vowels?". In this case the repetitions would matter. – fretty  Mar 4 '12 at 9:12         add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Once you draw the first letter there will be three letters left and so there will by $3$ choices  to draw the second letter.  That means there are $4*3 = 12$ ways to draw two letters.  If you don't trust that, you can count them out.  The first letter can $M,A,T,E$.  If it's $M$ the second letter can be $A,T,$ or $E$. and you could draw $MA, MT$ or $ME$.  $3$ ways.  If the first letter is $A$ the second letter $M,T,$ or $E$.  $AM, AT,AE$.  $3$ more ways.  Then $TM, TA$ or $TE$.  $3$ more.  And finally $EM, EA,ET$.  $12$ ways total.  Now in order to draw two vowels there are $2$ choices for the first vowel: $A$ or $E$.  And for the second vowel there will only be one vowel left to be the second one.  So there are $2*1 =2$ ways to draw two vowels.  Namely:  $A$ then $E$.  And $E$ than $A$.  So of the $12$ total ways to draw two letters, there are $2$ ways to draw to vowels.  So the probability is  $\frac 2{12} = \frac 16$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 2 '17 at 5:48       fleablood   52k 2 22 65                  Thanks so much! – Minimoocha  Sep 3 '17 at 10:20        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      There are six ways to choose two letters from the word:  MAte MaTe MatE

Two of them are vowels so there is a 2/4 chance that the first pick will be a vowel.

Not sure if that's the way you guys do it, but that's the way my book teaches me.  The probability of the letter being in the word "house" is 5/26  The probability of the letter being in the word "phone" is 5/26 also.  The probability of the letter being in both "phone" and "house" is 3/26, since there are 3 letters, being o, u, and h.  So, (5/26) + (5/26) - (3/26) is equal to 7/26. That's my answer. Please correct me if I'm wrong!  Thanks for the help guys.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 10 '16 at 3:17       Justin   51 1 6                  Your answer is correct. – N.

To explain your question in terms of this concept, we could let the events   $A =$ letter chosen is part of "house"  $B =$ letter chosen is part of "phone"   Then the events $A$ and $B$ are not mutually exclusive, because both events could simultaneously happen (ie. if the letter chosen is an o, h or e).  So, to calculate the probability of $A$ OR $B$ happening, use: $P(A \text{ or } B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \text{ and } B)$, where $P(A \text{ and } B)$ is the probability of both $A$ and $B$ happening. If you don't already know this formula, you should look it up and understand why it is true.  $P(A)=5/26$ since there are $5$ distinct letters in "house" and $26$ possible letters to chose from. Similarly, $P(B)=5/26$.  $A$ and $B$ both happen iff the letter chosen is in both words - ie. the letter is o, h or e. So, $P(A \text{ and } B)=3/26$.  So $P(A \text{ or } B)=5/26 + 5/26 - 3/26 = 7/26$.  That answer can also be arrived at by considering the number of possible ways to get a letter that is in one or both of the words.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 10 '16 at 3:19       Esmath   403 4 14                  This is exactly the way I did it, thanks for confirming it! – Justin  May 10 '16 at 3:20            You're very welcome! – Esmath  May 10 '16 at 3:21        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      If you're not too comfortable yet with these probability problems, each time you work one you might want to back up and think about what the exact model for the problem is.  In this case:  Experiment: Pick one letter from the alphabet at random.  Sample space: There are 26 possible outcomes.  $S = \{a, b, c, \ldots, z\}$.  Probability distribution: The problem is implicitly assuming all choices are equally likely here, so we have $P(\{\text{letter}\}) = 1/26$ for every letter.  Event: The letter you've chosen is contained in the word "house" or "phone."  So $E = \{x \in S \mid x \text{ is one of } h, o, u, s, e, p, n \}$.  That is, $E$ is just the set $\{h, o, u, s, e, p, n\}$.  (You can break this down into a union of two separate events, as other answers are suggesting, also.)  The problem wants to know $P(E)$, which equals $P(\{h\}) + P(\{o\}) + \cdots + P(\{n\})$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 10 '16 at 3:22       DJX   410 3 13                  Thanks for the quick tips! – Justin  May 10 '16 at 3:25        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Let  $A$ = event that letter is in "house"  $\mathrm{P}(A) = \frac{5}{26}$  $B$ = event that letter is in "phone"  $\mathrm{P}(B) = \frac{5}{26}$  $A\cap B^c$ = the letter is in house but not phone

In short, find the probability that the letter is one from "e", "h", "n", "o", "p", "s" or "u".   I know this problem has something to do with mutually inclusive??   Indeed it has something to do with that.   They are not mutually exclusive events; so the probability of the union is the sum of the probabilities of the events minus the probability of the intersection.  $$\Bbb P(X\in \text{"house"$\cup$"phone"}) \\=\\ \Bbb P(X\in \text{"house"})+\Bbb P(X\in \text{"phone"})-\Bbb P(X\in \text{"house"$\cap$"phone"})$$  There are five letters in the word "house", five letters in the word "phone", and three letters that are common to both words.

What is the likelihood of it happening 3 turns in a row?  Some assumptions are necessary. Let’s use these:   Two-player game  English tile distribution  Vowels are AEIOU (ie, exclude Y)  The situation is drawing all vowels on the first pull, followed by being in that situation on the subsequent two turns.  The subject draws first.  The opponent plays first (this probably contradicts the game rules but is convenient for this experiment).  The opponent plays a four-letter word on every turn, and that word is two consonants and two vowels.  The subject is able to play two of their vowels on each turn, requiring a draw of two new tiles.   (If any of the above assumptions is logically impossible, please correct.)  An interesting bit is that blanks can be counted as either a consonant or vowel.  Distribution of English words and letter usage is disregarded for this calculation. Though if you want to throw it in for extra interest, great.    probability  recreational-mathematics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Aug 6 '12 at 2:07       mixedmath ♦   71.1k 6 107 235        asked Aug 4 '12 at 4:11       Matt Sherman ♦   131 3              1      In general I think all-vowel hands come up because we don't use our vowels as quickly as we use our consonants.  I think it's very rare that anyone actually draws a all-vowel hand on the first turn.  But if you tend to play 2 consonants to every vowel it won't take long before you reach an all-vowel hand (Typical since it's easy to play off your opponents vowels).  Furthermore every time you draw a consonant thereafter, your temptation is to play it instantly so you get stuck in this position.  Most of my friends rarely (if ever) use the exchange option.  I use it more than anyone else I know. – dspyz  Aug 4 '12 at 5:19             I'm not too happy about the second-to-last assumption. It changes the question from "What are the chances of three consecutive hands of all vowels?" to "What are the chances... given that the opponent receives at least two consonants and two vowels on their first turn, and at least four each over two turns?" Michael Lugo's answer is quite elegant, but it only works without this assumption. – Rahul  Aug 4 '12 at 6:02            +1 for taking a real world problem and making it specific enough to have an answer. – Ross Millikan  Aug 4 '12 at 17:39        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote      The identity of the letters doesn't matter, so let's just note that there are 42 vowels, 56 consonants, and 2 blanks.  Imagine that the game starts by putting these tiles in random order, 1 through 100.  The subject draws tiles 1 through 7, and the opponent draws tiles 8 through 14.  The opponent then plays four tiles and draws tiles 15 through 18; the subject plays two tiles and draws tiles 19 and 20.  This repeats, with the opponent drawing tiles 21 through 24, and the subject drawing tiles 25 and 26.  So under your assumptions, you're asking for the probability that positions 1 through 7, 19, 20, 25, and 26 are all among the vowels.  (Blanks don't count as vowels here; if I had six vowels and a blank I don't think I'd say "I have all vowels", although I might be unhappy with my hand.)  This is the probability that, if I draw eleven tiles at random, they will all be vowels.  There are ${100 \choose 11}$ ways to choose eleven tiles; of these ${42 \choose 11}$ consist entirely of vowels. So the answer is ${42 \choose 11}/{100 \choose 11}$ which is about $3 \times 10^{-5}$.  Note that your assumptions on how many tiles the opponent is going to play don't matter at all, but your assumptions on how many tiles the subject is able to play matter quite a bit.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 4 '12 at 4:58       Michael Lugo   17.1k 3 32 73                  Actually, knowing that 8 of the opponents tiles are 4 vowels and 4 consonants reduce the set you're drawing from to 38 vowels and 52 consonants, so knowing what letters your opponent plays matters a little bit. – dspyz  Aug 4 '12 at 5:15            Good point.  So we should have ${38 \choose 11}/{92 \choose 11} \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-5}$. – Michael Lugo  Aug 4 '12 at 14:28            My answer is slightly different, as I didn't consider that you know the opponent's first play when drawing the first rack or the second play when drawing the next two.  It doesn't change much. – Ross Millikan  Aug 4 '12 at 17:53        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      The tiles are 42 vowels and 58 consonants (counting blanks as consonants, which you would if vower-rich).  The chance drawing seven vowels is $\frac {42!93!}{35!100!}\approx 0.001685$
The next turn you need to draw 2 vowels from a set of 33 vowels and 56 consonants, for a chance of $\frac {33\cdot 32}{89\cdot 88}\approx 0.1348$.  The third turn you need to draw 2 vowels from a set of 29 vowels and 54 consonants, for a chance of $\frac {29\cdot 28}{83\cdot 82}\approx 0.1193$.  The total is then  $\frac {42!93!\cdot 33 \cdot 32 \cdot 29 \cdot 28}{35!100!\cdot 89 \cdot 88 \cdot 83 \cdot 82}\approx 0.00002711$ or about $1$ in $36886$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 4 '12 at 17:51       Ross Millikan   262k 21 175 328              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Therefore the probability is 5/26 - or 0.192307692. This assumes, of course, that you are randomly picking a letter from the alphabet... or rather, that each letter occurs in equal proportion within a larger text. This assumes the English alphabet. In other alphabets from other languages, there may be a different quantity of vowels and a different quantity of consonants (or possibly other letters all together). In writing, however, it is not the case that each letter appears in equal proportion. In a typical written document, for example, vowels make up about 38% of a text, on average. But it depends on a particular text, too, it may vary a little. Of course, it matters which language you draw a text from. Those languages which use the exact same alphabet as in English dont necessarily have the same distribution of vowels in text.   2 people  found this useful                       Tiggerfan  104 Contributions      How does an ipod pick a random song?

Suppose we have a completely shuffled standard deck of cards. It includes 52 cards, 13 from each figure. If we pick a card at random, we have a chance of 13/52 = 1/4 of picking a heart. Therefore, the probability of picking a heart at random is 0.25.

The probability that all will be graduates will be 5/20 x 4/19 x 3/18. This equals 0.0087719, or 0.877% The probability of at least one being a graduate is 1 minus the probability of none being graduates. That's 1-(15/20 x 14/19 x 13/18)   = 1 - 0.39912280701754385964912280701754   = 0.600877   =60%  Thus the probability of having at least one graduate is 60%               Robert  Siekman  247,569 Contributions  Engineer and college professor. Work with the American Red Cross as an instructor and instructor trainer.      A card is picked at random from a standard deck What is the probability of a drawing card that is a red Ace?  Probability is the number of ways an event can occur divided by the number of total events. The number of ways a red ace can occur is 2 (ace of hearts, diamonds) and total number of events is 52 (standard deck has 52 cards). So the probability is 2/52 or 1/26.

Asimas  1 Contribution      What is probability of getting a vowel if a letter is chosen at random from the word Statistician?  Q. A letter is chosen at random from the word STATistician.       . 
What is the probability that it is a vowel?  . 
What is the probability that it is T.               Pl224  5 Contributions      One letter is chosen at random from the word isosceles what is the probability of choosing?  It's not specified what exactly you want to find the probability of, but as a general rule:   The word "isosceles" has nine letters, so your denominator will be nine because that is the number of possible choices.    To find the numerator, determine how many letters meet the criteria or criterion you want to satisfy. For example:   If you want to find the probability of choosing the letter s: there are three "s"s in the word "isosceles," so your numerator would be three, giving you a fraction of 3/9, which reduces to 1/3.   If you want to find the probability of choosing a vowel: there are four vowels (i, o, e, e), so your probability would be 4/9.   The same principle applies regardless of how the question ends (the probability of choosing ____). Remember that if you want your answer as a percent, you can simply divide the fraction and multiply by 100%.               CFirg  49,612 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter chosen at random from the 26 letters in the alphabet would be in the word mathematics?  There are eight different letters in 'mathematics' - a, c, e, h, i, m, s and t.  Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, the chance of a randomly chosen one being a letter that's in mathematics is 8/26, or 4/13.            There are 52 cards in a deck of playing cards and each deck has four sixes If you pick one card from the deck at random what is the probability that you will pick six?  4/52 = 1/13  There are 4 sixes (the numerator) There are 52 cards (denominator) Reduce your fraction  You have 4 chances out of 52 that the card you pick will be a six (because there are 4 sixes in the 52-card deck)               G26443jh92fhb5  6,901 Contributions      A jar contains 8 red marbles 9 blue marbles and 6 green marbles Two marbles are picked at random What is the probability that one is green and one is blue?  Without replacement:   P(one green and one blue) = P(drawing green then blue) + P(drawing blue then green)   = (6/23)(9/22) + (9/23)(6/22) = 104/506 = 52/253    With replacement:   P(one green and one blue) = P(green)*P(blue) = (6/23)(9/23) = 54/529               Superscot85  6,977 Contributions      Suppose one in every four cars is black and black SUVs amount to one tenth of all cars What is the probability that a black car picked at random is an SUV?  Suppose there are only 20 cars in the world: 5 will be black and 2 will be black SUVs, so if you pick a black car at random there are 2 chances out of 5 that it will be an SUV, ie probability of 0.4 or 40%               Stacey Goulet  17 Contributions      A bag contains 3 blue marbles 7 red marbles and 5 yellow marbles If Joe picks 1 marble from the bag at random what is the probability that it will be blue?  1 in 15 chances that the marble will be blue, because there are 15 marbles all together in a bag, and you are only picking one out of it.               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability that a random person has a birthday in July?  A simple answer is 1/12 = 0.0833... since there are 12 months in a year, of which 1 has been selected.  A slightly better estimate, allowing for the the fact that July has 31 days is 31/365 = 0.0849. Adjusting for leap years does not affect the probability at 4 decimal places.  These answers assume that births are uniformly distributed over the year. In fact they are not but comprehensive information on births by month is not readily available.               LimeAid  94,009 Contributions      What is the probability of choosing at random a vowel from the word puzzle?  "Puzzle" has 6 letters, and 2 of them are vowels. So the odds of choosing a vowel are 2/6, which equals 1/3, which is one-third or 33.33%.               Jamesgrant  1,136 Contributions      What is the probability of a vowel being picked at randoms from the word probability?  The word 'probability' has 11 letters and 5 of them are vowels (including the 'y'). Therefore the probability of picking a vowel is 5/11.               Scoopsfolks  289 Contributions      In a word aspiration what is the probability for selecting one letter as vowel?  There are 10 letters in the word "aspiration" and 5 of them are vowels. The probability of a randomly-selected letter being a vowel are 5/10 = 1/2 = 0.50.            Is the y in probably a vowel?  Yes. The y in probably is used as a vowel. The y in yes is a consonant.               XTheRockFanX  11 Contributions      What is the probability of picking a card with a vowel on it from a box of cards in which each letter of alphabet is written on a card?  Think, if there are A, E, I, O, U, and couting Y, there are 6 vowels. there are 26 letters. So the answer is 6 over 26 and then you simplify it to 3 over 13.               Phelikx  1,925 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter picked at random is not a vowel?  To work out probability you have to know the number of possible options, and how many of those options meet the criteria. In this case there are 26 possible options (all the letters) and 21 that meet the criteria (21 non-vowels). The probability is the number that match divided by the total number possible. In this case it would be 21/26. This comes out to approximately 0.80769. Thus the probability that a letter picked at random is not a vowel is 0.80769               Al Cohen  126,337 Contributions  Senior Fellow in Electrical Engineering      What is the probability that you pick an odd number at random from 75 to 100?  From 75 to 100 (inclusive), there are 26 numbers, and 13 of them are odd.    The probability of picking an odd number is 13/26 =  50%  .               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability that the vowel is before j?  The answer depends on what language you refer to. It also depends on which particular vowel is being referred to as " the  vowel".  Then you would need to know the number of words in that language that contained a j as well as those that contained a j after  the  vowel. The second number divided by the fist would give the required probability.               Alex146  49,465 Contributions      What is the probability that a month picked at random ends with the letter y?  There are 4 months that end in the letter Y, January, February, May, and July. The probability, then, of a random month ending in the letter Y is 4 in 12, or 1 in 3, or about 0.3333.               Chuck Goodman  31,106 Contributions      What is the probability of picking 2 hearts at random from a deck of playing cards?  Chance of picking first heart card is 13/52, picking second right after is 12/51, total chance is 13/52 multiplied by 12/51. This works if we pick one card, don't replace it and then pick another. Here is the probability of 2 Hearts if we pick two cards at the same time. 13 Hearts choose 2/ 52 cards choose 2= 13C2/52C2=78/1326=1/17               Alex146  49,465 Contributions      What is the probability that A date picked at random is February 30?  The probability that a date picked at random is February 30th is zero, as there is no February 30th, even in leap years.               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      Are probability and random sampling anonymous?  Probability is a branch of mathematics and so is not linked with any individual and so is anonymous. Random sampling may or may not include information that will allow the contributor to be identified. So it may or may not be anonymous.               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability that a random card picked up from a deck is a 10 or a spade?  There are 4 tens and 13 spades but one of these is the ten of spades.  So there are 4 + 13 - 1 = 16 cards which lead to "success". Therefore the probability is 16/52 = 4/13               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability of picking a card?

Christopher Burke  86 Contributions      What is the probability of picking white?  The probability of picking white is equal to the number of white objects divided by the total number of objects (both white and non-white), assuming that all of the objects are identical other than color.    In Geometry, the probability of landing on a white space is the area of the white space divided by the total area.               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability of picking a card with a number on it?  It is 9/13.  However, in some decks, the tens are labelled as T and then theprobability would be 8/13.               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      How do you solve probability problems with random numbers?  There are occasions where the probability distribution function(pdf) has to be obtained empirically (experimentally). However, itis possible that it is expensive (in time or money) to carry outrepeated experiments. In such a case, it can be useful to build amathematical model that simulates the trial. Input random numbersand the model outputs the result of the trial. In this way it iseasier to carry out repeated trials and so generate the requiredpdf.               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability that you draw a two or four when you pick a card at random from a pack of playing cards?  Form a normal pack of 52 cards (no Jokers), it is 2/13 or approx 0.154            What is the probability of picking a consonant?  Out of the alphabet, the probability would be 21/26. Remember that consonants are anything except the letters A, E, I, O, and U. Hope that this answers your question!            Is the word Pick a vowel or consonant?  Vowels and consonants are letters, not words. In the word "pick",the letter "i" is a vowel and the other three letters areconsonants.

Ask New Question   Medikonda Pavan , studies Masters of Management at Shailesh J Mehta School Of Management, IIT Bombay (2019) Answered Apr 9, 2018 It depends on the alphabets and its structure! Let’s consider English Alphabet for simplicity. We have 26 letters, having 5 vowels and 21 consonants. So the possibilities of choosing vowel are 5, whereas total possibilities(choosing any random letter) would be 26. Hence, the probability of choosing a vowel from English Alphabet is 5/26 27 Views · Answer requested by  Hanspreet Kaur   Charles Gaskell , Own several dictionaries in several different languages Answered Jan 3, 2018 It depends on the alphabet you are talking about (yes, there are several in existence beyond the Roman Alphabet used for English), what exactly you count as a vowel (the "y" in "rhythm" is definitely a vowel in this context and in some circumstances "w" can be so also) and whether you count accented vowels and other variants as separate letters or not - there are quite a few languages where some modified versions of Roman Alphabet letters have their own section in the dictionary, rather than being mixed in with the unmodified version. But in general, the probability for each language and associated alphabet is determined by dividing the number of letters that you consider to be a vowel by the total number of letters you consider to be in the alphabet. For English, it's roughly 5 in 26. (OMMV) 1.7k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

The probability of selecting a vowel from the English alphabet is 5/26 (≈19.2%) if you include only A, E, I, O, and U as vowels. If you include Y as a vowel, the probability is 6/26 (≈23.1%). 84 Views · View Upvoters   Manjunath Subramanya Iyer , I am a retired bank officer teaching maths Answered Feb 19, 2018 · Author has 1.5k answers and 75.5k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of choosing a vowel from the alphabet? You mean English alphabet. A letter can be randomly selected from 26 English alphabets in 26 ways.So if S is the sample space containing all outcomes then n(S) = 26. Now there are 5 vowels. If we want the desired event E as selecting a vowel then n(E) = 5. Therefore the probability of choosing a vowel from the English alphabet = n(E)/n(S) = 5/26 316 Views   Tweet Laha , Know up to Grade 10 Maths; love the subject.

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers   David Minger , BA, MA Linguistics, PhD Education, love science Answered Mar 30, 2018 · Author has 1.4k answers and 993.3k answer views Kids are told there are five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and sometimes y—so six total. Those are just letters though. There are actually 24 or more vowel sounds in typical English dialects. There is one letter i but it represents a number of sounds (as in “ill, fight, I, pencil, etc.”) as well as in combination (as in “fiend, friend”). Do you want to consider the semi-vowel “i”-ish sound in words like “few, you, etc.”? The most frequent vowel sound in English is schwa: [ə]. But you will not even find it in the alphabet to compete against the letter i! So … Are you seeking probability for the letter i or the sound an i represents—and if so, which sound? Are you seeking probability for i in a nominal sense—if so, are you looking at a list of letters or a list of the sounds that i can represent—in which case you need to decide on a dialect. And are you wanting to measure probability in a corpus or spoken data, written data, etc.—and if so, which corpus? It would be so tempting to say your odds of hitting an i are 1 in 5 (or 6, or 7) but that would take all the fun out of the Pandora’s research box that you would surely want to open! And one of the fun questions to ask about research is “so what?” If you define your parameters and establish a probability for i, so what? How does that advance theory, understanding, prediction, etc.? Of course, you can always make a video! 148 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Answered Nov 27, 2016 · Author has 171 answers and 206.5k answer views In the word “PROBABILITY” Total number of letters =11 Number of vowels (o, a, i, i) = 4 Thus, the required probability = 4/11 Note: Here, first we select a letter from the given word and after that we observe if it is a vowel or not. The letter ‘Y’ might produce the sound of a long E when we pronounce the word PROBABILITY, but when we select it out of the 11 letters and observe, we will not say it is ‘E’, it would just be a consonant. So, letter ‘Y’ would not be considered as a vowel in this case, and the answer would be FOUR out of eleven (not 5 out of eleven). 8.9k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Shreya Reddy Related Questions More Answers Below A letter is chosen at random from the word extraterrestrial.

Undo   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Updated Feb 9, 2018 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views If we take "at random" to mean uniformly at random (which is the typical interpretation when there is no other information given) then the answer is actually FIVE out of eleven (not 4 out of eleven as the other answers give). In English, the letter Y is considered a vowel when it makes the sound of a long E as it does in the word PROBABILITY.  So the vowels are the A, the two I's, the O, and the Y -- a total of five of the eleven letters. The only thing I have to add is that while "at random" is usually taken to mean uniformly at random, it need not mean this.  For example, we could assign the probabilities in such a way that each letter is twice as likely as the letter before it.  So "p" would have probability 1/2047 of being selected, "r" would have probability 2/2047, "o" would have probability 4/2047, and so on.  Finally "y" would have probability 1024/2047.  In this case, we'd add the probabilities of the five vowels to get a total probability of 1346/2047. 11.7k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Radhika Amashi   Chandra Shekhar , Numbers never lie!

  bag. Foool picks three without replacement. what is the probability
  that he will get all vowels?   My approach,  The number of ways to the letters of the words "MATHEMATICS" can be arranged 3 at a time is coefficient of $x^3 $ $$ 3! \times  (1+x)^5 \times \left(1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}\right)^3$$ which is $399$  The number of arrangements of 2A's, 1I and 1E taken 3 at at a time is coefficient of $x^3$ in  $$ 3! \times  (1+x)^2 \times  \left(1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}\right)$$ which is $12$.  Then the required probability is given by $\frac {12}{399} $ but apparently this is not the right answer. What exactly I am missing here?    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Mar 4 '12 at 8:34       Arturo Magidin   248k 30 550 871        asked Mar 4 '12 at 8:22       Quixotic   11.3k 18 74 163              add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  7  down vote  accepted      How many ways are there to pick 3 letters? How many ways are there to pick 3 vowels? By my count, the right answer should be $$\binom{4}{3}/\binom{11}{3}=\frac{4}{165}.$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 4 '12 at 8:29       Arturo Magidin   248k 30 550 871                  Thanks Arturo, I just over-complicated a simple problem :( – Quixotic  Mar 4 '12 at 8:36        1      You have four items: four physical tiles; they are different objects, because they are different tiles . Just because two of them have the same letter written on them does not make them the same tile! – Arturo Magidin  Mar 4 '12 at 8:40             Thanks again Arturo, I was all messed up. – Quixotic  Mar 4 '12 at 8:42        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I don't know what you're missing, because I don't know why you're taking the approach you take. The answer is $(4/11)(3/10)(2/9)$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 4 '12 at 8:26       Gerry Myerson   140k 7 140 285                  But there is repetition of letters, so why would this work? – Quixotic  Mar 4 '12 at 8:30         1      What difference does repetition make? If it were MATHEMOTICS, how would it be different? – Gerry Myerson  Mar 4 '12 at 8:32            Why do repetitions matter? You have one tile for each letter, so you have 11 tiles. Of these 11 tiles, 4 tiles contain vowels. If you grab 3 tiles, what are the odds that all 3 tiles are vowels? Where the letters come from, or what the letters are, is irrelevant; the problem works exactly the same way if four tiles have an A in them and seven tiles have a B; or if four tiles are A, E, I, O, and the other seven are B, C, D, F, G, H, J. You are not being asked for the possible number of 3-letter sequences that can be made from the letters in "MATHEMATICS" (where repetitions would matter). – Arturo Magidin  Mar 4 '12 at 8:32             Foool: You are confusing this question with the question "What are the different possibilities of picking three vowels?".

Once you draw the first letter there will be three letters left and so there will by $3$ choices  to draw the second letter.  That means there are $4*3 = 12$ ways to draw two letters.  If you don't trust that, you can count them out.  The first letter can $M,A,T,E$.  If it's $M$ the second letter can be $A,T,$ or $E$. and you could draw $MA, MT$ or $ME$.  $3$ ways.  If the first letter is $A$ the second letter $M,T,$ or $E$.  $AM, AT,AE$.  $3$ more ways.  Then $TM, TA$ or $TE$.  $3$ more.  And finally $EM, EA,ET$.  $12$ ways total.  Now in order to draw two vowels there are $2$ choices for the first vowel: $A$ or $E$.  And for the second vowel there will only be one vowel left to be the second one.  So there are $2*1 =2$ ways to draw two vowels.  Namely:  $A$ then $E$.  And $E$ than $A$.  So of the $12$ total ways to draw two letters, there are $2$ ways to draw to vowels.  So the probability is  $\frac 2{12} = \frac 16$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 2 '17 at 5:48       fleablood   52k 2 22 65                  Thanks so much! – Minimoocha  Sep 3 '17 at 10:20        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      There are six ways to choose two letters from the word:  MAte MaTe MatE

Not sure if that's the way you guys do it, but that's the way my book teaches me.  The probability of the letter being in the word "house" is 5/26  The probability of the letter being in the word "phone" is 5/26 also.  The probability of the letter being in both "phone" and "house" is 3/26, since there are 3 letters, being o, u, and h.  So, (5/26) + (5/26) - (3/26) is equal to 7/26. That's my answer. Please correct me if I'm wrong!  Thanks for the help guys.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 10 '16 at 3:17       Justin   51 1 6                  Your answer is correct. – N.

To explain your question in terms of this concept, we could let the events   $A =$ letter chosen is part of "house"  $B =$ letter chosen is part of "phone"   Then the events $A$ and $B$ are not mutually exclusive, because both events could simultaneously happen (ie. if the letter chosen is an o, h or e).  So, to calculate the probability of $A$ OR $B$ happening, use: $P(A \text{ or } B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \text{ and } B)$, where $P(A \text{ and } B)$ is the probability of both $A$ and $B$ happening. If you don't already know this formula, you should look it up and understand why it is true.  $P(A)=5/26$ since there are $5$ distinct letters in "house" and $26$ possible letters to chose from. Similarly, $P(B)=5/26$.  $A$ and $B$ both happen iff the letter chosen is in both words - ie. the letter is o, h or e. So, $P(A \text{ and } B)=3/26$.  So $P(A \text{ or } B)=5/26 + 5/26 - 3/26 = 7/26$.  That answer can also be arrived at by considering the number of possible ways to get a letter that is in one or both of the words.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 10 '16 at 3:19       Esmath   403 4 14                  This is exactly the way I did it, thanks for confirming it! – Justin  May 10 '16 at 3:20            You're very welcome! – Esmath  May 10 '16 at 3:21        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      If you're not too comfortable yet with these probability problems, each time you work one you might want to back up and think about what the exact model for the problem is.  In this case:  Experiment: Pick one letter from the alphabet at random.  Sample space: There are 26 possible outcomes.  $S = \{a, b, c, \ldots, z\}$.  Probability distribution: The problem is implicitly assuming all choices are equally likely here, so we have $P(\{\text{letter}\}) = 1/26$ for every letter.  Event: The letter you've chosen is contained in the word "house" or "phone."  So $E = \{x \in S \mid x \text{ is one of } h, o, u, s, e, p, n \}$.  That is, $E$ is just the set $\{h, o, u, s, e, p, n\}$.  (You can break this down into a union of two separate events, as other answers are suggesting, also.)  The problem wants to know $P(E)$, which equals $P(\{h\}) + P(\{o\}) + \cdots + P(\{n\})$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 10 '16 at 3:22       DJX   410 3 13                  Thanks for the quick tips! – Justin  May 10 '16 at 3:25        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Let  $A$ = event that letter is in "house"  $\mathrm{P}(A) = \frac{5}{26}$  $B$ = event that letter is in "phone"  $\mathrm{P}(B) = \frac{5}{26}$  $A\cap B^c$ = the letter is in house but not phone

What is the likelihood of it happening 3 turns in a row?  Some assumptions are necessary. Let’s use these:   Two-player game  English tile distribution  Vowels are AEIOU (ie, exclude Y)  The situation is drawing all vowels on the first pull, followed by being in that situation on the subsequent two turns.  The subject draws first.  The opponent plays first (this probably contradicts the game rules but is convenient for this experiment).  The opponent plays a four-letter word on every turn, and that word is two consonants and two vowels.  The subject is able to play two of their vowels on each turn, requiring a draw of two new tiles.   (If any of the above assumptions is logically impossible, please correct.)  An interesting bit is that blanks can be counted as either a consonant or vowel.  Distribution of English words and letter usage is disregarded for this calculation. Though if you want to throw it in for extra interest, great.    probability  recreational-mathematics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Aug 6 '12 at 2:07       mixedmath ♦   71.1k 6 107 235        asked Aug 4 '12 at 4:11       Matt Sherman ♦   131 3              1      In general I think all-vowel hands come up because we don't use our vowels as quickly as we use our consonants.  I think it's very rare that anyone actually draws a all-vowel hand on the first turn.  But if you tend to play 2 consonants to every vowel it won't take long before you reach an all-vowel hand (Typical since it's easy to play off your opponents vowels).  Furthermore every time you draw a consonant thereafter, your temptation is to play it instantly so you get stuck in this position.  Most of my friends rarely (if ever) use the exchange option.  I use it more than anyone else I know. – dspyz  Aug 4 '12 at 5:19             I'm not too happy about the second-to-last assumption. It changes the question from "What are the chances of three consecutive hands of all vowels?" to "What are the chances... given that the opponent receives at least two consonants and two vowels on their first turn, and at least four each over two turns?" Michael Lugo's answer is quite elegant, but it only works without this assumption. – Rahul  Aug 4 '12 at 6:02            +1 for taking a real world problem and making it specific enough to have an answer. – Ross Millikan  Aug 4 '12 at 17:39        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote      The identity of the letters doesn't matter, so let's just note that there are 42 vowels, 56 consonants, and 2 blanks.  Imagine that the game starts by putting these tiles in random order, 1 through 100.  The subject draws tiles 1 through 7, and the opponent draws tiles 8 through 14.  The opponent then plays four tiles and draws tiles 15 through 18; the subject plays two tiles and draws tiles 19 and 20.  This repeats, with the opponent drawing tiles 21 through 24, and the subject drawing tiles 25 and 26.  So under your assumptions, you're asking for the probability that positions 1 through 7, 19, 20, 25, and 26 are all among the vowels.  (Blanks don't count as vowels here; if I had six vowels and a blank I don't think I'd say "I have all vowels", although I might be unhappy with my hand.)  This is the probability that, if I draw eleven tiles at random, they will all be vowels.  There are ${100 \choose 11}$ ways to choose eleven tiles; of these ${42 \choose 11}$ consist entirely of vowels. So the answer is ${42 \choose 11}/{100 \choose 11}$ which is about $3 \times 10^{-5}$.  Note that your assumptions on how many tiles the opponent is going to play don't matter at all, but your assumptions on how many tiles the subject is able to play matter quite a bit.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 4 '12 at 4:58       Michael Lugo   17.1k 3 32 73                  Actually, knowing that 8 of the opponents tiles are 4 vowels and 4 consonants reduce the set you're drawing from to 38 vowels and 52 consonants, so knowing what letters your opponent plays matters a little bit. – dspyz  Aug 4 '12 at 5:15            Good point.  So we should have ${38 \choose 11}/{92 \choose 11} \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-5}$. – Michael Lugo  Aug 4 '12 at 14:28            My answer is slightly different, as I didn't consider that you know the opponent's first play when drawing the first rack or the second play when drawing the next two.  It doesn't change much. – Ross Millikan  Aug 4 '12 at 17:53        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      The tiles are 42 vowels and 58 consonants (counting blanks as consonants, which you would if vower-rich).  The chance drawing seven vowels is $\frac {42!93!}{35!100!}\approx 0.001685$
The next turn you need to draw 2 vowels from a set of 33 vowels and 56 consonants, for a chance of $\frac {33\cdot 32}{89\cdot 88}\approx 0.1348$.  The third turn you need to draw 2 vowels from a set of 29 vowels and 54 consonants, for a chance of $\frac {29\cdot 28}{83\cdot 82}\approx 0.1193$.  The total is then  $\frac {42!93!\cdot 33 \cdot 32 \cdot 29 \cdot 28}{35!100!\cdot 89 \cdot 88 \cdot 83 \cdot 82}\approx 0.00002711$ or about $1$ in $36886$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 4 '12 at 17:51       Ross Millikan   262k 21 175 328              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .
