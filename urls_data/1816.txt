A.  What is the probability of selecting a jury of all students?  B.  What is the probability of selecting a jury of all faculty?  C.  What is the probability of selecting a jury of two students and two faculty? Edit   Answer: A. The required probability = 11c4/22c4 = 0.0451 (Ans.)  Because,  for selecting all jury from student can be done 11c4 ways and from total (11+11) =22 people , 4 jury can be selected in 22c4  ways.

Therefore, there are $\binom{6}{6}\cdot\binom{12}{6}=924$ ways to pick $12$ jurors so that $6$ are women and $6$ are men. In total, there are $\binom{18}{12}=18564$ ways to choose $12$ jurors from $18$ people. Hence, the desired probability is  $$
\frac{924}{18564}\approx 4.98\%.

The formula for calculating the binomial coefficient by hand is:   $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ – CcS  May 17 '16 at 20:04         add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

I'm not quite comprehending this properly. Here's the question:  The grade appeal process at a university requires that a jury be structured by selecting five individuals randomly from a pool of eight students and ten faculty. a. What is the probability of selecting a jury of all students (answer is 1/153) b. What is the probability of selecting a jury of all faculty (answer is 1/34) c. What is the probability of selecting a jury of two students and three faculty ( answer is 20/51).

The probability of outcome SSSSS is simply the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes, and the same is true  for FFFFF.  The justification for (c) above is that there are, once again, 8568 total outcomes, combinations of 18 things taken 5 at a time, or [18 5]. The number of successful outcomes for two S's equals 8 things taken 2 at a time, or [8 2]. Because the S and F outcomes are independent from each other, the total number of successful outcomes is obtained by multiplying the number of successful 'S' outcomes, [8 2], times the number of successful outcomes for three F's, which equals 10 things taken three at a time, or [10 3].  And lastly, this is strictly a combinatorial type problem. Permutations have nothing whatseover to do with this problem and do not enter in to the solution.  Hope this is helpful!

You have 6 changes out of 16 of picking a student for the third juror. You have 5 changes out of 15 of picking a student for the fourth juror. You have 4 changes out of 14 of picking a student for the third juror, So you would have 8/18 * 7/17 * 6/16 * 5/15 * 4/14 chances for picking all students. --------------------------------------... Similarly for the the faculty 10/18 * 9/17 * 8/16 * 7/15 * 6/14 --------------------------------------... The only solutions I can think of to the last one would be very long and complicated. You could pick two students in many different ways. 1&2, 1&3, 1&4, 1&5, 2&3, 2&4, 2&5, 3&4, 3&5, 4&5 th positions You could calculate the probably or each one and then combine them together. ---- So for example one way would be the probability of selecting a student as the 2nd and 4th member in the jury would be the probability of not selecting a student in the first position, 10/18 (i.e. select a faculty member, 10 faculty out of a total pool of 18) and the probability of selecting a student in the second position, 8/17 and the probability of not selecting a student in the third position, 9/16 ( i.e. 9 faculty left out of the remaining pool of 16) and the probability of selecting a student in the fourth position., 7/15 and the probability of not selecting a student in the fifth position. 8/14 so the probability of selecting a student as the 2d and 4th member would be the probably of all these selections occurring which would be 10/18 * 8/17 * 9/16 * 7/15 * 8/14 --- Similarly you would have to make a calculation for each of the other nine ways you could select two students and then add them up for your total probability.

A.  What is the probability of selecting a jury of all students?  B.  What is the probability of selecting a jury of all faculty?  C.  What is the probability of selecting a jury of two students and two faculty? Edit   Answer: A. The required probability = 11c4/22c4 = 0.0451 (Ans.)  Because,  for selecting all jury from student can be done 11c4 ways and from total (11+11) =22 people , 4 jury can be selected in 22c4  ways.

Therefore, there are $\binom{6}{6}\cdot\binom{12}{6}=924$ ways to pick $12$ jurors so that $6$ are women and $6$ are men. In total, there are $\binom{18}{12}=18564$ ways to choose $12$ jurors from $18$ people. Hence, the desired probability is  $$
\frac{924}{18564}\approx 4.98\%.

The formula for calculating the binomial coefficient by hand is:   $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ – CcS  May 17 '16 at 20:04         add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

I'm not quite comprehending this properly. Here's the question:  The grade appeal process at a university requires that a jury be structured by selecting five individuals randomly from a pool of eight students and ten faculty. a. What is the probability of selecting a jury of all students (answer is 1/153) b. What is the probability of selecting a jury of all faculty (answer is 1/34) c. What is the probability of selecting a jury of two students and three faculty ( answer is 20/51).  I don't know how to get to these answers.         2 following      3 answers  3    Report Abuse           Are you sure you want to delete this answer?

The probability of outcome SSSSS is simply the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes, and the same is true  for FFFFF.  The justification for (c) above is that there are, once again, 8568 total outcomes, combinations of 18 things taken 5 at a time, or [18 5]. The number of successful outcomes for two S's equals 8 things taken 2 at a time, or [8 2]. Because the S and F outcomes are independent from each other, the total number of successful outcomes is obtained by multiplying the number of successful 'S' outcomes, [8 2], times the number of successful outcomes for three F's, which equals 10 things taken three at a time, or [10 3].  And lastly, this is strictly a combinatorial type problem. Permutations have nothing whatseover to do with this problem and do not enter in to the solution.  Hope this is helpful!

You have 6 changes out of 16 of picking a student for the third juror. You have 5 changes out of 15 of picking a student for the fourth juror. You have 4 changes out of 14 of picking a student for the third juror, So you would have 8/18 * 7/17 * 6/16 * 5/15 * 4/14 chances for picking all students. --------------------------------------... Similarly for the the faculty 10/18 * 9/17 * 8/16 * 7/15 * 6/14 --------------------------------------... The only solutions I can think of to the last one would be very long and complicated. You could pick two students in many different ways. 1&2, 1&3, 1&4, 1&5, 2&3, 2&4, 2&5, 3&4, 3&5, 4&5 th positions You could calculate the probably or each one and then combine them together. ---- So for example one way would be the probability of selecting a student as the 2nd and 4th member in the jury would be the probability of not selecting a student in the first position, 10/18 (i.e. select a faculty member, 10 faculty out of a total pool of 18) and the probability of selecting a student in the second position, 8/17 and the probability of not selecting a student in the third position, 9/16 ( i.e. 9 faculty left out of the remaining pool of 16) and the probability of selecting a student in the fourth position., 7/15 and the probability of not selecting a student in the fifth position. 8/14 so the probability of selecting a student as the 2d and 4th member would be the probably of all these selections occurring which would be 10/18 * 8/17 * 9/16 * 7/15 * 8/14 --- Similarly you would have to make a calculation for each of the other nine ways you could select two students and then add them up for your total probability.
