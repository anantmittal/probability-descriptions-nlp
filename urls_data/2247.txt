 (NOAA) and other partners, Lightning Safety Week is held the last
 full week of June each year.  Lightning is one of the leading weather-related causes of death and injury in the United States. Most people do not realize that they can be struck by lightning even when the center of a thunderstorm is 10 miles (16 kilometers) away and there are blue skies overhead.

And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

You instinctively look up at the sky to see the familiar dark clouds looming in the distance.  You've still got half the yard to mow, and you're annoyed by the fact that the approaching rain will force you to wait and finish when the lawn dries.  So you hurry up and continue cutting grass, finishing just in time for the first sudden flash of bright light and loud crash of thunder that sends the neighborhood running indoors. You made it inside safely . . . this time.  But were you really in that much danger? It's true that the chances of you being injured or killed by lightning are very small.  However, it's wise to exercise a little caution along with some good old-fashioned common sense when thunderstorms are forecast for your area. The key to lightning safety is simply avoiding being in the wrong place at the wrong time .  Everyone who has ever been accidentally struck by lightning did nothing to attract the strike to them , they were simply unfortunate to be at the exact spot a lightning strike was already going to occur.  Since lightning is generated on too large of a scale (by thunderstorms several miles high and tens of miles wide) to be influenced by small objects on the ground, these lightning victims would have been hit regardless of any metal objects they did or did not have on or near their person.  This web site is made possible by support from CIS Internet .  So, the focus on protecting yourself from lightning shouldn't be on what type of objects you are wearing, standing by, or carrying, but rather on avoiding the locations where lightning can strike - which, essentially, is anywhere outdoors or in unprotected structures.  It's commonly understood, for instance, that you should stay away from trees if you are outside during a storm.  There is some merit to that statement, but the truth is that you are still in danger from lightning if you are outdoors at all. So what should you do to ensure maximum safety?  The following are the best ways to protect yourself:  Stay Inside  The safest and most obvious place to be in a thunderstorm is indoors. If lightning strikes a house or a building directly, it will tend to follow the available paths to ground, including the electrical wiring, plumbing, cable or telephone lines, antennas and/or steel framework. RIGHT: When lightning hits skyscrapers, the current is diverted safely to ground.  The building and its occupants are unaffected.  The fact that houses and buildings have an abundance of grounding paths makes them generally safe lightning shelters, but to ensure maximum safety during a storm:  Don't use any wired appliance or device.  Wireless appliances (cordless phones, razors, etc) are safe to use.  Stay away from water pipes and faucets.  (No baths, showers, etc.)  Don't stand on a basement floor or patio slab, or anywhere where standing water or excessive moisture is present. These areas are 'ground current' danger zones.  Stay away from walls where electrical wiring is present.  Lightning will occasionally jump through the air inside a house or building to reach a better grounding path, such as from electrical wires to a water pipe.  Structures like bus shelters, outhouses, lean-to shelters, or any small non-metal structure do not provide any lightning protection.    Facts and Tips       Small metal objects do not attract lightning.     Lightning doesn't always strike the tallest object.     Lightning can reach far away from a nearby thunderstorm and strike ground.     If you can see lightning or hear thunder, you are in an immediate danger zone for a lightning strike.     Especially during the summertime, lightning activity can suddenly begin in areas of rain even if no lightning or thunder has yet occurred.     When planning any outdoor events, watch the weather forecast up to the day of the activity.  Take precautions if any chances for thunderstorms are in the forecast.     During the summertime, keep an eye on the skies.  Watch for development of large, towering clouds or shafts of rain .  When in doubt, head for cover.   Head for the car If no structural shelter is available, hard-topped automobiles offer sufficient lightning protection.  Vehicles such as golf carts and convertibles do not provide any lightning shelter. Roll up the windows and don't touch any part of the metal frame (like resting your arm on the window) or any wired device in the vehicle (including the steering wheel or plugged-in cellular phone).   A direct strike to your car will flow through the frame of the vehicle and usually jump over or through the tires to reach ground.   Most lightning incidents to cars result in one or more flat tires and damage to the electrical system, but no injury to the occupants.   If lightning does hit your car, it's a good idea to stop and check the vehicle.  It's not uncommon for a strike to ignite fuel and result in a fire or explosion.  If Outdoors: You are in equal danger of a lightning injury outdoors regardless of whether or not you are standing near, carrying, or wearing any metal objects.  Lightning is a large-scale event that is not influenced by small ojects on the ground, so distancing yourself from small metal objects will not make you safe from lightning .  Metal objects like umbrellas, golf clubs, bicycles and fences will attract a lightning channel only if the strike is already a few feet away - in which case you would still experience an injury from being that close to begin with.  Jewelry, spiked shoes, watches or hair berets will do nothing to influence a lightning strike's ground termination.  However, if you are hit directly, lightning will usually flow through any metal objects on your person, superheating (even vaporizing) them and causing burns. If you are caught outside, stay away from tall, isolated objects like trees, flagpoles, or posts.   Remember that, contrary to the myth, lightning doesn't always strike the tallest or most conductive object - it can strike anywhere. Stay away from shorelines, railroad tracks, and metal fences which could bring current from a 'far-away' lightning strike to you.  Although still not as safe as being indoors, dense woods provide a little protection due to the large number of trees that decrease the chance of lightning strike to a tree next to you.  However in this (and any) case, don't stand close to any of the trees.  Lightning Warning Signs In addition to the obvious warning of an ominously darkening sky, there are certain conditions that can alert you to a lightning danger before the strikes threaten.  You are in a 'danger zone' and need to seek immediate shelter if you experience any of the following:  Raindrops or hail :  Rain of any intensity (but more so with heavy rain) may signal the presence of a thunderstorm cloud directly overhead, even if it has not yet produced any lightning or thunder .  Large, 'fat' raindrops are ominous, telltale signs of a towering cloud that has the potential to produce a lightning strike at any second.  Audible thunder or visible flashes : If you can see lightning or hear thunder at all, you are within range of the next strike.  Large, towering clouds : Cumulonimbus (thunderstorm) clouds can develop rapidly overhead, even among pleasant-looking skies, sometimes leaving no 'dark sky' appearance that often otherwise precedes a thunderstorm. A growing cumulonimbus cloud's upper edges will usually look hard and rounded, like cauliflower, as it protrudes skyward:   Numerous cumulonimbus clouds often develop in clusters and lines (rows), so a cloud like this appearing in the distance signals the potential for another one to pop up or pass directly overhead.  Static on an AM radio : Distinctive crackling and popping sounds on an AM radio indicate that lightning is occuring in your area.  Lightning Detector Alarms : Several handheld lightning detectors are on the market that sound an alarm when lightning occurs within a set distance.  These battery-operated detectors, priced at around $200, are commonly used by personnel at golf courses, pools, parks and beaches.  If your job or pasttime involves large amounts of time outdoors, a portable lightning detector could be a good investment.  Storms on weather radar : Thunderstorms show up on Doppler
weather radar as red, orange and/or yellow blobs (as in the sample at right).   Real-time weather radar is widely available on the Internet , and is shown periodically on The Weather Channel.  An Imminent Strike  A close or direct lightning strike will sometimes give you a short warning a few seconds before the event,  usually in the form of:  A soft or loud buzzing, clicking, hissing or cracking sound. A tingling sensation Hairs on the arm or head standing on end Nearby metal objects emitting a soft, blue-white glow called ' St. Elmo's Fire ' These signs indicate a direct strike may occur within seconds. In most cases, you will not have time to react.  However, if you are unable to reach shelter and you experience any of these signs, or if you otherwise feel that you are in immediate danger, assume the following position quickly: Move your feet close together, crouch down, and grab your ankles.  Tuck your head down as far as you can. Don't lie flat on the ground. Even so, this traditionally-recommended 'crouch' position may not prevent injury from a strike (there is no evidence to support it having any effect).  Again, your focus should be avoiding getting into such a situation - it's never good to have to consider using such dubious 'last resorts' to begin with.  Lightning strike victims:  Victims of lightning strikes are not always initially in a fatal situation.  Typically a lightning strike will cause cardiac and/or repiratory arrest that can be corrected by proper resuscitation (CPR).   Many lightning-related deaths occur when the victim does not receive the proper medical attention.  If you witness a lightning strike incident, call for help immediately.  If you are trained in CPR, administer proper resuscitation if it is necessary .   A lightning victim is safe to touch, in other words, they do not retain any 'electrical charge' from the strike.  Other injuries commonly caused by lightning include:  Burns Temporary or permanent hearing/vision loss Nervous system damage Muscle, ligament or bone injuries (from violent electrically-induced muscle contractions) Sometimes (even in the movies) you may hear people casually joke about actually wanting to experience a lightning strike, just to see what it's like.  But any lightning victim will tell you that the lifelong after-effects of a strike are no amusement park ride - that is, if you manage to survive.   Consider dealing with the following for the rest of your life:  Intense, uncurable chronic or steady pain (in various body parts), only manageable with constant painkiller medication Chronic headache, dizziness, nausea, seizures and/or vomiting Varying degrees of impairment to memory and various cognitive skills Vision, hearing, and/or various sensory loss/impairments and many more symptoms too numerous to list. A lightning strike can seriously alter your life as you know it.  In other words, go with your best bet: Play it safe. < Back to Weather Library  Related topics:    Extreme Lightning Photo Gallery!

(WNCN) -- There's a chance at walking away with the estimated $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot on Wednesday.  Its a 1 in 292 million chance and your odds of matching every number in that drawing are considerably less than other things, like being struck by lightning. Your odds of being struck by lightning this year are 1 in 960,000.  In your lifetime those odds drop to about 1 in 12,000.  Your odds of being struck by lightning twice in your lifetime are 1 in 9 million, which is still a higher chance than winning the Powerball. What about getting struck by lightning while drowning?  Those odds are 1 in 183 million which 63 percent higher than hitting the Powerball. Your odds of winning are better than hit by a falling satellite.   The chance of that happening is about 1 in 21 trillion.  But  with a jackpot so large it cannot even fit onto lottery billboards, its hard not to get wrapped up in the frenzy.

It can possess more power than a nuclear reactor. Rolf Maeder, Photography Sedona Somewhere in the sky, in the guts of a storm, lightning is forming. Although it's rare, with the odds of getting struck in your lifetime being roughly 1 in 12,000 , every now and then a human will provide an attractive target for lightning bolts to unleash their power. And of the roughly 500 people who are struck by lightning each year, about 90% survive. Here's what you should expect if you ever find yourself in the path of lightning. How lightning forms Although we're still not sure what causes it, scientists believe that ice particles bumping together inside a cloud can cause an excess of negative charge to collect at the bottom of the cloud. This charge can be so powerful that it repels electrons, negatively charged particles, on the ground beneath it, causing the ground to become positively charged. As an insanely strong electrical field roils in the cloud above, an intense attraction builds between the cloud and the ground. Lightning is the runaway force that discharges this field. It races toward the ground at nearly 300,000 kilometers per hour, striking the ground with a power of 300 kV, up to 150 times stronger than an industrial shock. It can even exceed the power of a nuclear reactor . When the lightning hits the ground, it causes a trail of plasma that lights the sky with those telltale zigzags of blueish white light that we see as lightning. The first three milliseconds Lichtenberg figures are a type of scarring that can occur when you've been struck by lightning. Winston Kemp A lot can happen in the three milliseconds it takes for a lightning bolt to course through your body. As the lightning strikes and then exits your body, it will leave you with deep wounds, often accompanied with third degree burns. Your hair and clothing might singe or catch fire. Your cl othes might even be shredded by the explosive force of the surrounding air being superheated to up to 50,000 degrees F ( five times hotter than the surface of the sun ). If you happen to be wearing any metal objects, like necklaces or a piercings, they could channel the electric current, superheating and searing your skin. And if the lightning exits through your feet, the force could literally knock your shoes off . Blood vessels bursting from the electric discharge and heat might create something called a Lichtenberg figure on your skin. This is a pattern of scars that branches out across your body like the limbs of a tree, likely tracing the path the electricity took as it traveled through you. It's not uncommon for the blast to rupture your eardrums, possibly leading to hearing loss. And, of course, you can expect a whole world of pain. One victim recalled it as " the pain of a thousand wasps stinging from within ." In the wake of a lightning strike Immediately after being struck, the disruption the lightning would have caused to your heart's electrical rhythm could result in cardiac arrest , one of the leading causes of death in lightning strike victims. The shock could also cause seizures or respiratory arrest. If the electric current enters your skull, it could literally cook your brain, resulting in brain damage or putting you in a coma. The strike could even cause temporary or permanent paralysis. But it doesn't end there. In the wake of a lightning attack, you might be faced with a lifetime of neurological afflictions for reasons that scientists still don't fully understand. Some scientists believe that the lightning scrambles your internal circuitry , altering the behavior of your cells. You might undergo personality changes, mood swings, and memory loss. It's also possible that you will suffer from chronic pain and constant Parkinson's-like muscle twitches. In some cases, however, a lightning strike can lead to strange super talents. In a blog post for Psychology Today, University of Miami neuroscientist Berit Brogaard writes about an incident where an orthopedic surgeon who was struck by lightning developed an urge to learn to play the piano. He began to compose music he had mysteriously started hearing in his head since the strike. After a few months he abandoned his career as a surgeon and became a classical musician. This type of phenomenon baffles scientists. One theory that Brogaard says is currently being tested is that cell death caused by being struck by lightning could cause a one-time flooding of the brain with neurotransmitters that are released from the dying neurons. This causes a rewiring of neurons, providing access to areas of the brain that were previously inaccessible. But as cool as it would be, you shouldn't count on that stray bolt of electricity turning you into a prodigy in one swift flash. The overwhelming majority of consequences of being struck by lightning are painful and debilitating, and could stay with you for the rest of your life. While your chances of being struck by lightning are low, you can stay safe by tossing aside that fishing pole or golf club when you see clouds forming and heading indoors.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: COURTESY OF EDWARD J. RUPKE Advertisement  Edward J. Rupke, senior engineer at Lightning Technologies, Inc., (LTI) in Pittsfield, Mass., provides the following explanation:  It is estimated that on average, each airplane in the U.S. commercial fleet is struck lightly by lightning more than once each year. In fact, aircraft often trigger lightning when flying through a heavily charged region of a cloud. In these instances, the lightning flash originates at the airplane and extends away in opposite directions. Although record keeping is poor, smaller business and private airplanes are thought to be struck less frequently because of their small size and because they often can avoid weather that is conducive to lightning strikes.  The last confirmed commercial plane crash in the U.S. directly attributed to lightning occurred in 1967, when lightning caused a catastrophic fuel tank explosion. Since then, much has been learned about how lightning can affect airplanes. As a result, protection techniques have improved. Today, airplanes receive a rigorous set of lightning certification tests to verify the safety of their designs.  Although passengers and crew may see a flash and hear a loud noise if lightning strikes their plane, nothing serious should happen because of the careful lightning protection engineered into the aircraft and its sensitive components. Initially, the lightning will attach to an extremity such as the nose or wing tip. The airplane then flies through the lightning flash, which reattaches itself to the fuselage at other locations while the airplane is in the electric "circuit" between the cloud regions of opposite polarity. The current will travel through the conductive exterior skin and structures of the aircraft and exit off some other extremity, such as the tail. Pilots occasionally report temporary flickering of lights or short-lived interference with instruments.  Most aircraft skins consist primarily of aluminum, which conducts electricity very well. By making sure that no gaps exist in this conductive path, the engineer can assure that most of the lightning current will remain on the exterior of the aircraft. Some modern aircraft are made of advanced composite materials, which by themselves are significantly less conductive than aluminum. In this case, the composites contain an embedded layer of conductive fibers or screens designed to carry lightning currents.  Modern passenger jets have miles of wires and dozens of computers and other instruments that control everything from the engines to the passengers' headsets. These computers, like all computers, are sometimes susceptible to upset from power surges. So, in addition to safeguarding the aircraft's exterior, the lightning protection engineer must make sure that no damaging surges or transients can reach the sensitive equipment inside the aircraft. Lightning traveling on the exterior skin of an aircraft has the potential to induce transients into wires or equipment beneath the skin. These transients are called lightning indirect effects. Careful shielding, grounding and the application of surge suppression devices avert problems caused by indirect effects in cables and equipment when necessary. Every circuit and piece of equipment that is critical or essential to the safe flight and landing of an aircraft must be verified by the manufacturers to be protected against lightning in accordance with regulations set by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or a similar authority in the country of the aircraft's origin.  The other main area of concern is the fuel system, where even a tiny spark could be disastrous. Engineers thus take extreme precautions to ensure that lightning currents cannot cause sparks in any portion of an aircraft's fuel system. The aircraft skin around the fuel tanks must be thick enough to withstand a burn through. All of the structural joints and fasteners must be tightly designed to prevent sparks, because lightning current passes from one section to another. Access doors, fuel filler caps and any vents must be designed and tested to withstand lightning. All the pipes and fuel lines that carry fuel to the engines, and the engines themselves, must be protected against lightning. In addition, new fuels that produce less explosive vapors are now widely used. The aircraft's radome¿the nose cone that contains radar and other flight instruments¿is another area to which lightning protection engineers pay special attention. In order to function, radar cannot be contained within a conductive enclosure. Instead, lightning diverter strips applied along the outer surface of the radome protect this area. These strips can consist of solid metal bars or a series of closely spaced buttons of conductive material affixed to a plastic strip that is bonded adhesively to the radome. In many ways, diverter strips function like a lightning rod on a building.  Private general aviation planes should avoid flying through or near thunderstorms. The severe turbulence found in storm cells alone should make the pilot of a small plane very wary. The FAA has a separate set of regulations governing the lightning protection of private aircraft that do not transport passengers. A basic level of protection is provided for the airframe, fuel system and engines. Traditionally, most small, commercially made aircraft have aluminum skins and do not contain computerized engine and flight controls, and they are thus inherently less susceptible to lightning; however, numerous reports of noncatastrophic damage to wing tips, propellers and navigation lights have been recorded.  The growing class of kit-built composite aircraft also raises some concerns. Because the FAA considers owner-assembled, kit-built aircraft "experimental," they are not subject to lightning protection regulations. Many kit-built planes are made of fiberglass or graphite-reinforced composites. At LTI we routinely test protected fiberglass and composite panels with simulated lightning currents. The results of these tests show that lightning can damage inadequately protected composites. Pilots of unprotected fiberglass or composite aircraft should not fly anywhere near a lightning storm or in other types of clouds, because nonthunderstorm clouds may contain sufficient electric charge to produce lightning.

That talking on the telephone is the leading cause of lightning injuries inside the home? That standing under a tall tree is one of the most dangerous places to take shelter? And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

By DAN ROBINSON Storm Chaser/Photographer                   Tweet                If you know your house has just been hit directly by lightning, call the fire department . It is common for lightning to start fires in the attic and within walls of homes.  These fires inside enclosed spaces may not be visible in their beginning stages.   A cloud-to-ground lightning bolt's main objective is to find the path of least resistance from the cloud to deep into the ground.   Most houses are filled with many potential routes for lightning to follow in its journey.   This can include gas and water pipes, electric lines, phone lines, cable TV/internet lines, gutters, downspouts, metal window frames - anything conductive in a house is 'fair game' for the lightning to follow.   Lightning doesn't need conductive objects to reach ground, however - it's just forged its way through miles of air, so conductive objects in a house are a mere 'convenience' that it will use if they are available. AT RIGHT: Lightning strikes a tree and house in Charleston, West Virginia in 1998.  Lightning passing through a house will often 'branch' and utilize more than one path to ground at a time.   It can also jump through the air from one conductive path to another in what is called a side flash .  For example, lightning may first connect to electric lines in the attic of a house, then jump to better-grounded water pipes on the first or second floor.  Lightning can connect to gutters, then jump to a window frame as a 'stepping stone' to the electrical system or water pipes.  All or part of bolts have been seen jumping from wall outlets to sink faucets and even across rooms!  Animation showing possible lightning paths to ground inside of a house  Lightning current will produce significant damage to a house that is not equipped with a good protection system .  Professionally-installed lightning protection systems are expensive and the risk of a direct strike is low, so most homes do not have them. Lightning presents three main hazards to a house that is hit directly:   Fire danger :  The biggest danger lightning poses to a house is fire .  Wood and other flammable building materials can easily be ignited anywhere an exposed lightning channel comes in contact with (or passes through) them.  It is most common for lightning to start a fire in the attic or roof of a house, as the channel usually has to pass through some of the structural material in the roof before it can reach a more conductive path such as wiring or pipes.  When lightning current travels through wires, it will commonly burn them up - presenting a fire ingition hazard anywhere along the affected circuits.   Power surge damage : If lightning chooses any of the home's electrical wiring as its primary or secondary path, the explosive surge can damage even non-electronic appliances that are connected.  Even if most of the lightning current takes other paths to ground, the home's electrical system will experience enough of a surge to cause potentially significant damage to anything connected to it, electronics in particular.   Shock wave damage : Another major source of damage from lightning is produced from the explosive shock wave .  The shock waves that lightning create is what produces the thunder that we hear, and at close range, these waves can be destructive.  Lightning can easily fracture concrete, brick, cinderblock and stone.   Brick and stone chimneys are commonly damaged severely by lightning.   Lightning's shock waves can blow out plaster walls, shatter glass, create trenches in soil and crack foundations.  Shrapnel is a common secondary damage effect, with objects sometimes found embedded in walls! What about a structure that has no wiring or pipes?  It is rare for a house to be devoid of electrically conductive paths to ground, but they do exist - such as camping/fishing cabins.  In that case, all bets are off on how the lightning will choose to reach the ground.   Again, the lightning has just jumped across miles of non-conductive air, so the lack of wires or pipes won't stop it from passing through a completely non-conductive structure.   Such a structure does not provide a person with good lightning protection - so if you are caught in one during a storm, consider moving into a hard-topped automobile which provides a much better degree of safety.  This web site is made possible by support from CIS Internet .  What can you do to stay safe from lightning while inside of your house?  Since we know the common paths lightning can follow in a house (wiring and pipes), the best thing to do is stay away from those paths as best as possible during a storm.  Direct contact with them should be avoided.  This includes taking a shower or bath, washing hands, doing dishes, typing on a computer, playing video games and using a wired phone, tool or appliance.  Metal-framed windows should be avoided.  Wireless devices are safe to use (cell phones, cordless phones, remotes, etc). Direct skin contact with earth ground should also be avoided, as lightning current can travel through soil and across wet/damp concrete.  Wear shoes if walking in a basement, garage or patio.  What to do if lightning strikes your house  If your home is hit directly by lightning, your immediate concern should be for any fires that may have been ignited. Call the fire department! Again, the most common place for lightning-caused fires in a home is in the attic, but they can start anywhere the lightning has traveled.  Some fires inside the walls and attic may not be immediately apparent and not easily accessible.   You should also watch for falling debris from damaged chimneys, shingles or walls. You should also strongly consider contacting an electrician to have your home's electrical system inspected for any damage that might present a future fire hazard.  Can you get struck by lightning inside of a house?  While it is rare, yes, it is possible to receive a lightning injury inside a house.  Burns and electric shock injuries can occur when someone is in direct contact with one of lightning's chosen paths to ground.   The most common indoor lightning injuries involve a person talking on a corded phone or resting on/looking out of a metal-framed window.  "Side flashes" (discussed above) that jump across rooms can also cause injuries, but are very rare.  Indirect shrapnel-related injuries from building materials have also been documented.  How to protect sensitive electronics from a strike  It is nearly impossible to provide 100% protection to sensitive electronics from a direct lightning strike.  The best thing to do is to unplug any high-value item you wish to protect during storms, as surge protectors and UPS units can't provide direct-strike protection.   Some could argue that the risk of a direct strike to any given house is too low to justify unplugging everything for every storm that passes overhead.  It's wise to make sure your homeowner's or renter's insurance covers lightning damage.  Your insured expensive electronics can be replaced, after all.   However, consider irreplaceables such as the data saved on your computer (photos, videos, work files, etc).  You can mitigate that risk by performing frequent offsite backups and/or storing data on an external hard drive that you can unplug when needed.  Should I have a lightning protection system installed?  Animation showing how a lightning protection system works   A professionally-installed and well-grounded lightning protection system will reduce or eliminate the fire and injury hazards if your house happens to be struck directly.  You will want to assess the risk of a strike and weigh the costs versus benefits.  Insurance may be a more cost-effective option, especially if you live in an area of average to below-average thunderstorm frequency.   If you are located in a zone if frequent lightning activity (such as Florida and the Gulf Coast regions of the USA), a protection system may offer more of a benefit.

According to the NWS Storm Data , over the last    30 years (1987-2016)   the U.S. has averaged 47 reported lightning fatalities per year.  Only about 10% of people who are struck by lightning    are  killed, leaving 90% with various degrees of disability.  More recently, in the last 10 years (2007-2016), the U.S. has averaged 30 lightning fatalities.

Apparently, the chances are 300,000 to one, according to David Hand in his new book: The Improbability Principle. But while 300,000 to one looks like a minor risk for an individual, there are lots of people on the planet.  Small Data  A series on curious numbers cropping up in the news, by stats watcher Anthony Reuben  As a result, about 24,000 people are killed by lightning each year. Remember, you don't have to be struck by lightning to be killed by it - you could be in a house that's struck by lightning and burns down with you inside. Indeed, with seven billion people on the planet, what would be really, really unlikely would be that nobody was killed by lightning. Of course, 300,000 to one is an average - people in the developing world who spend less time indoors and have fewer tall buildings and more flammable ones are much more likely to be killed by lightning than people in developed ones. On average, three people are killed each year by lightning in the UK, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which are odds 66 times shorter than the global average. Hand's book sets out to explain why things that are considered to be very unlikely keep on happening. It's not just that people win the lottery. Again, while that's unlikely for an individual, it's pretty likely that someone will win it each week. No, we're talking about really unlikely things, like the lottery drawing the same numbers in two consecutive weeks, as happened on the Bulgarian Lottery in 2009. So, if you wait around long enough, it looks like you'll get to see almost anything happen. But not a man being struck by lightning twice in succession, seen on a security camera. The video of that, which Hand showed as part of a talk to the Royal Statistical Society on Thursday, is widely described on the internet as having been a fake. Maybe we'll have to wait a bit longer to see that.

We’ve all heard the reality check before: “You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery.”  To most of us, the odds of being struck by lightning, “ 1 in a million ,” are a convenient measuring rod for all things unlikely. Whether it’s winning the lottery or dying in a plane crash, if something is less likely to happen to you than being struck by lightning, then, as the logic goes, it’s probably not worth holding your breath for or worrying about very much (discussions along these very lines can be found here and here ).    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT       Lightning Odds…Not So Simple…  The odds of being struck by lightning, however, are not as simple as we would have them to be. The answer to the question, “What are the odds of being struck by lightning?” is actually, “It depends.”    The Numbers Behind '1 in a Million' That the odds of being struck by lightning are approximately 1 in a million is perhaps one of the most well-known statistics out there. This statistic is nonetheless, an average of the odds of being struck by lightning in the United States. According to the U.S. National Weather Service, this statistic is based on averages of reported lightning deaths and injuries along a U.S. population estimate: Estimated U.S. population as of 2011: 310,000,000 Average Annual Reported U.S. Lightning Deaths and Injures, 2001-2010: 280 Odds of being struck by lightning in a given year  (reported deaths + injuries) =1 in (310,000,000/280) = 1 in 1,107,143 =  Approximately 1 in a million  What’s particularly noteworthy is that depending on which state you’re in within the United States, your odds of being struck by lightning this year can be much higher or much lower than that 1 in a million figure mentioned above. For example, based on lightning data (courtesy StruckByLightning.org ) and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for 2011 presented in the map below, if you live in Montana, your odds of being struck by lightning are roughly 1 in 249,550, considerably higher than the the national average of 1 in a million. Towards the other end of the spectrum, in California, your odds of being struck by lightning are far lower at 1 in 7,538,382.  Lightning Map The Odds of Being Struck By Lightning, By State Click on this map to see the odds of being struck by lightning in your state (based on 2011 lightning data).  Clearly, the odds of being struck by lightning are not the same for everyone, everywhere, but why?  We face varying odds of being struck by lightning because of a few key factors. These essentially location-specific factors include: Cloud-to-ground lightning density rates, population size, indoor vs. outdoor activity setting and safety adherence. Now Available on Amazon  Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities by Jeffrey Rosenthal From terrorist attacks to big money jackpots, Struck by Lightning  deconstructs the odds and oddities of chance, examining both the relevant and irreverent role of randomness in our everyday lives..airplanes crash, bridges collapse, and we never know if we’ll be that one in a million statistic. A basic understanding of the rules of probability theory, applied to real-life circumstances, can help us to make sense of these situations, to avoid unnecessary fear, to seize the opportunities that randomness presents to us, and to actually enjoy the uncertainties we face. In this entertaining yet sophisticated look at the world of probabilities, author Jeffrey Rosenthal–an improbably talented math professor–explains the mechanics of randomness and teaches us how to develop an informed perspective on probability. U.S. Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Density This Vaisala National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) map shows the average annual lightning flash density within the continental U.S. from 1997-2011. In terms of cloud-to-ground lightning averages, Florida ranks highest, with an average of 1,414,284 flashes per year (24.7 flashes per square mile). Historically, Florida has also experienced the highest lightning number of lightning deaths in the United States, with 425 deaths occurring there from 1950-2003. Washington has the lowest cloud-to-ground lightning averages, 20,510 flashes per year (0.3 flashes per square mile). Population State population plays in a key role in determining your odds of being struck by lightning. Florida tops all the states both in terms of cloud-to-ground lightning density and the number of lightning casualties reported annually (31 in 2011), but because of Florida’s population size, an estimated 19,057,542 for 2011, the odds of being struck by lightning there were 1 in 614,759. These odds are lower  than Montana’s 1 in 249,550, even though Montana had only 4 lightning casualties, because in comparison, Montana’s estimated 2011 population was much smaller: 998,199. Indoor vs. Outdoor Simply put, more time spent outdoors increases the odds of being struck by lightning. In places where people work and engage in more activities outdoors, the odds of being struck by lightning tend to be higher. Lightning Fatalities: What Are the Odds of Being Killed by Lightning? According to U.S. NWS Storm Data for the 30 year period spanning the years 1984-2013, about 10% of people, or 1 in 10, struck by lightning are killed  . A recent report, A Detailed Analysis of Lightning Deaths in the United States from 2006 through 2013 , by lightning safety specialist, John S. Jensenius, Jr. at the National Weather Service, NOAA, revealed the following insights into lightning deaths:    Males accounted for 81% of lightning fatalities.  More than 70% of lightning deaths occurred in the months of June, July and August.  Slightly more lightning deaths happened on Saturdays and Sundays than other days of the week.  Individuals in the age range of 10-60 comprised the greatest number of lightning fatalities, with the 20-29 age bracket having the highest concentration of lightning fatalities.  64% of lightning deaths were related to leisure activities, followed by 17% of lightning deaths related to daily routine and 15% related to work.   Did You Know? As discussed in a USA Today article by Doyle Rice, there has been an overall decline in lightning fatalities in the U.S. since 1940, largely due to the impact of public education efforts and increased public recognition of the value of following safety principles.  Lightning Safety The U.S. National Weather Service cautions that when there is a thunderstorm in the area, no place outside that is safe. Moreover, if you can hear thunder, that means that lightning is, in fact, close enough to strike you . If you are outdoors when you hear thunder, seek safe shelter. In short, when it comes to lightning, the message that lightning experts and organizations regard as being the most crucial is to go indoors when there is a thunderstorm in the area. Thus, the National Weather Service , StruckByLighting.org and others have worked hard to get the simple message out: “ When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors!” Featured Image Credit: Brilhasti1/Flickr     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Email Print    Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

Supposing you live to be 85, that's 2 million people in your lifetime. On 7 billion people alive today, that's a lifetime chance of 1 in 3500 -- your chances are pretty slim anyway :)  But, to be more elaborate: your chances of being struck depend entirely on your surroundings. As you indicated, you're going to be near your house, which is of course much higher than your body height, and thus closer to any lightning cloud, and thus a much more likely target for lightning to strike. Provided you have a lightning rod (or similar) installed, the rod is the most direct way for a bolt to go into the ground, and will therefore considerably decrease your chances of being struck (NOT reduce it to zero though -- lightning is pretty predictable, until it's not).  There are a few caveats here -- if you do not have a lightning rod, your house is all wet from the rain, and you're touching a doorknob or standing near a pillar or something, a bolt may choose to use your body as a "least resistance" path to the ground (although water lines or power lines inside your wall still form a much more likely candidate). When a storm is directly overhead, alway open doors, windows, etc. with your right hand, while standing on your right leg -- this reduces the chances of the current moving through your heart in the (unlikely) event you are struck this way.  Also, if the bolt is conducted into the ground by a rod (or a tree or power line or similar), and you're standing near the point of entry, there may be secondary effects that can harm you (indirect impact). These are on average much less severe than a direct hit, but are known to have been lethal in some cases.  If you're NOT going to be near your house, make sure you're going to stand near tall things ( NEAR , not under). Be sure to stay well out of the region where the tall thing might reach you should it be struck, break and fall.  Suppose worst comes to worst: you find yourself in the middle of a severe thunderstorm in an open field. In that case -- if you can find a (few) long stick(s), or have one of those tents supported by fiberglass sticks with you, stick them in the ground, straight up, in a large circular pattern, before the storm is directly overhead. If there is no time, just skip it! Then (in the center of the circle) make yourself as small as you possibly can, while also making as little contact with the ground as possible. That is, crouch down, keep your head low between your knees, standing on the balls of your feet, keep your feet close together, and start praying. Stay that way until the worst of the storm has passed. Don't even look up until you are sure that the average time between lightning and thunder is at least a second.  But the very best thing you can do is of course avoid these situations all together. Inside your house, or a cafeteria, motel, pub, any place inside you can find, is the safest place to be. Inside a car is also perfectly safe due to it being an effective Farraday cage. Really anything you can find, a bus stop, stable, a cave (if you're in the mountains, God forbid), hunter's cabin, anything.  This is what I always got as advice from guides I met on hiking trips. I always stuck to it, but actually, I never verified any of it :) (aside from the odd documentary on TV).     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 12 '12 at 9:40       Rody Oldenhuis   556 6 8                  Great first post, +1! – berry120  Jul 12 '12 at 11:18            My dad would always take us to a mostly open field so we could enjoy the lightening storm better.

This bolt of energy has neither rhyme nor reason to where it hits. It can strike directly beneath the cloud that generates it or stretch 18 miles away. To prevent this capricious element of nature from hitting your home is not always possible, but protecting your house is.       How Lightning Works  The National Weather Service maintains that the mechanism of lightning creation is still unknown. One of the most accepted theories is the separation of electrical fields within the cloud. The cloud develops a positive charge in its top half and a negative charge in its lower half. A positive charge also develops on the ground below. Ice particles must also be present for lightning formation. The positive ions on the ground tend to climb up tall objects, such as telephone poles, trees and houses or collect in open areas, such as baseball fields and meadows. An invisible channel of negative ions from the cloud, called a step leader, reaches down to the positive ground ions as they reach up. When they connect, lightning occurs.   Areas of High and Low Lightning Activity  San Francisco is fortunate to be in one of the areas least hit by lightning strikes. According to the National Severe Storms Laboratory, San Francisco and most of the Pacific west coast receive the least amount of lightning flashes in the United States. The highest concentration of lightning occurs in Florida. However, terrain does play a part in where lightning strikes. Your house has a greater chance of being hit on a hilltop than on a hillside. That can be relevant in San Francisco.     Protecting Your Home's Exterior  Lightning rods will not keep lightning from striking but will help direct it safely away from your home if properly installed. Ensure lightning rods are attached to your house’s roof securely and embedded in the ground by a cable. Lightning also tends to travel across the ground, so if you’re considering planting trees in your yard, keep the taller ones at a safe distance from your house. You may want to invest in a lightning system installed by a professional company that takes your entire house, surrounding structures and landscaping into consideration when grounding for lightning strikes.   Protecting the Interior  Lightning can damage the electronics, telephone and other systems in your house connected to an electrical outlet. The easiest way to protect your appliances is to unplug them when you first hear the clap of thunder. Surge protectors can help but are not fail-proof if the strike is a powerful one. To protect family members, stay away from all plumbing including toilets, sinks and faucets as the pipes of your house make excellent conductors. Stay off the phone as well. According to the National Weather Service, 4 percent to 5 percent of people struck by lightning were talking on their corded phones.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
 (NOAA) and other partners, Lightning Safety Week is held the last
 full week of June each year.  Lightning is one of the leading weather-related causes of death and injury in the United States. Most people do not realize that they can be struck by lightning even when the center of a thunderstorm is 10 miles (16 kilometers) away and there are blue skies overhead.

That talking on the telephone is the leading cause of lightning injuries inside the home? That standing under a tall tree is one of the most dangerous places to take shelter? And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

You instinctively look up at the sky to see the familiar dark clouds looming in the distance.  You've still got half the yard to mow, and you're annoyed by the fact that the approaching rain will force you to wait and finish when the lawn dries.  So you hurry up and continue cutting grass, finishing just in time for the first sudden flash of bright light and loud crash of thunder that sends the neighborhood running indoors. You made it inside safely . . . this time.  But were you really in that much danger? It's true that the chances of you being injured or killed by lightning are very small.  However, it's wise to exercise a little caution along with some good old-fashioned common sense when thunderstorms are forecast for your area. The key to lightning safety is simply avoiding being in the wrong place at the wrong time .  Everyone who has ever been accidentally struck by lightning did nothing to attract the strike to them , they were simply unfortunate to be at the exact spot a lightning strike was already going to occur.  Since lightning is generated on too large of a scale (by thunderstorms several miles high and tens of miles wide) to be influenced by small objects on the ground, these lightning victims would have been hit regardless of any metal objects they did or did not have on or near their person.  This web site is made possible by support from CIS Internet .  So, the focus on protecting yourself from lightning shouldn't be on what type of objects you are wearing, standing by, or carrying, but rather on avoiding the locations where lightning can strike - which, essentially, is anywhere outdoors or in unprotected structures.  It's commonly understood, for instance, that you should stay away from trees if you are outside during a storm.  There is some merit to that statement, but the truth is that you are still in danger from lightning if you are outdoors at all. So what should you do to ensure maximum safety?  The following are the best ways to protect yourself:  Stay Inside  The safest and most obvious place to be in a thunderstorm is indoors. If lightning strikes a house or a building directly, it will tend to follow the available paths to ground, including the electrical wiring, plumbing, cable or telephone lines, antennas and/or steel framework. RIGHT: When lightning hits skyscrapers, the current is diverted safely to ground.  The building and its occupants are unaffected.  The fact that houses and buildings have an abundance of grounding paths makes them generally safe lightning shelters, but to ensure maximum safety during a storm:  Don't use any wired appliance or device.  Wireless appliances (cordless phones, razors, etc) are safe to use.  Stay away from water pipes and faucets.  (No baths, showers, etc.)  Don't stand on a basement floor or patio slab, or anywhere where standing water or excessive moisture is present. These areas are 'ground current' danger zones.  Stay away from walls where electrical wiring is present.  Lightning will occasionally jump through the air inside a house or building to reach a better grounding path, such as from electrical wires to a water pipe.  Structures like bus shelters, outhouses, lean-to shelters, or any small non-metal structure do not provide any lightning protection.    Facts and Tips       Small metal objects do not attract lightning.     Lightning doesn't always strike the tallest object.     Lightning can reach far away from a nearby thunderstorm and strike ground.     If you can see lightning or hear thunder, you are in an immediate danger zone for a lightning strike.     Especially during the summertime, lightning activity can suddenly begin in areas of rain even if no lightning or thunder has yet occurred.     When planning any outdoor events, watch the weather forecast up to the day of the activity.  Take precautions if any chances for thunderstorms are in the forecast.     During the summertime, keep an eye on the skies.  Watch for development of large, towering clouds or shafts of rain .  When in doubt, head for cover.   Head for the car If no structural shelter is available, hard-topped automobiles offer sufficient lightning protection.  Vehicles such as golf carts and convertibles do not provide any lightning shelter. Roll up the windows and don't touch any part of the metal frame (like resting your arm on the window) or any wired device in the vehicle (including the steering wheel or plugged-in cellular phone).   A direct strike to your car will flow through the frame of the vehicle and usually jump over or through the tires to reach ground.   Most lightning incidents to cars result in one or more flat tires and damage to the electrical system, but no injury to the occupants.   If lightning does hit your car, it's a good idea to stop and check the vehicle.  It's not uncommon for a strike to ignite fuel and result in a fire or explosion.  If Outdoors: You are in equal danger of a lightning injury outdoors regardless of whether or not you are standing near, carrying, or wearing any metal objects.  Lightning is a large-scale event that is not influenced by small ojects on the ground, so distancing yourself from small metal objects will not make you safe from lightning .  Metal objects like umbrellas, golf clubs, bicycles and fences will attract a lightning channel only if the strike is already a few feet away - in which case you would still experience an injury from being that close to begin with.  Jewelry, spiked shoes, watches or hair berets will do nothing to influence a lightning strike's ground termination.  However, if you are hit directly, lightning will usually flow through any metal objects on your person, superheating (even vaporizing) them and causing burns. If you are caught outside, stay away from tall, isolated objects like trees, flagpoles, or posts.   Remember that, contrary to the myth, lightning doesn't always strike the tallest or most conductive object - it can strike anywhere. Stay away from shorelines, railroad tracks, and metal fences which could bring current from a 'far-away' lightning strike to you.  Although still not as safe as being indoors, dense woods provide a little protection due to the large number of trees that decrease the chance of lightning strike to a tree next to you.  However in this (and any) case, don't stand close to any of the trees.  Lightning Warning Signs In addition to the obvious warning of an ominously darkening sky, there are certain conditions that can alert you to a lightning danger before the strikes threaten.  You are in a 'danger zone' and need to seek immediate shelter if you experience any of the following:  Raindrops or hail :  Rain of any intensity (but more so with heavy rain) may signal the presence of a thunderstorm cloud directly overhead, even if it has not yet produced any lightning or thunder .  Large, 'fat' raindrops are ominous, telltale signs of a towering cloud that has the potential to produce a lightning strike at any second.  Audible thunder or visible flashes : If you can see lightning or hear thunder at all, you are within range of the next strike.  Large, towering clouds : Cumulonimbus (thunderstorm) clouds can develop rapidly overhead, even among pleasant-looking skies, sometimes leaving no 'dark sky' appearance that often otherwise precedes a thunderstorm. A growing cumulonimbus cloud's upper edges will usually look hard and rounded, like cauliflower, as it protrudes skyward:   Numerous cumulonimbus clouds often develop in clusters and lines (rows), so a cloud like this appearing in the distance signals the potential for another one to pop up or pass directly overhead.  Static on an AM radio : Distinctive crackling and popping sounds on an AM radio indicate that lightning is occuring in your area.  Lightning Detector Alarms : Several handheld lightning detectors are on the market that sound an alarm when lightning occurs within a set distance.  These battery-operated detectors, priced at around $200, are commonly used by personnel at golf courses, pools, parks and beaches.  If your job or pasttime involves large amounts of time outdoors, a portable lightning detector could be a good investment.  Storms on weather radar : Thunderstorms show up on Doppler
weather radar as red, orange and/or yellow blobs (as in the sample at right).   Real-time weather radar is widely available on the Internet , and is shown periodically on The Weather Channel.  An Imminent Strike  A close or direct lightning strike will sometimes give you a short warning a few seconds before the event,  usually in the form of:  A soft or loud buzzing, clicking, hissing or cracking sound. A tingling sensation Hairs on the arm or head standing on end Nearby metal objects emitting a soft, blue-white glow called ' St. Elmo's Fire ' These signs indicate a direct strike may occur within seconds. In most cases, you will not have time to react.  However, if you are unable to reach shelter and you experience any of these signs, or if you otherwise feel that you are in immediate danger, assume the following position quickly: Move your feet close together, crouch down, and grab your ankles.  Tuck your head down as far as you can. Don't lie flat on the ground. Even so, this traditionally-recommended 'crouch' position may not prevent injury from a strike (there is no evidence to support it having any effect).  Again, your focus should be avoiding getting into such a situation - it's never good to have to consider using such dubious 'last resorts' to begin with.  Lightning strike victims:  Victims of lightning strikes are not always initially in a fatal situation.  Typically a lightning strike will cause cardiac and/or repiratory arrest that can be corrected by proper resuscitation (CPR).   Many lightning-related deaths occur when the victim does not receive the proper medical attention.  If you witness a lightning strike incident, call for help immediately.  If you are trained in CPR, administer proper resuscitation if it is necessary .   A lightning victim is safe to touch, in other words, they do not retain any 'electrical charge' from the strike.  Other injuries commonly caused by lightning include:  Burns Temporary or permanent hearing/vision loss Nervous system damage Muscle, ligament or bone injuries (from violent electrically-induced muscle contractions) Sometimes (even in the movies) you may hear people casually joke about actually wanting to experience a lightning strike, just to see what it's like.  But any lightning victim will tell you that the lifelong after-effects of a strike are no amusement park ride - that is, if you manage to survive.   Consider dealing with the following for the rest of your life:  Intense, uncurable chronic or steady pain (in various body parts), only manageable with constant painkiller medication Chronic headache, dizziness, nausea, seizures and/or vomiting Varying degrees of impairment to memory and various cognitive skills Vision, hearing, and/or various sensory loss/impairments and many more symptoms too numerous to list. A lightning strike can seriously alter your life as you know it.  In other words, go with your best bet: Play it safe. < Back to Weather Library  Related topics:    Extreme Lightning Photo Gallery!

(WNCN) -- There's a chance at walking away with the estimated $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot on Wednesday.  Its a 1 in 292 million chance and your odds of matching every number in that drawing are considerably less than other things, like being struck by lightning. Your odds of being struck by lightning this year are 1 in 960,000.  In your lifetime those odds drop to about 1 in 12,000.  Your odds of being struck by lightning twice in your lifetime are 1 in 9 million, which is still a higher chance than winning the Powerball. What about getting struck by lightning while drowning?  Those odds are 1 in 183 million which 63 percent higher than hitting the Powerball. Your odds of winning are better than hit by a falling satellite.   The chance of that happening is about 1 in 21 trillion.  But  with a jackpot so large it cannot even fit onto lottery billboards, its hard not to get wrapped up in the frenzy.

It can possess more power than a nuclear reactor. Rolf Maeder, Photography Sedona Somewhere in the sky, in the guts of a storm, lightning is forming. Although it's rare, with the odds of getting struck in your lifetime being roughly 1 in 12,000 , every now and then a human will provide an attractive target for lightning bolts to unleash their power. And of the roughly 500 people who are struck by lightning each year, about 90% survive. Here's what you should expect if you ever find yourself in the path of lightning. How lightning forms Although we're still not sure what causes it, scientists believe that ice particles bumping together inside a cloud can cause an excess of negative charge to collect at the bottom of the cloud. This charge can be so powerful that it repels electrons, negatively charged particles, on the ground beneath it, causing the ground to become positively charged. As an insanely strong electrical field roils in the cloud above, an intense attraction builds between the cloud and the ground. Lightning is the runaway force that discharges this field. It races toward the ground at nearly 300,000 kilometers per hour, striking the ground with a power of 300 kV, up to 150 times stronger than an industrial shock. It can even exceed the power of a nuclear reactor . When the lightning hits the ground, it causes a trail of plasma that lights the sky with those telltale zigzags of blueish white light that we see as lightning. The first three milliseconds Lichtenberg figures are a type of scarring that can occur when you've been struck by lightning. Winston Kemp A lot can happen in the three milliseconds it takes for a lightning bolt to course through your body. As the lightning strikes and then exits your body, it will leave you with deep wounds, often accompanied with third degree burns. Your hair and clothing might singe or catch fire. Your cl othes might even be shredded by the explosive force of the surrounding air being superheated to up to 50,000 degrees F ( five times hotter than the surface of the sun ). If you happen to be wearing any metal objects, like necklaces or a piercings, they could channel the electric current, superheating and searing your skin. And if the lightning exits through your feet, the force could literally knock your shoes off . Blood vessels bursting from the electric discharge and heat might create something called a Lichtenberg figure on your skin. This is a pattern of scars that branches out across your body like the limbs of a tree, likely tracing the path the electricity took as it traveled through you. It's not uncommon for the blast to rupture your eardrums, possibly leading to hearing loss. And, of course, you can expect a whole world of pain. One victim recalled it as " the pain of a thousand wasps stinging from within ." In the wake of a lightning strike Immediately after being struck, the disruption the lightning would have caused to your heart's electrical rhythm could result in cardiac arrest , one of the leading causes of death in lightning strike victims. The shock could also cause seizures or respiratory arrest. If the electric current enters your skull, it could literally cook your brain, resulting in brain damage or putting you in a coma. The strike could even cause temporary or permanent paralysis. But it doesn't end there. In the wake of a lightning attack, you might be faced with a lifetime of neurological afflictions for reasons that scientists still don't fully understand. Some scientists believe that the lightning scrambles your internal circuitry , altering the behavior of your cells. You might undergo personality changes, mood swings, and memory loss. It's also possible that you will suffer from chronic pain and constant Parkinson's-like muscle twitches. In some cases, however, a lightning strike can lead to strange super talents. In a blog post for Psychology Today, University of Miami neuroscientist Berit Brogaard writes about an incident where an orthopedic surgeon who was struck by lightning developed an urge to learn to play the piano. He began to compose music he had mysteriously started hearing in his head since the strike. After a few months he abandoned his career as a surgeon and became a classical musician. This type of phenomenon baffles scientists. One theory that Brogaard says is currently being tested is that cell death caused by being struck by lightning could cause a one-time flooding of the brain with neurotransmitters that are released from the dying neurons. This causes a rewiring of neurons, providing access to areas of the brain that were previously inaccessible. But as cool as it would be, you shouldn't count on that stray bolt of electricity turning you into a prodigy in one swift flash. The overwhelming majority of consequences of being struck by lightning are painful and debilitating, and could stay with you for the rest of your life. While your chances of being struck by lightning are low, you can stay safe by tossing aside that fishing pole or golf club when you see clouds forming and heading indoors.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: COURTESY OF EDWARD J. RUPKE Advertisement  Edward J. Rupke, senior engineer at Lightning Technologies, Inc., (LTI) in Pittsfield, Mass., provides the following explanation:  It is estimated that on average, each airplane in the U.S. commercial fleet is struck lightly by lightning more than once each year. In fact, aircraft often trigger lightning when flying through a heavily charged region of a cloud. In these instances, the lightning flash originates at the airplane and extends away in opposite directions. Although record keeping is poor, smaller business and private airplanes are thought to be struck less frequently because of their small size and because they often can avoid weather that is conducive to lightning strikes.  The last confirmed commercial plane crash in the U.S. directly attributed to lightning occurred in 1967, when lightning caused a catastrophic fuel tank explosion. Since then, much has been learned about how lightning can affect airplanes. As a result, protection techniques have improved. Today, airplanes receive a rigorous set of lightning certification tests to verify the safety of their designs.  Although passengers and crew may see a flash and hear a loud noise if lightning strikes their plane, nothing serious should happen because of the careful lightning protection engineered into the aircraft and its sensitive components. Initially, the lightning will attach to an extremity such as the nose or wing tip. The airplane then flies through the lightning flash, which reattaches itself to the fuselage at other locations while the airplane is in the electric "circuit" between the cloud regions of opposite polarity. The current will travel through the conductive exterior skin and structures of the aircraft and exit off some other extremity, such as the tail. Pilots occasionally report temporary flickering of lights or short-lived interference with instruments.  Most aircraft skins consist primarily of aluminum, which conducts electricity very well. By making sure that no gaps exist in this conductive path, the engineer can assure that most of the lightning current will remain on the exterior of the aircraft. Some modern aircraft are made of advanced composite materials, which by themselves are significantly less conductive than aluminum. In this case, the composites contain an embedded layer of conductive fibers or screens designed to carry lightning currents.  Modern passenger jets have miles of wires and dozens of computers and other instruments that control everything from the engines to the passengers' headsets. These computers, like all computers, are sometimes susceptible to upset from power surges. So, in addition to safeguarding the aircraft's exterior, the lightning protection engineer must make sure that no damaging surges or transients can reach the sensitive equipment inside the aircraft. Lightning traveling on the exterior skin of an aircraft has the potential to induce transients into wires or equipment beneath the skin. These transients are called lightning indirect effects. Careful shielding, grounding and the application of surge suppression devices avert problems caused by indirect effects in cables and equipment when necessary. Every circuit and piece of equipment that is critical or essential to the safe flight and landing of an aircraft must be verified by the manufacturers to be protected against lightning in accordance with regulations set by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or a similar authority in the country of the aircraft's origin.  The other main area of concern is the fuel system, where even a tiny spark could be disastrous. Engineers thus take extreme precautions to ensure that lightning currents cannot cause sparks in any portion of an aircraft's fuel system. The aircraft skin around the fuel tanks must be thick enough to withstand a burn through. All of the structural joints and fasteners must be tightly designed to prevent sparks, because lightning current passes from one section to another. Access doors, fuel filler caps and any vents must be designed and tested to withstand lightning. All the pipes and fuel lines that carry fuel to the engines, and the engines themselves, must be protected against lightning. In addition, new fuels that produce less explosive vapors are now widely used. The aircraft's radome¿the nose cone that contains radar and other flight instruments¿is another area to which lightning protection engineers pay special attention. In order to function, radar cannot be contained within a conductive enclosure. Instead, lightning diverter strips applied along the outer surface of the radome protect this area. These strips can consist of solid metal bars or a series of closely spaced buttons of conductive material affixed to a plastic strip that is bonded adhesively to the radome. In many ways, diverter strips function like a lightning rod on a building.  Private general aviation planes should avoid flying through or near thunderstorms. The severe turbulence found in storm cells alone should make the pilot of a small plane very wary. The FAA has a separate set of regulations governing the lightning protection of private aircraft that do not transport passengers. A basic level of protection is provided for the airframe, fuel system and engines. Traditionally, most small, commercially made aircraft have aluminum skins and do not contain computerized engine and flight controls, and they are thus inherently less susceptible to lightning; however, numerous reports of noncatastrophic damage to wing tips, propellers and navigation lights have been recorded.  The growing class of kit-built composite aircraft also raises some concerns. Because the FAA considers owner-assembled, kit-built aircraft "experimental," they are not subject to lightning protection regulations. Many kit-built planes are made of fiberglass or graphite-reinforced composites. At LTI we routinely test protected fiberglass and composite panels with simulated lightning currents. The results of these tests show that lightning can damage inadequately protected composites. Pilots of unprotected fiberglass or composite aircraft should not fly anywhere near a lightning storm or in other types of clouds, because nonthunderstorm clouds may contain sufficient electric charge to produce lightning.

That talking on the telephone is the leading cause of lightning injuries inside the home? That standing under a tall tree is one of the most dangerous places to take shelter? And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

By DAN ROBINSON Storm Chaser/Photographer                   Tweet                If you know your house has just been hit directly by lightning, call the fire department . It is common for lightning to start fires in the attic and within walls of homes.  These fires inside enclosed spaces may not be visible in their beginning stages.   A cloud-to-ground lightning bolt's main objective is to find the path of least resistance from the cloud to deep into the ground.   Most houses are filled with many potential routes for lightning to follow in its journey.   This can include gas and water pipes, electric lines, phone lines, cable TV/internet lines, gutters, downspouts, metal window frames - anything conductive in a house is 'fair game' for the lightning to follow.   Lightning doesn't need conductive objects to reach ground, however - it's just forged its way through miles of air, so conductive objects in a house are a mere 'convenience' that it will use if they are available. AT RIGHT: Lightning strikes a tree and house in Charleston, West Virginia in 1998.  Lightning passing through a house will often 'branch' and utilize more than one path to ground at a time.   It can also jump through the air from one conductive path to another in what is called a side flash .  For example, lightning may first connect to electric lines in the attic of a house, then jump to better-grounded water pipes on the first or second floor.  Lightning can connect to gutters, then jump to a window frame as a 'stepping stone' to the electrical system or water pipes.  All or part of bolts have been seen jumping from wall outlets to sink faucets and even across rooms!  Animation showing possible lightning paths to ground inside of a house  Lightning current will produce significant damage to a house that is not equipped with a good protection system .  Professionally-installed lightning protection systems are expensive and the risk of a direct strike is low, so most homes do not have them. Lightning presents three main hazards to a house that is hit directly:   Fire danger :  The biggest danger lightning poses to a house is fire .  Wood and other flammable building materials can easily be ignited anywhere an exposed lightning channel comes in contact with (or passes through) them.  It is most common for lightning to start a fire in the attic or roof of a house, as the channel usually has to pass through some of the structural material in the roof before it can reach a more conductive path such as wiring or pipes.  When lightning current travels through wires, it will commonly burn them up - presenting a fire ingition hazard anywhere along the affected circuits.   Power surge damage : If lightning chooses any of the home's electrical wiring as its primary or secondary path, the explosive surge can damage even non-electronic appliances that are connected.  Even if most of the lightning current takes other paths to ground, the home's electrical system will experience enough of a surge to cause potentially significant damage to anything connected to it, electronics in particular.   Shock wave damage : Another major source of damage from lightning is produced from the explosive shock wave .  The shock waves that lightning create is what produces the thunder that we hear, and at close range, these waves can be destructive.  Lightning can easily fracture concrete, brick, cinderblock and stone.   Brick and stone chimneys are commonly damaged severely by lightning.   Lightning's shock waves can blow out plaster walls, shatter glass, create trenches in soil and crack foundations.  Shrapnel is a common secondary damage effect, with objects sometimes found embedded in walls! What about a structure that has no wiring or pipes?  It is rare for a house to be devoid of electrically conductive paths to ground, but they do exist - such as camping/fishing cabins.  In that case, all bets are off on how the lightning will choose to reach the ground.   Again, the lightning has just jumped across miles of non-conductive air, so the lack of wires or pipes won't stop it from passing through a completely non-conductive structure.   Such a structure does not provide a person with good lightning protection - so if you are caught in one during a storm, consider moving into a hard-topped automobile which provides a much better degree of safety.  This web site is made possible by support from CIS Internet .  What can you do to stay safe from lightning while inside of your house?  Since we know the common paths lightning can follow in a house (wiring and pipes), the best thing to do is stay away from those paths as best as possible during a storm.  Direct contact with them should be avoided.  This includes taking a shower or bath, washing hands, doing dishes, typing on a computer, playing video games and using a wired phone, tool or appliance.  Metal-framed windows should be avoided.  Wireless devices are safe to use (cell phones, cordless phones, remotes, etc). Direct skin contact with earth ground should also be avoided, as lightning current can travel through soil and across wet/damp concrete.  Wear shoes if walking in a basement, garage or patio.  What to do if lightning strikes your house  If your home is hit directly by lightning, your immediate concern should be for any fires that may have been ignited. Call the fire department! Again, the most common place for lightning-caused fires in a home is in the attic, but they can start anywhere the lightning has traveled.  Some fires inside the walls and attic may not be immediately apparent and not easily accessible.   You should also watch for falling debris from damaged chimneys, shingles or walls. You should also strongly consider contacting an electrician to have your home's electrical system inspected for any damage that might present a future fire hazard.  Can you get struck by lightning inside of a house?  While it is rare, yes, it is possible to receive a lightning injury inside a house.  Burns and electric shock injuries can occur when someone is in direct contact with one of lightning's chosen paths to ground.   The most common indoor lightning injuries involve a person talking on a corded phone or resting on/looking out of a metal-framed window.  "Side flashes" (discussed above) that jump across rooms can also cause injuries, but are very rare.  Indirect shrapnel-related injuries from building materials have also been documented.  How to protect sensitive electronics from a strike  It is nearly impossible to provide 100% protection to sensitive electronics from a direct lightning strike.  The best thing to do is to unplug any high-value item you wish to protect during storms, as surge protectors and UPS units can't provide direct-strike protection.   Some could argue that the risk of a direct strike to any given house is too low to justify unplugging everything for every storm that passes overhead.  It's wise to make sure your homeowner's or renter's insurance covers lightning damage.  Your insured expensive electronics can be replaced, after all.   However, consider irreplaceables such as the data saved on your computer (photos, videos, work files, etc).  You can mitigate that risk by performing frequent offsite backups and/or storing data on an external hard drive that you can unplug when needed.  Should I have a lightning protection system installed?  Animation showing how a lightning protection system works   A professionally-installed and well-grounded lightning protection system will reduce or eliminate the fire and injury hazards if your house happens to be struck directly.  You will want to assess the risk of a strike and weigh the costs versus benefits.  Insurance may be a more cost-effective option, especially if you live in an area of average to below-average thunderstorm frequency.   If you are located in a zone if frequent lightning activity (such as Florida and the Gulf Coast regions of the USA), a protection system may offer more of a benefit.

Lightning is a major cause of storm related                         deaths in  the                         U.S.                         A lightning strike can result                         in a cardiac arrest (heart stopping) at the time of the                         injury, although some victims may appear to have a delayed                         death a few days later if they are resuscitated but have                         suffered irreversible brain damage.  According to the NWS Storm Data , over the last    30 years (1987-2016)   the U.S. has averaged 47 reported lightning fatalities per year.  Only about 10% of people who are struck by lightning    are  killed, leaving 90% with various degrees of disability.  More recently, in the last 10 years (2007-2016), the U.S. has averaged 30 lightning fatalities.

Apparently, the chances are 300,000 to one, according to David Hand in his new book: The Improbability Principle. But while 300,000 to one looks like a minor risk for an individual, there are lots of people on the planet.  Small Data  A series on curious numbers cropping up in the news, by stats watcher Anthony Reuben  As a result, about 24,000 people are killed by lightning each year. Remember, you don't have to be struck by lightning to be killed by it - you could be in a house that's struck by lightning and burns down with you inside. Indeed, with seven billion people on the planet, what would be really, really unlikely would be that nobody was killed by lightning. Of course, 300,000 to one is an average - people in the developing world who spend less time indoors and have fewer tall buildings and more flammable ones are much more likely to be killed by lightning than people in developed ones. On average, three people are killed each year by lightning in the UK, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which are odds 66 times shorter than the global average. Hand's book sets out to explain why things that are considered to be very unlikely keep on happening. It's not just that people win the lottery. Again, while that's unlikely for an individual, it's pretty likely that someone will win it each week. No, we're talking about really unlikely things, like the lottery drawing the same numbers in two consecutive weeks, as happened on the Bulgarian Lottery in 2009. So, if you wait around long enough, it looks like you'll get to see almost anything happen. But not a man being struck by lightning twice in succession, seen on a security camera. The video of that, which Hand showed as part of a talk to the Royal Statistical Society on Thursday, is widely described on the internet as having been a fake. Maybe we'll have to wait a bit longer to see that.

Click here to get 30 days free!      We’ve all heard the reality check before: “You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery.”  To most of us, the odds of being struck by lightning, “ 1 in a million ,” are a convenient measuring rod for all things unlikely. Whether it’s winning the lottery or dying in a plane crash, if something is less likely to happen to you than being struck by lightning, then, as the logic goes, it’s probably not worth holding your breath for or worrying about very much (discussions along these very lines can be found here and here ).    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT       Lightning Odds…Not So Simple…  The odds of being struck by lightning, however, are not as simple as we would have them to be. The answer to the question, “What are the odds of being struck by lightning?” is actually, “It depends.”    The Numbers Behind '1 in a Million' That the odds of being struck by lightning are approximately 1 in a million is perhaps one of the most well-known statistics out there. This statistic is nonetheless, an average of the odds of being struck by lightning in the United States. According to the U.S. National Weather Service, this statistic is based on averages of reported lightning deaths and injuries along a U.S. population estimate: Estimated U.S. population as of 2011: 310,000,000 Average Annual Reported U.S. Lightning Deaths and Injures, 2001-2010: 280 Odds of being struck by lightning in a given year  (reported deaths + injuries) =1 in (310,000,000/280) = 1 in 1,107,143 =  Approximately 1 in a million  What’s particularly noteworthy is that depending on which state you’re in within the United States, your odds of being struck by lightning this year can be much higher or much lower than that 1 in a million figure mentioned above. For example, based on lightning data (courtesy StruckByLightning.org ) and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for 2011 presented in the map below, if you live in Montana, your odds of being struck by lightning are roughly 1 in 249,550, considerably higher than the the national average of 1 in a million. Towards the other end of the spectrum, in California, your odds of being struck by lightning are far lower at 1 in 7,538,382.  Lightning Map The Odds of Being Struck By Lightning, By State Click on this map to see the odds of being struck by lightning in your state (based on 2011 lightning data).  Clearly, the odds of being struck by lightning are not the same for everyone, everywhere, but why?  We face varying odds of being struck by lightning because of a few key factors. These essentially location-specific factors include: Cloud-to-ground lightning density rates, population size, indoor vs. outdoor activity setting and safety adherence. Now Available on Amazon  Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities by Jeffrey Rosenthal From terrorist attacks to big money jackpots, Struck by Lightning  deconstructs the odds and oddities of chance, examining both the relevant and irreverent role of randomness in our everyday lives..airplanes crash, bridges collapse, and we never know if we’ll be that one in a million statistic. A basic understanding of the rules of probability theory, applied to real-life circumstances, can help us to make sense of these situations, to avoid unnecessary fear, to seize the opportunities that randomness presents to us, and to actually enjoy the uncertainties we face. In this entertaining yet sophisticated look at the world of probabilities, author Jeffrey Rosenthal–an improbably talented math professor–explains the mechanics of randomness and teaches us how to develop an informed perspective on probability. U.S. Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Density This Vaisala National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) map shows the average annual lightning flash density within the continental U.S. from 1997-2011. In terms of cloud-to-ground lightning averages, Florida ranks highest, with an average of 1,414,284 flashes per year (24.7 flashes per square mile). Historically, Florida has also experienced the highest lightning number of lightning deaths in the United States, with 425 deaths occurring there from 1950-2003. Washington has the lowest cloud-to-ground lightning averages, 20,510 flashes per year (0.3 flashes per square mile). Population State population plays in a key role in determining your odds of being struck by lightning. Florida tops all the states both in terms of cloud-to-ground lightning density and the number of lightning casualties reported annually (31 in 2011), but because of Florida’s population size, an estimated 19,057,542 for 2011, the odds of being struck by lightning there were 1 in 614,759. These odds are lower  than Montana’s 1 in 249,550, even though Montana had only 4 lightning casualties, because in comparison, Montana’s estimated 2011 population was much smaller: 998,199. Indoor vs. Outdoor Simply put, more time spent outdoors increases the odds of being struck by lightning. In places where people work and engage in more activities outdoors, the odds of being struck by lightning tend to be higher. Lightning Fatalities: What Are the Odds of Being Killed by Lightning? According to U.S. NWS Storm Data for the 30 year period spanning the years 1984-2013, about 10% of people, or 1 in 10, struck by lightning are killed  . A recent report, A Detailed Analysis of Lightning Deaths in the United States from 2006 through 2013 , by lightning safety specialist, John S. Jensenius, Jr. at the National Weather Service, NOAA, revealed the following insights into lightning deaths:    Males accounted for 81% of lightning fatalities.  More than 70% of lightning deaths occurred in the months of June, July and August.  Slightly more lightning deaths happened on Saturdays and Sundays than other days of the week.  Individuals in the age range of 10-60 comprised the greatest number of lightning fatalities, with the 20-29 age bracket having the highest concentration of lightning fatalities.  64% of lightning deaths were related to leisure activities, followed by 17% of lightning deaths related to daily routine and 15% related to work.   Did You Know? As discussed in a USA Today article by Doyle Rice, there has been an overall decline in lightning fatalities in the U.S. since 1940, largely due to the impact of public education efforts and increased public recognition of the value of following safety principles.  Lightning Safety The U.S. National Weather Service cautions that when there is a thunderstorm in the area, no place outside that is safe. Moreover, if you can hear thunder, that means that lightning is, in fact, close enough to strike you . If you are outdoors when you hear thunder, seek safe shelter. In short, when it comes to lightning, the message that lightning experts and organizations regard as being the most crucial is to go indoors when there is a thunderstorm in the area. Thus, the National Weather Service , StruckByLighting.org and others have worked hard to get the simple message out: “ When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors!” Featured Image Credit: Brilhasti1/Flickr     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Email Print    Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

My room is really hot right now and I want to sit outside for a bit in the rain where it's cool.  But there's a LOT of lightning and http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/outdoors.htm says to always get inside in a lightning storm when possible.  What are my actual probabilities of being struck if I sit outside in a lightning storm.  Should I really worry about it?    prevention  weather  lightning     share | improve this question      edited Jul 12 '12 at 13:48       Eyal   2,084 1 14 37        asked Jul 12 '12 at 8:26       dspyz   190 1 4                  I wouldn't bother, but I had the same question last night.  I don't know how long these alternating hot days followed by 2 AM lightning storms are going to continue. – dspyz  Jul 12 '12 at 8:29        1      xkcd.com/795 – gerrit  Jul 14 '12 at 19:27        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  13  down vote  accepted      Here's a lot more advice than you aked for:  Around 24000 people in the entire world are struck by lightning each year. Supposing you live to be 85, that's 2 million people in your lifetime. On 7 billion people alive today, that's a lifetime chance of 1 in 3500 -- your chances are pretty slim anyway :)  But, to be more elaborate: your chances of being struck depend entirely on your surroundings. As you indicated, you're going to be near your house, which is of course much higher than your body height, and thus closer to any lightning cloud, and thus a much more likely target for lightning to strike. Provided you have a lightning rod (or similar) installed, the rod is the most direct way for a bolt to go into the ground, and will therefore considerably decrease your chances of being struck (NOT reduce it to zero though -- lightning is pretty predictable, until it's not).  There are a few caveats here -- if you do not have a lightning rod, your house is all wet from the rain, and you're touching a doorknob or standing near a pillar or something, a bolt may choose to use your body as a "least resistance" path to the ground (although water lines or power lines inside your wall still form a much more likely candidate). When a storm is directly overhead, alway open doors, windows, etc. with your right hand, while standing on your right leg -- this reduces the chances of the current moving through your heart in the (unlikely) event you are struck this way.  Also, if the bolt is conducted into the ground by a rod (or a tree or power line or similar), and you're standing near the point of entry, there may be secondary effects that can harm you (indirect impact). These are on average much less severe than a direct hit, but are known to have been lethal in some cases.  If you're NOT going to be near your house, make sure you're going to stand near tall things ( NEAR , not under). Be sure to stay well out of the region where the tall thing might reach you should it be struck, break and fall.  Suppose worst comes to worst: you find yourself in the middle of a severe thunderstorm in an open field. In that case -- if you can find a (few) long stick(s), or have one of those tents supported by fiberglass sticks with you, stick them in the ground, straight up, in a large circular pattern, before the storm is directly overhead. If there is no time, just skip it! Then (in the center of the circle) make yourself as small as you possibly can, while also making as little contact with the ground as possible. That is, crouch down, keep your head low between your knees, standing on the balls of your feet, keep your feet close together, and start praying. Stay that way until the worst of the storm has passed. Don't even look up until you are sure that the average time between lightning and thunder is at least a second.  But the very best thing you can do is of course avoid these situations all together. Inside your house, or a cafeteria, motel, pub, any place inside you can find, is the safest place to be. Inside a car is also perfectly safe due to it being an effective Farraday cage. Really anything you can find, a bus stop, stable, a cave (if you're in the mountains, God forbid), hunter's cabin, anything.  This is what I always got as advice from guides I met on hiking trips. I always stuck to it, but actually, I never verified any of it :) (aside from the odd documentary on TV).     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 12 '12 at 9:40       Rody Oldenhuis   556 6 8                  Great first post, +1! – berry120  Jul 12 '12 at 11:18            My dad would always take us to a mostly open field so we could enjoy the lightening storm better.  Of course, these were the wimpy Oregon lightening storms, not like the serious ones you get in the middle of the continent. – thursdaysgeek  Jul 17 '12 at 21:04            Being in an open field by itself isn't a guarantee to get struck, but being in an open field on top of a hill holding a long metal rod with the storm overhead kinda improves those chances :p – Rody Oldenhuis  Jul 24 '12 at 9:11        add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Related Articles   How to Protect Electrical Appliances From Lightning Strikes   How to Kill a Tree Trunk   How to Cut Down a Tall Tree   Lightning Protection for Trees      In less than a microsecond a lightning discharge can generate upwards of 200,000 amps of electricity. This bolt of energy has neither rhyme nor reason to where it hits. It can strike directly beneath the cloud that generates it or stretch 18 miles away. To prevent this capricious element of nature from hitting your home is not always possible, but protecting your house is.       How Lightning Works  The National Weather Service maintains that the mechanism of lightning creation is still unknown. One of the most accepted theories is the separation of electrical fields within the cloud. The cloud develops a positive charge in its top half and a negative charge in its lower half. A positive charge also develops on the ground below. Ice particles must also be present for lightning formation. The positive ions on the ground tend to climb up tall objects, such as telephone poles, trees and houses or collect in open areas, such as baseball fields and meadows. An invisible channel of negative ions from the cloud, called a step leader, reaches down to the positive ground ions as they reach up. When they connect, lightning occurs.   Areas of High and Low Lightning Activity  San Francisco is fortunate to be in one of the areas least hit by lightning strikes. According to the National Severe Storms Laboratory, San Francisco and most of the Pacific west coast receive the least amount of lightning flashes in the United States. The highest concentration of lightning occurs in Florida. However, terrain does play a part in where lightning strikes. Your house has a greater chance of being hit on a hilltop than on a hillside. That can be relevant in San Francisco.     Protecting Your Home's Exterior  Lightning rods will not keep lightning from striking but will help direct it safely away from your home if properly installed. Ensure lightning rods are attached to your house’s roof securely and embedded in the ground by a cable. Lightning also tends to travel across the ground, so if you’re considering planting trees in your yard, keep the taller ones at a safe distance from your house. You may want to invest in a lightning system installed by a professional company that takes your entire house, surrounding structures and landscaping into consideration when grounding for lightning strikes.   Protecting the Interior  Lightning can damage the electronics, telephone and other systems in your house connected to an electrical outlet. The easiest way to protect your appliances is to unplug them when you first hear the clap of thunder. Surge protectors can help but are not fail-proof if the strike is a powerful one. To protect family members, stay away from all plumbing including toilets, sinks and faucets as the pipes of your house make excellent conductors. Stay off the phone as well. According to the National Weather Service, 4 percent to 5 percent of people struck by lightning were talking on their corded phones.
