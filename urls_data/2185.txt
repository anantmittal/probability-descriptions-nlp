  of the week if there are 3 people in the room?   I'm wondering if my solution is accurate, as my answer was different than the solution I found:  Probability that there are at least 2 people in the room born on the same day = 1 - (No one was born on the same day) - (Exactly one person was born on the same day)  There are (3 choose 2) different pairs of couples. Each couple has the same birthday as another couple with the chances of 1/7 and different with chances 6/7. Thus:  $$1 – (6/7)^3 – 3(1/7)(6/7)^2 = 0.0553$$  Thanks for any help!    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked May 6 '12 at 7:53       Matt   1,226 4 21 36                  Intuitively, $$P=\frac1{7^3}\left[\binom71\binom32\binom61+\binom71\right]=0.388$$ – Dawei  May 6 '12 at 7:58         add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  5  down vote  accepted      Label the three people $A,B$, and $C$. Suppose that no two were born on the same day of the week. $A$ can be born on any day of the week. The probability that $B$ was born on a different day is $\frac67$. (We are of course assuming that the seven days are equally likely, though I believe that in fact this isn't the case.) Given that $A$ and $B$ were born on different days of the week, the probability that $C$ was born on one of the remaining $5$ days of the week is $\frac57$. Thus, the probability that they were born on three different days of the week is $\frac67\cdot\frac57=\frac{30}{49}$, and the probability that at least two of them were born on the same day of the week is $1-\frac{30}{49}=\frac{19}{49}$.  You can check this as follows. There are $7^3=343$ possible ways of assigning days of the week to $A,B$, and $C$. $7\cdot6\cdot5=210$ of these result in $A,B$, and $C$ being assigned different days of the week, so the remaining $343-210=133$ assignments give at least two of the three people the same day of the week. Since all assignments are (assumed to be) equally likely, the probability of getting one of those is $\frac{133}{343}=\frac{19}{49}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 6 '12 at 8:00       Brian M.

Look at the ordered triple $d_1,d_2,d_3$ of days on which $A,B,C$ were born respectively. You have $7^3$ such triples. Now, count the "good" triples. i.e triples in which at least two guys have birthday on the same day: 1) exactly two people have birthday on the same day: choose two days of the week: $\frac{7!}{5!}=42$ (ordered) and choose the two guys that were born on the first day: $\binom{3}{2}=3$. Total of $3\cdot 42=126$ triples. 2) all the guys were born on the same day: choose the day: 7 options. So you got $126+7=133$ good triples out of $7^3$. So the probability is $\frac{133}{7^3}\sim0.39$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 6 '12 at 8:46             answered May 6 '12 at 8:06       Dennis Gulko   13.7k 1 24 51                  Edited. apparently $6\cdot7=42$ and not $21$ :-) – Dennis Gulko  May 6 '12 at 8:47        add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Given that Mrs. Grundy's older child was born on a Monday, what is the probability that both her children were born on Mondays?  Assume that each child was equally likely to be born on any day of the week, and that the two birthdays are independent.   The obvious answer would be $\frac{1}{7}$ since the second child is equal likely to be born on any day of the week.  But I got this problem out of a high-level math book and that would be too easy.  Is $\frac{1}{7}$ the answer?  Or am I missing something really big here?  UPDATE: $\frac{1}{7}$ was the answer and I was correct.  And no, this is not a duplicate.  The other problem has a different part, so whoever marked this question a duplicate was not careful enough to read the whole question.    probability  combinatorics  conditional-expectation     share | cite | improve this question      edited Oct 3 '16 at 0:21             asked Oct 2 '16 at 15:27       Yuna Kun   620 1 11                  Why can't it be $\frac 17$? – suomynonA  Oct 2 '16 at 15:33            For your next questions, please turn to more informative titles, possibly taking as an example the modified version of this one. – Did  Oct 2 '16 at 15:38            @suomynonA  I'm not sure if it is the answer, I'm asking for reassurance. – Yuna Kun  Oct 2 '16 at 15:38         1      Possible duplicate of Mrs. Grundy's Conditional Probability Problem .

Here we are asked for the probability given the older child , rather than given at least one child .  However, the two questions are very likely to come from the same problem set.  If so, then the point of the exercise is to recognise the distinction. – Graham Kemp  Oct 2 '16 at 16:16         |  show 1 more comment          3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote  accepted      The obvious answer is the right one.  To see this formally, let $Y$ be the event that the younger child was born on Monday. Let $O$ be the event that the older child was born on Monday. We are interested in the probability of $Y \cap O$, that both children were born on Monday, given $O$. Using the definition of conditional probability and independence we have  $$P(Y \cap O \mid O) = \frac{P(Y \cap O)}{P(O)} = \frac{P(Y)P(O)}{P(O)} = P(Y) = 1/7$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 2 '16 at 15:54             answered Oct 2 '16 at 15:48       aduh   3,348 2 10 33              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      If the older child is born on a monday, this means Mrs. Grundy lived for, lets say, X days after that monday.  If the X is an exact multiplication of 7, this means Mrs. Grundy lived same amount of each day (x/7 mondays, x/7 sundays etc.) to have second child. Then the answer is 1/7.  However, if X is not an exact multiplication of 7, this means Mrs. Grundy did not have her days in equal amounts, so that the answer is not 1/7.  Lets calculate the probability for each day and combine them,  $ \dfrac{1}{7}\dfrac{X/7}{X} + \dfrac{6}{7} \dfrac{floor(X/7)}{X}  $  Equation above means that its 1/7 chance for Mrs. Grundy to start having kids, in that case, probability is 1/7, but for other 6 days, it is less than 1/7. 'floor' means round down, it will give the amount of monday's in Mrs. Grundy's life before giving birth to older child.  We also know that floor(x/7)=x/7 if x is exact multiplication of 7. So the answer is,  $ \dfrac{floor(X/7)}{X} $  which means the exact probability depends on how many days Mrs. Grundy had after the first child. It's maximum is 1/7 and minimum is 1/13.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 2 '16 at 16:00       VolkanOzcan   152 5              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The answer to this depends how you want to interpret the question. The most basic answer would be $\frac{1}{7}$ and this assumes that the birth of the $2$ children are independent (i.e they don't rely on each other). If you want to be a bit more accurate, you can consider the cases that Mrs Grundy has twins. This would mean (unless we're being really pedantic) that the $2$ children will be born on the same day of the week. This would mean that the days on which her children are born are not independent. According to google roughly $3$% of births result in twins. Let  $A = \{\text{Event Mrs G has twins and they're both born on a Monday}\}$, $B = \{\text{Event Mrs G does not have twins and they're both born on a Monday}\}$ and $C = \{\text{Event Mrs G has at least one child born on a Monday}\}$.  Hence if we take this into account we get the probability $P$ that Mrs G has $2$ children born on a Monday to be
\begin{align*}
P &= \mathbb{P}((A \cup B)|C)\\
&=\mathbb{P}(A|C)+\mathbb{P}(B|C)\\
&=\frac{\mathbb{P}(A\cap C)}{\mathbb{P}(C)} + \frac{\mathbb{P}(B\cap C)}{\mathbb{P}(C)}\\
&=\frac{\frac{3}{100}\cdot\frac{1}{7}}{1-((\frac{3}{100}\cdot \frac{6}{7})+(\frac{97}{100}\cdot(\frac{6}{7})^2)} + \frac{\frac{97}{100} \cdot (\frac{1}{7})^2}{1-((\frac{3}{100}\cdot \frac{6}{7})+(\frac{97}{100}\cdot(\frac{6}{7})^2)}\\
&=\frac{59}{641}
\end{align*}
Note I used independence of $A$ and $B$ in the second equality.

[duplicate]         up vote  9  down vote  favorite  5       This question already has an answer here:    Boy Born on a Tuesday - is it just a language trick?  9 answers     I've most recently read about the Tuesday Boy Problem via twitter and I, as probably most other people, was sure that the probability has to be 1/2. After having read through a lot of solutions which were not identical at all, I've come to the conclusion that $P = \frac{13}{27}$ sounds the most reasonable. The corresponding argument was as follows:  Say the older child is the boy born on Tuesday. Then, if the younger child is female, there are seven possibilities and analogous if the younger child is male. In case the younger child is the boy born on Tuesday, for an older daughter, again there are seven possibilities, but for an older son, there are only six, because the case that the older son was born on Tuesday has already been counted. Thus,  $$P = \frac{6+7}{6+7+7+7} = \frac{13}{27}. $$  My first question is: Is this the correct solution? I've found other websites giving different solutions, however I could never agree with any of those.  In case this is the correct solution: Why does the probability change when the father specifies the birthday of a son? (does it actually change? A lot of answers/posts stated that the statement does matter) What I mean is: It is clear that (in case he has a son) his son is born on some day of the week. I could replace Tuesday with any day of the week and the probability would be the same. Say the father would have stated:   I have two children. (At least) One of them is a son.   Then, without loss of generality, we could say that this son is born on a Tuesday and again we would have $P = \frac{13}{27}$. But looking at an equivalent (?) problem, we get a completely different probability: Let's toss two coins consecutively and say heads is equivalent to "son" and tails to "daughter". Then, if we know that we tossed at least one heads, if it was the first tossed coin, the probability for another heads is 1/2. If the second coin was heads, then we can only take the case in account where the first coin was tails. So the probability for two heads is $P = \frac{1}{3}$.  So my second (actually third) question is: Where did I go wrong?  Lastly I want to ask (as my knowledge in probability/statistics is limited to what I have been taught in high school) whether the argument which gives $P=\frac{13}{27}$ for the original Tuesday Birthday Problem already takes the possibility of twins in consideration. Can it be regarded as a special case of two boys both born on Tuesday (I ask because in every argument leading to this probability there was a distinction between older child = boy vs. younger child = boy)?

Specifically, it depends on what the speaker would say if he had a different set of children. Look at the three scenarios provided by Tanya Khovanova: in one of them the correct answer is $1/2$, in another it’s $1/3$, and in the third it’s $13/27$. In particular, if you assume that the speaker was randomly chosen from the pool of all men who could honestly say ‘I have two children, and one is a son born on a Tuesday’, $13/27$ is the right answer.  If the man says simply ‘I have two children, at least one of whom is a son’, the probability that the other child is a boy again depends on the sample space $-$ on the assumptions made about how the speaker was chosen. If he was chosen at random from the pool of all men who could honestly say ‘I have two children, and one is a son born on a Tuesday’, but simply made the weaker statement ‘I have two children, at least one of whom is a son’, the correct answer is $13/27$, as before. If, however, he was chosen at random from the pool of all men who could honestly say ‘I have two children, at least one of whom is a son’, the correct answer is $1/3$. And if he was picked at random from the pool of all fathers of two children and told you the sex of one of his children picked at random, then the correct answer is $1/2$. (These are, in reverse order, Tanya Khovanova’s three scenarios, modified for the revised statement by the father.)  These are bad puzzles, in the sense that they can’t be answered without making assumptions that go beyond what’s actually stated in the problem. Thus, there really is no single right answer. Rather, there are several answers that are right for different background assumptions.  For your final question, note that even with twins you normally have an elder and a younger child, even if it’s only by a very small time interval, so the elder/younger argument still works (in the settings in which it’s the appropriate interpretation).     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 1 '11 at 17:54       Brian M.

So let's say we always knew the father has two children, and he made the statement "One is a son born on a Tuesday".  Now assume we gave the man a list with the 14 statements "one is a son born on a monday", "one is a son born on a tuesday", ..., "one is a girl born on a saturday", "one is a girl born on a sunday". And we asked him to read the first statement on the list that is true. Or the last statement on the list that is true. Or pick random statements from the list until he finds a true one, and read that.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 29 '14 at 14:45       gnasher729   5,753 9 28              add a comment |       Not the answer you're looking for?

One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?   The claim was that it is not actually a mathematical problem and it is only a language problem.   If one wanted to restate this problem formally the obvious way would be like so:  Definition : Sex is defined as an element of the set $\\{\text{boy},\text{girl}\\}$.  Definition : Birthday is defined as an element of the set $\\{\text{Monday},\text{Tuesday},\text{Wednesday},\text{Thursday},\text{Friday},\text{Saturday},\text{Sunday}\\}$  Definition : A Child is defined to be an ordered pair: (sex $\times$ birthday).  Let $(x,y)$ be a pair of children,  Define an auxiliary predicate $H(s,b) :\\!\\!\iff s = \text{boy} \text{ and } b = \text{Tuesday}$.  Calculate $P(x \text{ is a boy and } y \text{ is a boy}|H(x) \text{ or } H(y))$  I don't see any other sensible way to formalize this question.   To actually solve this problem now requires no thought (infact it is thinking which leads us to guess incorrect answers), we just compute  $$
\begin{align*}
& P(x \text{ is a boy and } y \text{ is a boy}|H(x) \text{ or } H(y)) \\\\
=& \frac{P(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }(H(x)\text{ or }H(y)))}
        {P(H(x)\text{ or }H(y))} \\\\
=& \frac{P((x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }H(x))\text{ or }(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }H(y)))}
        {P(H(x)) + P(H(y)) - P(H(x))P(H(y))} \\\\
=& \frac{\begin{align*} &P(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }x\text{ born on Tuesday}) \\\\
   + &P(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ born on Tuesday}) \\\\
   - &P(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }x\text{ born on Tuesday and }y\text{ born on Tuesday}) \\\\
   \end{align*}}
   {P(H(x)) + P(H(y)) - P(H(x))P(H(y))} \\\\
=& \frac{1/2 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 1/7 + 1/2 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 1/7 - 1/2 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 1/7 \cdot 1/7}
        {1/2 \cdot 1/7 + 1/2 \cdot 1/7 - 1/2 \cdot 1/7 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 1/7} \\\\
=& 13/27
\end{align*}

For example, what is the strategy of the guy telling you about his family? If he always mentions a boy first and not a daughter, we get one probability; if he talks about the sex of the first born child, we get a different probability. Your calculation makes a choice in this issue - you choose the version of "if the father has a boy and a girl, he'll mention the boy".  What I'm aiming to is this: the question is not well-defined mathematically. It has several possible interpretations, and as such the "problem" here is indeed of the language; or more correctly, the fact that a simple statement in English does not convey enough information to specify the precise model for the problem.  Let's look at a simplified version without days. The probability space for the make-up of the family is {BB, GB, BG, GG} (GB means "an older girl and a small boy", etc). We want to know what is $P(BB|A)$ where A is determined by the way we interpret the statement about the boys. Now let's look at different possible interpretations.  1) If there is a boy in the family, the statement will mention him. In this case A={BB,BG,GB} and so the probability is $1/3$.  2) If there is a girl in the family, the statement will mention her. In this case, since the statement talked about a boy, there are NO girls in the family. So A={BB} and so the probability is 1.  3) The statement talks about the sex of the firstborn. In this case A={BB,BG} and so the probability is $1/2$.  The bottom line: The statement about the family looks "constant" to us, but it must be looked as a function from the random state of the family - and there are several different possible functions, from which you must choose one otherwise no probabilistic analysis of the situation will make sense.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 11 '10 at 6:39             answered Sep 11 '10 at 5:42       Gadi A   11.1k 2 50 94              6      Nope. I'm saying that in order to give a probabilistic meaning to this statement, you need to attach probabilistic assumptions to it. In your case it seems you've chosen the assumption of "if there is a boy, a boy will be given in the statement". Other possible interpretations: "If there is a girl, a girl will be said" (so since a boy was said, there are no girls 100%), and "If there is a boy and a girl, one will be said at random" and "The sex of x is said" and so on. Forget about days - try to do the probability for these cases and see what happens. – Gadi A  Sep 11 '10 at 6:11         6      This is of course correct, but you must also take into account the question of how the statement "I have a boy" comes to be. I've tried to elaborate in my answer. – Gadi A  Sep 11 '10 at 6:40        3      The statement (ignoring the day red herring) is "I have two children. One is a boy." As I said before, this statement should be considered as part of the probabilistic scenario otherwise the problem is simply not well-defined. – Gadi A  Sep 11 '10 at 7:37         5      What I meant was that adding the day does not affect the "strangeness" of the situation. However, I'm not sure if it's the strangeness that interests you. The main point is that it's called "a language problem" because different mathematical interpretations of the same English statement yield different mathematical models, and hence different mathematical results - and so for every intuition about the problem there is a interpretation in which the result is counter-intuitive. – Gadi A  Sep 11 '10 at 11:52        3      Exactly; this is why this question, in its ambiguous phrasing, would make a poor exam question. Since there are several acceptable formulations "from first principles" of this problem. – Gadi A  Sep 15 '10 at 15:45        |  show 22 more comments            up vote  17  down vote      It is actually impossible to have a unique and unambiguous answer to the puzzle without explicitly articulating a probability model for how the information on gender and birthday is generated.  The reason is that (1) for the problem to have a unique answer some random process is required, and (2) the answer is a function of which random model is used.   The problem assumes that a unique probability can be deduced as the answer. This requires that the set of children described is chosen by a random process, otherwise the number of boys is a deterministic quantity and the probability would be 0 or 1 but with no ability to determine which is the case.  More generally one can consider random processes that produce the complete set of information referenced in the problem: choose a parent, then choose what to reveal about the number, gender, and birth days of its children.  The answer depends on which random process is used.  If the Tuesday birth is disclosed only when there are two boys, the probability of two boys is 1.    If Tuesday birth is disclosed only when there is a sister, the probability of two boys is 0.  The answer could be any number between 0 or 1 depending on what process is assumed to produce the data.   There is also a linguistic question of how to interpret "one is a boy born on Tuesday".  It could mean that the number of Tuesday-born males is exactly one, or at least one child.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 13 '10 at 8:58             answered Sep 11 '10 at 8:31       T..   10.3k 2 29 46              6      +1. We have a reasonably standard jargon for specifying simple random processes in English. People come up with "puzzles" like this by exploiting the impreciseness of English for describing more complicated situations. If the person posing the question had directly stated the random process, nobody would be confused. The reason this is a "puzzle" is that it's worded too vaguely to convey the intended meaning.  So @muad: any time someone asks you a probability "puzzle", you should simply press them about exactly what random process they have in mind. Then it will be easy. – Carl Mummert  Sep 12 '10 at 12:07            What you call "a linguistic question" over what "one is a boy born on Tuesday" means is actually the observation that people are capable of misunderstanding even unambiguous language. I do not think this question is about that sort of misunderstanding, and it would be unchanged by substituting "at least one is a boy born on a Tuesday" for the above phrase.

Is atleast one of them a boy who is born on Tuesday? Dave answers Yes.  Dave has two children. I ask him to first choose and fix one child at random, and tell me if it is a boy who was born on Tuesday. Dave answers yes he is a boy born on Tuesday.   For 1st the probability (of both being boys) is 13/27, while for the second the probability is 1/2.  The way in which the question is asked, it's in line with 1st, hence the answer should be 13/27.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 5 '17 at 21:46             answered Sep 11 '10 at 8:35       KalEl   2,334 3 11 21              3      +1 for correct answer.  More specifically, your first example is equivalent to the case where Dave knows the sex/birthdate of both children, while the second example is equivalent to the case where Dave doesn't know the sex/birthdate of both children; so what we have here is yet another question about knowledge-of-knowledge.

In other words if Dave says "I have two children, and at least one of them is a boy born on a Tuesday", the information conveyed by his statement depends on the space of possible ones. (You're assuming that the information conveyed is the content of his statement: and yes, the answer to "if we are given the information that Dave has a boy born on a Tuesday..." is indeed 13/27.)

If the statement were a response to a random experiment where we ask random people if they have a boy born on Tuesday, yes, it would be in line with the 1st. That is certainly not the case here, however. – 6005  Apr 8 '17 at 21:22        2      In my brain, I have an implicit prior distribution over the possible kids someone has and whether they are male or female. Upon hearing they have 2 kids, I update on them having 2 kids. Upon hearing that one of them is a boy, I update not on the fact that at least one is a boy, but rather on the fact that a random child of theirs was a boy -- in other words, mentally, I assume WLOG they are talking about a random child when they make the statement. Thus I get that the other child is equally likely a boy or a girl.

What space does Dave's statement come from? The only way to get the 13/27 answer is to make the unjustified unreasonable assumption that Dave is boy-centric & Tuesday-centric: if he has two sons born on Tue and Sun he will mention Tue; if he has a son & daughter both born on Tue he will mention the son, etc. See [this article](arxiv.org/abs/1102.0173).

But in everyday english, from "there are two fleems, one is a glarp" we all infer that the other is not a glarp.  From "there are two fleems, one is a glarp, which is snibble" we would still infer that the other is not a glarp. Whereas from "there are two fleems, one is a glarp which is snibble" (absence of comma, or when spoken, difference in intonation) we would infer that the other is not a snibble glarp, but it could still be an unsnibble glarp.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 11 '10 at 23:58      anon                  I see what you mean, Whether one interprets "One is ..." to mean "Exactly one (and no more) is ..." or "At least one ...".

It's stated as a fact, thus the probability is 1. Also, it doesn't say " only one boy is born on a Tuesday". But indeed, this could be a language thing.  With 2 children you have the following possible combinations: 1. two girls 2. a boy and a girl 3. a girl and a boy 4. two boys  If at least 1 is a boy we only have to consider the last three combinations. That gives us one in three that both are boys. The error which is often made is to consider 2. and 3. as a single combination.  edit I find it completely counter-intuitive that the outcome is influenced by the day, and I simulated the problem for one million families with 2 kids. And lo and behold, the outcome is 12.99 in 27.

the probability of 7*P(b AND d1) = P(b AND d1) + P(b AND d2) + ... + P(b AND d7) = P((b AND d1) OR (b AND d2) OR ... OR (b AND d7)) = P(b AND (d1 OR d2 OR ... OR d7)) = P(b).  However, the flaw here is that, in reality, P(b AND d1) + P(b AND d2) + ... + P(b AND d7) is NOT equal to P((b AND d1) OR (b AND d2) OR ... OR (b AND d7)). This means that mentioning independent (and one might think irrelevant) information alongside with relevant information actually changes the resulting probabilities.  One interesting consequence: if I say something like
"I have two children. One of them is a boy who was born at 10:24 PM on February 10th,"
The probability that I have two boys is now almost exactly the same as as the probability that I have a girl and a boy. Adding a unique or almost unique piece of information makes the stuff I want to know about the other child independent of the information I have on the first child. If I took this to the extreme and said that I have a firstborn boy, won't know anything additional about the other child.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 11 '10 at 14:36       yrudoy   1,218 11 20                  What is an example of the "... is NOT equal ..."?

This allows you to restate the "probability" question as a "percentage" question, taking idealized percentages.  Consider:   Given a parent randomly selected from the pool of all parents who have two children where at least one of the children is a boy born on Tuesday, what is the probability that both children are boys?   This can be stated as a percentage question:   What percentage of (parents who have two children where at least one of the children is a boy born on Tuesday) have two boys?   By contrast, if the day was a matter of chance (not a restriction on the pool size), we get a different question:   Given a parent randomly selected from the pool of all parents who have two children at least one of whom is a boy, where after the random selection is made we shall be told the day of the week on which the boy was born (if there is only one boy) or if there are two boys we shall be told the day of the week on which a randomly chosen one of the two boys was born, what is the probability that both children are boys if the day we are told is Tuesday?   As you can see, in this setup the "Tuesday" part has absolutely no influence on the selection process, and can be entirely disregarded.  This is what is meant by Wikipedia's statement:   The moral of the story is that these probabilities do not just depend on the known information, but on how that information was obtained.    As a further note, you can't "prove" anything about the "actual" meaning by using computer simulations, because in order to program a computer simulation in the first place you must first disambiguate which scenario you are actually talking about.  So the only thing a computer simulation can "prove" is how the programmer interpreted the question.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 27 '17 at 6:10       Wildcard   2,495 6 26              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .            asked    7 years, 7 months ago      viewed     4,061 times       active    5 months ago           13 votes · comment · stats    Visit Chat      Linked     9   The Tuesday Birthday Problem - why does the probability change when the father specifies the birthday of a son?     1   The man with two boys     292   A challenge by R.

In most years, one's birthday the following year is on the subsequent day of the week, and in that pattern, my birthday next year (2012) it is on a Saturday.  However, due to 2012 being a leap year, my birthday in 2013 will be on Monday - I miss out on having a Sunday birthday.  I quite like having weekend birthdays, so that disappoints me a bit. However it leads me to a question:  Over a reasonable-length life-time, does any given person's number of weekend birthdays even out to an average, or are some people significantly more blessed than others?  If some people do have an advantage in this respect, is there any way mathematical way to work out whether being born on any given day of any given year will confer an advantage? And further, what are the probabilities of being 'lucky' in your number of weekend birthdays.  My guess is that for any given year, on each side of Feb 29th, birthdays on any given day of the week throughout the year will have the same score.  To make it a bit easier, lets say for a 'reasonable length life-time', we mean a fixed length of 80 years (though I for one intend to beat that!). That said, I would also be interested in how the maths change as we vary the life-span.    combinatorics  calendar-computations     share | cite | improve this question      edited Apr 16 '11 at 18:33       Willie Wong   53.2k 8 99 202        asked Feb 12 '11 at 20:30       Spudley   170 2 8                  This isn't really probability, since the day of the week a particular day falls on is not a random event; more combinatorics.

Consider first the situation in the Julian calendar, where there is a leap year every $4$ years without fail.  Suppose you have January 1st on a Monday, in the year immediately after a leap year. When will January 1st again fall on a Monday in the year immediately after a leap year? The pattern is:   M, T, W, R, Sa, Su, M, T, R, F, Sa, Su, T, W, R, F, Su, M, T, W, F, Sa, Su, M, W, R, F, Sa,   and then repeats; that is, a 28 year cycle. So, ignoring the leap year rule for Gregorian calendar, you could check for a period of 84 years (three full cycles).  The situation is similar if your birthday occurs March 1st or later, except that the leap year affects you in position 4 instead of 5; you would have:   M, T, W, F, Sa, Su, M, W, R, F, Sa, M, T, W, R, Sa, Su, M, T, R, F, Sa, Su, T, W, R, F, Su,   and the pattern repeats.  In our putative example, which began on a Monday, we got each day of the week exactly $4$ times; that is, they all occur equally likely. If you chop it off at 80 years, then you'd be one short on four days. Changing the day of the week, or the time of the most recent leap year, would not affect the outcome: it cycles every 28 years.  However, the Gregorian calendar has a slightly different rule for leap years: in the Gregorian calendar, a year is leap year if and only if it is a multiple of $4$ that is not a multiple of $100$, except for the multiples of $400$ (that's why $1900$ was not a leap year, $2000$ was , but $2100$ will not). For someone born before $2016$, assuming a period of $84$ years, this will not matter because we will have a cycle just as above, with leap years every four years. But if you extend the lifetime so that it includes the year $2100$, then you start running into trouble because you skip a leap year.  You can think of the Julian calendar as repeating the pattern of leap years every four years; the Gregorian calendar, on the other hand, has a cycle of 400 years for repeating leap years. Added: And as Ross pointed out, while the Julian calendar has a cycle of 28 years, the Gregorian calendar has a cycle of 400. So you want to check what happens over a period of 400 years.  Over a cycle of 400 years, the number of times a given date (other than February 29) falls on a particular day does change (it's not uniform, like in the Julian calendar). If you start counting on a Monday, over the next 400 years, that date will fall on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday 58 times each, Thursday and Friday 57 times each; and Tuesday and Sunday 56 times each. It's a pretty small difference over a period of 400 years, but there you go.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 12 '11 at 21:53             answered Feb 12 '11 at 21:34       Arturo Magidin   248k 30 550 871                  Aewesome answer.

If the date falls on a Monday after falling on Saturday due to the leap year, you would get two weekend birthdays in a row in four and five years time, and in ten and eleven years time.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 8 '17 at 22:40       user453592   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

One person is chosen at random.  What is the probability that the persons birthday is on a Monday in the year 2008. Write the answer as a decimal to two d.p.  Answer in book = 0.14    Attempt ONE   There are 52 Monday's in 1 year so I did 52/3750 = 0.014  WRONG ANSWER   Many attempts later Thinking that there are 52 Monday's in 365  days I did 52/365 = 0.14 because this is the probability of there being a Monday in 1 year. CORRECT ANSWER  BUT I'm not happy.  I just got the answer by not really knowing what I'm doing. Why did I not need to use  the 3750 people value?   What happens if the question asked about the probability of TWO people's birthday being on a Monday? Would the answer be (52/365)×(52/365) = 0.02?   Please help.

Math exercises love to include completely irrelevant information to lead you astray, so as to better prepare you for real world scenarios which are often chock-full of red herrings. For this problem, all that matters is that you pick one person at random from the company. For all intents and purposes, which day of the year a person is born on is completely random. In a more realistic exercise, you might have considered birth rates and holidays and what not to determine the "hot spots" for more births than typical, but that's not needed here...  The second method is correct because any individual person, picked at random, has a 1/365 chance of being born in any given day. Since there are 52 Mondays in 2008, that gives a 52/366 (because 2008 was a leap year) chance of that person being born on a Monday. Because of the error introduced by rounding to two decimal places, 1/7 would have also been an acceptable answer, since there's only seven possible days to choose from. 52/366 is slightly more accurate because that accounts for the fact that some weekdays appear slightly more often than others do in a given calendar year.  Your proposed answer for the scenario in which two people are picked at random is also correct. What day of the week a person is born on is an independent event. One person being born on, say, a Thursday, in no way affects the chance of the other person being born on Monday.

What are the chances? Share share tweet comment email Author: Rhett Allain Rhett Allain dot-physics 12.13.10 11:45 am You say it's your birthday. What are the chances? This weekend was graduation at Southeastern Louisiana University . Congratulations to all the recent graduates. For the opening speech, some interesting facts are listed. Who is the youngest graduate? Who is the oldest. Are there any parent and child graduating together etc... Also announced are any graduates who happen to also be having a birthday. This year there were three such students. What are the chances of this happening? First, take a student. Let me assume that any randomly picked student could have a birthday on any day of the year. So the probability of having a birthday on any particular day is: Of course this assumes it is not a leap year, it also assumes that all days have the same probability. I suspect for a given year, the distributions of births is not evenly spread over the days of the year. Think of babies that are born by inducing labor. How many doctors are going to schedule this on the weekend? So, the question to answer: what is the probability that at least one of the 1300 graduates has a birthday on graduation day? Well, that would be 1 minus the probability that no one has a birthday on that day. What is the probability that a particular student does not have a birthday on graduation day? That would be 354/365. What are the chances that all 1300 graduates have this also? Using this, I can get the probability of at least one student having a birthday as: So, not such a crazy event. Another trick This birthday thing reminds me of one of my favorite tricks. Get a class of students. Surely there will be more than 13 in there. Make a wager: I bet that at least two of you have a birthday in the same month. Students might think there is a trick - and they would be correct. However, they also might think you just have a good chance of being right. You can encourage them to take the bet by saying something like "If I lose, everyone gets an A". Here is the deal. If there are 13 or more students in the class, there MUST at least be two students with the same birth month. Just think. What are the possible cases. Let's say that student 1 has a birthday in January, student two is born in February and so on. The twelve student would be born in December. What about the 13th student? This student would have to be born in some month that is already taken. Bet won. Oh, but what about the other end of the spectrum? What if every student is born in March? Well, thirteen students with the same birth month is more than 2 students with the same birth month. The problem is that it is easy to confuse this question with something like "what are the chances that two students in this class were born in July?" That has some probability that is not 100%. The question above is different. #probability Most Popular gear 4 Best Smartphones of 2018: Guide to Android, Samsung Galaxy, iPhone Author: Jeffrey Van Camp Jeffrey Van Camp gear How to Check If Cambridge Analytica Could Access Your Facebook Data Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett culture 'Far Cry 5' Review: All Games Are Illusions, But This Is Nothing More Author: Julie Muncy Julie Muncy More Stories View Comments Sponsored Stories Powered By Outbrain Brian Barrett How to Check if Cambridge Analytica Could Access Your Facebook Data Jeffrey Van Camp The 4 Best Smartphones Money Can Buy in 2018 Issie Lapowsky Most Links to Popular Sites on Twitter Come From Bots Aarian Marshall Uber Acquires the Bike-Share Company Jump Graeme McMillan Cantina Talk: The New *Star Wars* Trilogy Looks to the Past, *Solo* Looks to Denny's More dot-physics privacy Cambridge Analytica Could Also Access Facebook Messages Author: Issie Lapowsky Issie Lapowsky Math What Random Walks in Multiple Dimensions Teach You About Life Author: Rhett Allain Rhett Allain alert alert This Hacker Could Hijack Citywide Sirens to Play Any Sound Author: Andy Greenberg Andy Greenberg Genetics Helix Takes Clinical Genetic Testing Straight to Consumers Author: Megan Molteni Megan Molteni social media Mark Zuckerberg Answers to Congress For Facebook's Troubles Author: Issie Lapowsky Issie Lapowsky privacy How Healthy Is Today’s Internet for Humanity?

When the deck is full, this probability is 4/52 (the probability of getting one of 4 aces) times 16/51 (the probability of getting one of 16 kings, queens, jacks, or tens) times 2 (the number of orders in which you could get these cards: ace first, or ace second). \n. 
\nThis comes out to 32/663, or about 4.83%. \n. 
\nOf course, this probability changes as the game progresses: it decreases when any of the tens, jacks, queens, kings, or aces get discarded, but increases when other cards get discarded. This change is unpredictable, but its expected value is 0; this is a complicated concept to explain, but it means that on average, the probability will go up as much as it goes down.\n. 
\nAlso, the probability is still 32/663 at any point in the game if you have no information whatsoever about what cards came up before: if you forgot every card you saw, or if you just joined the game.               Dlmick  265,765 Contributions      What does being listed as probable mean in the NFL?  The NFL has a 'rating' system for injured players that specifies their probability of playing in a game:. 
1) Out - the player will not play   2) Doubtful - 75% chance the player will not play   3) Questionable - 50-50 chance the player will play   4) Probable - 75% chance the player WILL play            What is the probability of two healthy people where one is a carrier being parents to a child born with cystic fibrosis?  If only one person is a carrier of cystic fibrosis than there is no chance of having a child with it. Both parents have to be carriers and even then there is only a 25% chance. If only one carries than there is a 50% chance that their children will carry but will not have cystic fibrosis.

In blackjack what is the probability of being dealt three sevens?  The odds of being dealt three suited sevens in a six-deck game are approximately 63,000 to 1. [Source: Arnold Snyder, "The Big Book of Blackjack" p205]    The odds of being dealt three sevens (not suited) is somewhat worse than 500 to 1 (considering that casinos frequently offer the payout of 500 to 1 for players receiving three unsuited 7s in the "Super Sevens" side bet).

Why the probability is have a specified chance to be selected and why the non probability does not have an equal of being selected?  Probability is the number of occurrences of a specific event divided by the total number of possible events. Suppose you took a multiple choice test with 4 possible answer's A, B, C, D. Only 1 of the 4 choices is correct; so the probability of correct is 1/4 and the probability of incorrect is 3/4. Most of the time the two probabilities will not be the same.               Squirrel Man  234,785 Contributions      What is the probability of being killed by a Pop Tart?  Very low, and for a number of reasons.    If a Pop Tart were to be traveling towards your head, the Pop Tart would have to be going at least 173 mph to break your neck, subsequently being killed. Pop Tarts usually do not travel that fast.    A flying Pop Tart that came directly at any other parts would still result in a very unlikely death, since the rib cage holds the most important organs, and is thus very strong (much stronger than the human neck).    To die from choking on a Pop Tart is also extremely unlikely, because 4,600 deaths occur in the United States out of a population of 307 million people. This is only in the United States; the percentage of choking alone is bigger for the entire world. The 4,600 deaths from choking were also mostly younger kids and infants from small parts, and not from food (which makes it very unlikely for the choking culprit to be a Pop Tart).    Thus, the probability of being killed by a Pop Tart is lower than a calculable percentage due to the vast assortment of things that happen in the world. It is  way below  1%.            Probability of being divorced if your parents are divorced?  Well, my parents are divorced and I'm only 15... it was just 2 months ago...

I love my parents...but..ya know, when i heard that, i just had so many more problems in my life i just started to break down and cry. So, based on your beliefs and opinions (in my opinion) i think it pushes you more to find that one right person...

Births are not distributed randomly across the year: there are seasonal variations as well as differences between days of the week. Where maternity staff like to celebrate New Year's Eve, there may be fewer people on duty on January 1 and so there may well be fewer births. Unfortunately, comprehensive information on such variations is not available.  If you assume that each day of the year is equally likely, the probability is 1/365. Adjusting for leap years changes that to 1/365.25.

First you need to get the accident rates for the airline on which you are planning to fly. One measure is the number of crashes per million kilometres or million hours of flying.  Next, calculate the distance or number of hours you will be flying. Then one measure of the probability is the ratio of the two corresponding values.   You could refine the calculation by adjusting for the aircraft type. Also, since most crashes happen at take-off or landing, you may want to consider which airports you are flying from and to, including any that you are transiting.

Let me give you a simple answer first and two deep answers next.  Simple answer is, assuming that all months have the same number of days (which is very approximately true), 1/12.   If you want a slightly deeper answer, then 31/365 or 31/366 is correct, depending upon whether the year is a normal year or a leap year.   The correct answer, which might be argued as "philosophical", is as follows:    The Gregorian calender, the current standard calender in most of the world, adds a 29th day to February, 97 years out of 400, a closer approximation than once every four years.  This would be implemented by making a leap year every year divisible by 4 unless that year is divisible by 100.  If it is divisible by 100 it would only be a leap year if that year was also divisible by 400.. 
So, in the last millennium, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.  In this millennium, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2900 and 3000 will not be leap years, but 2400 and 2800 will be.  The years that are divisible by 100 but not 400 are known as "exceptional common years".  By this rule, the average number of days per year will be 365 + 1/4 - 1/100 + 1/400 = 365.2425..

There are assumptions in the above answer as well. These are 1. That all days in a year have the equal probability (which is not strictly true, as records of births will be required for verification) 2. The Gregorian calender has been in effect since 1700s.

It is not possible to give a proper answer to the question because the children's are not independent. Among other things they depend on the parents' genetics and their age and there is no information on either of those factors. Also, the probability of a male child is not 0.5 as it is often naively assumed to be. It is, in fat, around 0.52.  However, if you suspend reality and assume that  .

Unfortunately there is no readily available research into the genders of seven or more children to establish the experimental probability for such an outcome.    However, if you assume that they are independent events then, given that the probability of a girl is approx 0.48, then the probability of the seventh child being a girl is 0.48.

The answer depends on how many times the coin is tossed. The probability is zero if the coin is tossed only once!   Making some assumptions and rewording your question as "If I toss a fair coin twice, what is the probability it comes up heads both times" then the probability of it being heads on any given toss is 0.5, and the probability of it being heads on both tosses is 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25.  If you toss it three times and want to know what the probability of it being heads exactly twice is, then the calculation is more complicated, but it comes out to 0.375.

Answer by solver91311(22617)   ( Show Source ): You can put this solution on YOUR website!    All Wednesdays:  There are seven different days in the week, so the probability that one person is born on a given day is .  Since each of the three birthdays is an independent event, the total probability is the product of the three individual probabilities:     Different day of the week:  The probability that the first guy is born on any one of the 7 days in the week is certainty, or 1.  The probability that the second guy was born on a different day is the number of days unused so far, or 6 divided by the number of possible days, or 7.  The probability that the third guy was born on yet a different day is calculated the same way, this time 5 divided by 7.  Again the total probability is the product:     None on Saturday:  6 out of 7 ways not to be born on Saturday, so:     By the way, you get to do your own arithmetic.

A classic example is the Tuesday Birthday Problem (TBP), which a reader has asked me to comment on.  Let’s dive right in by stating the problem:  You meet a man on the street and he says, “I have two children and one is a son born on a Tuesday.”  What is the probability that the other child is also a son?  Seems innocent enough.  But if you’re first inclination is to say that the information about the Tuesday birthday is irrelevant and the answer is just 1/2, then read on.  Let’s try a simpler problem.  Suppose we know that a certain man has two children and we also know that the older one is a boy.  In this case we would say that the probability that the other child is a boy is 1/2.  After all, the sex of one child is independent of the sex of the other child.  That the older child is a boy has no bearing on the sex of the younger child.  Now suppose we know simply that a man has two children and that one of them is a son.  This time we would reason that there is no possibility that the person has two girls.  It follows that the sexes of his two children, ordered from oldest to youngest, are either BB, BG or GB.  Since these cases are equally likely, and since only one of them involves having two boys, we would say the probability that the man has two boys is 1/3.  This is all very cogent, but there are complications we haven’t yet considered.  We shall return to this in a moment.  Now let’s consider the TBP.  Everyone’s first instinct is to think the information about the Tuesday birthday is simply irrelevant.  I mean, seriously, you knew each of the kids was born on some day of the week, so what possible difference could it make that you now know one was born on a Tuesday?  Well, here’s the difference.  Let us first assume that it is the older child who was a son born on a Tuesday.  In this case the second child could be either of two sexes, and could have been born on any of seven days of the week, for a total of 14 possibilities.  Now let’s suppose it is the younger child who was a son born on a Tuesday.  Then the older child could, again, be either of two sexes and could have been born on any of seven days of the week, again providing 14 possibilities.  Added to our original 14 that would seem to give 28 possibilities.  But be careful!  One possibility got counted twice.  Specifically, the one where both children are boys born on Tuesdays.  So really there are only 27 possibilities.  And since 13 of them involve the second child being a boy, the probability would be 13/27.  Were this the end of the story it would still be a fascinating problem.  It is genuinely surprising that the information about the Tuesday birthday could be relevant, but our simple count shows that it is.  Now, we should mention at this point that we are discussing mathematical children who have no existence outside the world of probabilistic brainteasers.  So we’re not worrying about the fact that a disproportionate number of children are born on Mondays and Tuesdays, since C-sections aren’t usually scheduled for the weekends.  We’re also not worrying about twins or triplets.  Or any other sort of “real world” consideration that might occur to you.  But there is a complication we should ponder.  When you are thinking about problems in conditional probability, it is not only the new piece of information that is relevant.  You also must consider how the information was obtained.  The classic example of this is the Monty Hall problem.  (I shall assume you are familiar with this problem.  If you are not, I know a good book you should read.)  The common fallacy is to ignore what we know about how Monty makes decisions.  Thus, when he opens an empty door we tend to think, mistakenly, that we have only learned that that door is empty.  In reality we have learned that Monty, who makes his decisions in a rigidly controlled way, chose to take a certain action.  That has relevance to all of these problems about the two children.  How we assess the probability that the second child is a boy will depend in part on how we learned that one of the children was a boy in the first place.  Peter Winkler explains the significance of this point:  This puzzle confounds people *legitimately*, however, because most of the ways in which you are likely to find out that X has at least one boy contain an implicit bias which changes the answer.  For example, if you happen to meet one of X’s children and it’s a boy, the answer changes to 1/2.  Suppose the puzzle is phrased this way: X says “I have two children and at least one is a boy.” What is the probability that the other is a boy?  Put this way, the puzzle is highly ambiguous. Computer scientists, cryptologists and others who must deal carefully with message-passing know that what counts is not what a person says (even if she is known never to lie) but *under what circumstances would she have said it.*  Here, there is no context and thus no way to know what prompted X to make this statement. Could he instead have said “At least one is a girl”? Could he have said “Both are boys”? Could he have said nothing? If you, the one faced with solving the puzzle, are desperate to disambiguate it, you’d probably have to assume that what really happened was: X (for some reason unconnected with X’s identity) was asked whether it was the case that he had at least one son, and, after being warned–by a judge?–that he had to give a yes-or-no answer, said “yes.” An unlikely scenario, to say the least, but necessary if you want to claim that the solution to the puzzle is 1/3.  This article from Science News helps explain the relevant distinction in these sorts of problems:  Suppose that you already knew that Mr. Smith had two children, and then you meet him on the street with a boy he introduces as his son. In that case, the probability the other child is a son would be 1/2, just as intuition suggests. On the other hand, suppose that you are looking for a male beagle puppy. You want a puppy that has been raised with a sibling for good socialization but you are afraid it will be hard to select just a single puppy from a large litter. So you find a breeder who has exactly two pups and call to confirm that at least one is male. Then the probability that the other is male is 1/3.  In the scenario of Mr. Smith, you’re randomly selecting a child from his two children and then noticing his sex. In the puppy scenario, you’re randomly selecting a two-puppy family with at least one male. (Emphasis added.)  This all takes some getting used to.  If you’re like me, then it just seems obvious to you that knowing the sex of the older child tells you nothing about the sex of the younger.  But the scenario in which you meet one of the children on the street just sounds different.  It sounds more like our initial scenario, in which we know simply that a father has two children and one is a boy.  We should be thinking like this:  Are you being asked to infer the sex of one person based solely on information about someone else?  Or are you being asked to comment on the distribution of sexes among families with multiple children, given information about one of the children?  As the Science News article goes on to note, this has a curious consequence:  The remarkable thing that Foshee’s variation points out is that any piece of information that affects the selection will also affect the probability. If, for example, you selected a family at random among those with two kids, one of whom is a boy who plays the ukulele and wants to become a dancer, the ukulele-playing and dancing ambitions would affect the probabilities about the sex of his sibling.  That still seems weird to me, even though it is precisely the main principle in the Monty Hall problem.  Anyway, Tanya Khovanonva provdes some variations on the TBP to illustrate what is going on:  Now let us consider the first scenario. A father of two children is picked at random. He is instructed to choose a child by flipping a coin. Then he has to provide information about the chosen child in the following format: “I have a son/daughter born on Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun.” If his statement is, “I have a son born on Tuesday,” what is the probability that the second child is also a son?  The probability that a father of two daughters will make such a statement is zero. The probability that a father of differently-gendered children will produce such a statement is 1/14. Indeed, with a probability of 1/2 the son is chosen over the daughter and with a probability of 1/7 Tuesday is the birthday.  The probability that a father of two sons will make this statement is 1/7. Among the fathers with two children, there are twice as many who have a son and a daughter than fathers who have two sons. Plugging these numbers into the formula for calculating the conditional probability will give us a probability of 1/2 for the second child to also be a son.  This fits well with our analysis.  In this scenario a child is selected at random, and then information is provided about his sex and birth day.  We are thus being asked to infer the sex of one child based solely on information about the sex (and birth day) of the other.  Thus, we expect the answer to be 1/2.  In other words, knowing the sex of one child tells us nothing about the sex of the other.  Now let us consider the second scenario. A father of two children is picked at random. If he has two daughters he is sent home and another one picked at random until a father is found who has at least one son. If he has one son, he is instructed to provide information on his son’s day of birth. If he has two sons, he has to choose one at random. His statement will be, “I have a son born on Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun.” If his statement is, “I have a son born on Tuesday,” what is the probability that the second child is also a son?  The probability that a father of differently-gendered children will produce such a statement is 1/7. If he has two sons, the probability will likewise be 1/7. Among the fathers with two children, twice as many have a son and a daughter as have two sons. Plugging these numbers into the formula for calculating the conditional probability gives us a probability of 1/3 for the second child to also be a son.  In this scenario our focus has shifted to the distribution of sexes in a family with two children.  Thus, the knowledge that there is at least one boy is relevant.  But given the procedure we employed in deciding who to ask, the day of the week on which the boy is born is not relevant to the distribution of sexes.  Thus, we get precisely the 1/3 answer we discussed earlier.  Now let us consider the third scenario. A father of two children is picked at random. If he doesn’t have a son who is born on Tuesday, he is sent home and another is picked at random until one who has a son that was born on Tuesday is found. He is instructed to tell you, “I have a son born on Tuesday.” What is the probability that the second child is also a son?  The probability that a father of two daughters will have a son born on Tuesday is zero. The probability that a father of differently-gendered children will have a son who is born on Tuesday is 1/7. The probability that a father of two sons will have a son born on Tuesday is 13/49. Among the fathers with two children, twice as many have a son and a daughter than two sons. Plugging these numbers into the formula for calculating the conditional probability will give us a probability of 13/27 for the second child to also be a son.  And here it was built into our selection procedure that we are only surveying families with two children, with the added assumption that one of them is a boy born on Tuesday. If you surveyed all such families, you would find that roughly 13/27 of them have two boys.  If you read the Science News article I linked to, you will find that this problem was raised at the Ninth Gathering for Gardner, a conference held biennially in honor of Martin Gardner, in Atlanta.  As it happens, I was at that conference, as was Tanya.  We discussed this problem at length.  My initial reaction was that it should be irrelevant that one child was born on a Tuesday.  But then, thinking that the problem would not have been raised if the obvious answer were correct, I managed to enumerate the sample space and came up with 13/27.  I was pleased with myself, but Tanya gave me an earful about unwarranted assumptions.  She was right, of course.  On the other hand, as I noted in the BMHB (that’s the big Monty Hall book), and as I suggested to Tanya at the conference, there really does come a time when the hair-splitting must stop, unless we are specifically trying to drive people insane with these problems!

A father of two children is picked at random. If he doesn’t have a son, he is sent home and another is picked at random until one who has a son is found. He is instructed to tell you, “I have a son born on whatever-day-of-the-week one of his sons was born.”  It seems to me impossible to distinguish these scenarios, in how the problem is first posed. The assumption to the counting argument is that the right set to consider is all men with two children including a son born on Tuesday, rather than all men including a son, born on some day of the week.          #4  Another Matt   November 8, 2011    There’s another complication in the wording, where in normal speech the question could be understood as:  ‘You meet a man on the street and he says, “I have two children and [only] one is a son born on a Tuesday.” What is the probability that the other child is also a son?’  Or ‘I have two children and one is a son born on a Tuesday [and the other is not].’  Understood this way, it would eliminate completely the two boys born on Tuesday scenario, which would make it even less likely that the other was a son (12/26)  Imagine I said, “I have two dogs. One of them is a poodle.” In everyday conversation this means that I have one poodle and one of some other breed because I’m assumed to be trying to convey information clearly and efficiently, and I would just say “both are poodles” rather than “one is a poodle and the other is a poodle” if indeed I had two poodles.  The problem with the TBP is that a question is posed after the informative statement. If I said instead, “I have two dogs. One of them is a poodle. What do you think the other is?” The way you go about answering that question has a lot to do with whether or not you have reason to believe I’m trying to trick you.  A lot of punks on the playground exploit ambiguities in language to win bets.          #5  John Jacob Lyons   November 9, 2011    An intriguing problem Jason but, as far as I know, it is only of academic interest. No jury has ever been fooled into a ‘guilty’ verdict because of the fallacy, for example. This is not so for the ‘Prosecutor’s Fallacy’. This has certainly caused several appalling miscarriages of justice in UK courts. On these occasions, innocent mothers have been found guilty of murder after a so-called ‘expert witness’ (falsely) told the court that the probability of two cot-deaths in one family was about 73 million to 1. The case of Sally Clark several years ago was a well-known, and tragic, example.  The fallacy arises when the (irrelevant) ‘conditional probability of the occurrence of the event(s) assuming innocence’ is confused with the (relevant) ‘conditional probability of innocence given the happening of the event(s)’.  Lack of knowledge of probability theory can cause very rough justice in courts of law.          #6  Wow   November 9, 2011    There isn’t anything saying that ONLY one is a Son born on Tuesday, though.  Like the old gambler joke: I have two pair: two pairs of Aces.  This is somewhat different than the Monty Haul proposition (IIRC the name), where you’re allowed to change your mind after selecting which of three doors you’re going choose a prize behind when after your choice, one of the dud doors is revealed as empty of a prize.  Should you change?  Answer: yes.          #7  Another Matt   November 9, 2011    “There isn’t anything saying that ONLY one is a Son born on Tuesday, though.”  Not in the words themselves, but in the information the words are assumed to imply in everyday conversation. If I see someone on the street that I haven’t seen in a decade, and I say “how the hell are ya?!” and she says “I’m great! I have four kids now, and one of them is a girl!” — I just have to assume that the other three are boys because nobody ever says “one of them is a girl, and one of the remaining three is a girl, and one of the remaining two is a girl, and the yet unenumerated child is a boy.”  It’s why we have the phrase “at least.” If the original problem were phrased “I have two children. At least one of them is a son born on a Tuesday.” then there would be no ambiguity of meaning.  It’s really the same problem with inclusive and exclusive OR, isn’t it? — it’s all about context. If I’m at an amusement park and I tell my child, “You can have ice cream or a funnel cake.” and he says “ICE CREEEEAAAM,” when he’s done he doesn’t get to say, “I shall have a funnel cake as well, please, for I understood your use of ‘or’ to be in the inclusive sense, dad, and my behavior will not be contrary to the permission you gave if I have ice cream AND a funnel cake. Next time be sure to include ‘but not both,’ dad, if that’s what you really mean.”          #8  Wow   November 9, 2011    “but in the information the words are assumed to imply in everyday conversation”  But in everyday conversation, one child is a son doesn’t say that the second one isn’t a son.  It is more information to say “at least”, but in a society and language where “Hi” is enough to greet someone, where “‘sup” means “What’s up” and all those other places where contraction is used to reduce information, missing “at least” isn’t providing any information.  And you’re right: it does depend on context. The context being here “lets trick you into giving the ‘wrong’ answer!”.  The context missing means that we have the words as said. And they don’t say “only one of which is a Son”.          #9  eric   November 9, 2011    Wow: But in everyday conversation, one child is a son doesn’t say that the second one isn’t a son.  I think Another Matt is right, and “one child…” does imply the second child isn’t a son.  Because the speaker has a choice of picking to use the word “one” or “two.”  And if the speaker chooses to use the word “one,” in common speech you can assume she didn’t mean “two.”  In your argument, Wow, every time we hear “one” in such a sentence, we should interpret that to mean “greater than or equal to one.”  But I do not see why “greater than or equal to” should be presumed.  What is the logic behind presuming that is what the person meant?  It seems a lot more verbally sensible to assume that the word “one” typically refers to the number 1 and not the mathematical ‘>=1.          #10  MKR   November 9, 2011    Another Matt makes a good point. Getting the correct solution to a mathematical “story problem”–that is, the solution which would be deemed correct by those who devised the problem–very often depends on a strict interpretation of the words used, which in some cases is at odds with the pragmatics of ordinary conversation. Those who are adept at such problems (call them the skillful) may think that persons who interpret “one of them is a boy” to imply that the other is not a boy (call those who assume this interpretation the unskillful) are misinterpreting the words. But I would say that what is going on is that the skillful are wise to the pragmatic rules that govern story problems while the unskillful simply follow the rules of ordinary conversation.          #11  Wow   November 9, 2011    “Those who are adept at such problems (call them the skillful)”  Or weird.  I’d prefer to call those who pose such problems “Silly”.  After all, 1/2 is right if you take one meaning of the question, therefore you’re right saying 1/2. If you take another meaning of the question, you get a different number. They are all correct, even though they may not be the one that the one posing the question thought was correct.  Which is why it’s a silly question: there’s several right answers. Not just one.          #12  Wow   November 9, 2011    “I think Another Matt is right, and “one child…” does imply the second child isn’t a son.”  If both are sons, then is one child not a son?  No.  “Only one child is a Son” means specifically only one. “At least one” means one or two are sons. “One may be a son” is that there may or may not be at least one son.  If you’re going to put words in there to make the meaning clear, then the question is no longer the one asked, it’s the one you’re answering.  Which means that unless you get that wrong, you’ll be right, even if the one asking thinks you’re wrong.          #13  Another Matt   November 9, 2011    But in everyday conversation, one child is a son doesn’t say that the second one isn’t a son.  I have three bridges for sale. One is a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.          #14  eric   November 9, 2011    Wow:  If you’re going to put words in there to make the meaning clear, then the question is no longer the one asked.  We must mentally put words in there because, without clarification, the sentence can have multiple meanings.  The question is what the speaker was trying to communicate.  Did the speaker intend to communicate 1.0 son or ‘>=1 son?  What I’m saying is absent any contextual clues, the first makes a lot more sense to assume.  Because if she’d wanted to communicate to you that she’d had two sons, she would’ve said ‘two’ instead of ‘one.’  Now, I’ll concede that in some contexts – if a speaker is giving a riddle, playing a verbal joke, or just being an ass – then your interpretation could be warranted.  If you phrase Matt’s scenario as “One logician jokingly said to the other ‘I now have two kids, and one is a son!'” then yeah, you could be right in interpreting 1 to mean ‘>=1.”  But absent those contextual clues, I don’t think your position holds much water.          #15  Wow   November 9, 2011    “We must mentally put words in there because, without clarification, the sentence can have multiple meanings”  And then you no longer have the question asked.  You have the question you decided to answer.  If it doesn’t say that only one son is there, then there is nothing saying there cannot be two sons.  But, like I said several times before, the question is silly because you “have to” add words to the question to get a question.  But the question asked said nothing about there being only one son.          #16  Wow   November 9, 2011    “I have three bridges for sale. One is a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.”  Or, maybe, I have the London Bridge to sell you. 🙂  Assuming words not in evidence is not a good move, in general, if someone is trying to trick you.  There are two bridges crossing the Severn. Just saying “there’s one bridge crossing it, what does the other bridge cross?” isn’t going to mean the second bridge can’t be crossing the Severn too. If I were to tell you there was only one bridge crossing the Severn, then you’d be right (though only because I lied)          #17  eric   November 9, 2011    If it doesn’t say that only one son is there, then there is nothing saying there cannot be two sons.  Yes, there is: the speaker’s choice of the word “one” instead of “two.” You keep ignoring this information as if it doesn’t exist.  Which is, now that I think about it, exactly the sort of error Jason was talking about in his post.          #18  Wow   November 9, 2011    “Yes, there is: the speaker’s choice of the word “one” instead of “two.””  No there isn’t: the lack of “only”.  You need “only one” for there to be only one.  I keep ignoring this information because it DOESN’T exist.  There is no information there saying only one son.  If you wish to point out where it does say “only one”, I shall investigate and maybe recant.          #19  Wow   November 9, 2011    I think the problem might be what my original claim stated has morphed by virtue of misapprehension of what I meant and poor wording allowing it.  I’ll see if I can work out another wording that makes my point clearer.  It may be some time…          #20  Another Matt   November 9, 2011    If you wish to point out where it does say “only one”, I shall investigate and maybe recant.  I think it’s only in the context, and you’ve been making this point yourself by saying things like “Assuming words not in evidence is not a good move, in general, if someone is trying to trick you.” But assuming words not in evidence has to happen all the time for efficient communication in everyday language. There are two contexts in the original problem – one is the one asserted in the problem (viz. that you meet a man on the street and he says something to you – the “everyday language” context) and the other is the statement of the problem itself (the “uh oh a logician might be trying to trick me” context). It’s just an ambiguity that is usually resolved one way normally but possibly another way if there’s a scheme afoot.  Here’s another example. What are the subtle differences between the following? 1) “I flipped a coin 20 times. One flip came up heads.” 2) “I flipped a coin 20 times. One of those times it came up heads.” 3) “I flipped a coin 20 times. It came up heads one of those times. 4) “I flipped a coin 20 times. It came up heads once.” 5) “I flipped a coin 20 times. Of those 20 flips, one was heads.” 6) “I flipped a coin 20 times. One of those times it came up heads. ONE!!”  etc.  There are other contexts where it’s pretty clear that “one” does not necessarily mean “only one” – especially cases where one is learning or teaching.  “I have two coins that together equal 10 cents. One of them is a nickel. What is the other?” This is a deduction problem for kindergarten, and it’s clear that the other one could be a nickel as well; the image is more like “I have a coin in my right hand and one in my left. They equal 10 cents. Pick a hand and I’ll open it, and then you tell me what’s in the other hand. Oooh! My right hand has a nickel; so we know that one of them is a nickel, and remember that together they equal 10 cents. What do you think the other one is?”  This is actually pretty close in context to the original problem – it’s just the “man on the street” scenario that bugs me, and especially if extra words can be added to disambiguate the point at hand.          #21  cwfong   November 9, 2011    Have you considered the reputation of the speaker?  If he’s a notorious trickster and liar, then it’s no longer a math problem – assuming that it ever was.          #22  CRM-114   November 9, 2011    You meet a man on the street and he says, “I have two children and one is a son born on a Tuesday.” What is the probability that you will be correct in your assumptions about why he picked you to tell, and why he chose to tell you this, and why he chose that particular wording?  A true mathematician will convince himself that all his assumptions will all be perfectly correct.          #23  Another Matt   November 9, 2011    A true mathematician will convince himself that all his assumptions will all be perfectly correct.  This is the “no true mathematician” fallacy.          #24  BKsea   November 10, 2011    epic fail! (I think)  When you were enumerating the possibilities, you also have to enumerate the choice of days that the father has when both children are sons.  If they are born on different days, he has 2 choices and there is only a 50% chance he will pick Tuesday. If they are both born on Tuesday, there is a 100% chance he picks Tuesday.  If you correct for this factor, the information about Tuesday becomes irrelevant and order is restored to the universe.          #25  Wow   November 10, 2011    I don’t think it’s an *epic* fail.  However, it does illustrate that if you put words in the question that doesn’t exist in the question to make sense of it, you’re changing the question.  The sons could be twins. He has one son born on the same day as the other.  We leave it there, we don’t add “and the other son is born on the same day as the other other one”.  Two sons. Two tuesdays. One son IS born on Tuesday.          #26  Markk   November 10, 2011    All of these are just ways that show how we map English (or other natural languages) to sets of possible outcomes. You could say things like this are optical illusions for our mind because they are doing similar things – making our heuristic or natural interpretation come in conflict with a not obvious bit in information. Drwing lines around possible outcomes and drawing the possible outcomes often makes things real clear that the ground – the set of possible outcomes being considered, is shifting under you’re feet.          #27  John Jacob Lyons   November 10, 2011    I suggest that a question can only be answered unambiguously if the question itself is unambiguous. It is the responsibility of the person posing the question to ensure that this is the case. Despite this, if the person attempting to answer the question spots an ambiguity he/she can either (a) seek clarification from the poser or (b) provide answers for each of the possible meanings he/she can identify.  With ambiguity, the only exception to the above would be when the answer is the same whichever meaning is intended.          #28  CherryBombSim   November 11, 2011    Thanks. I had never heard of the TBP before. It made me think of this scenario:  A man tells you he has a son who is left-handed, the probability that he has two sons would be close to 1/2. If he tells you he has a son who is right-handed, the probability of two sons is closer to 1/3. Cute.          #29  jahigginbotham   November 11, 2011    #4,  True for poodles, but not other necessarily other animals:  A farmer wanted to control snakes, so he decided to buy a some predators. The only problem was that he didn’t know the plural of “mongoose.” He started the letter: “To whom it may concern, I need two mongeese.” But that didn’t sound right so he tried again: “To whom it may concern, I need two mongooses.” “Is that right?” he thought to himself. Finally, he got an idea: “To whom it may concern, I need one mongoose, and while you’re at it, please send me another one.”          #30  Antaeus Feldspar   November 12, 2011    Now, we should mention at this point that we are discussing mathematical children who have no existence outside the world of probabilistic brainteasers.  Well, this is fine, but…  Here, there is no context and thus no way to know what prompted X to make this statement. Could he instead have said “At least one is a girl”? Could he have said “Both are boys”? Could he have said nothing? If you, the one faced with solving the puzzle, are desperate to disambiguate it, you’d probably have to assume that what really happened was: X (for some reason unconnected with X’s identity) was asked whether it was the case that he had at least one son, and, after being warned–by a judge?–that he had to give a yes-or-no answer, said “yes.”  Why specify that we’re talking about mathematical children and then express such disbelief that the people talking about those mathematical children would be talking mathematically?  Sure, in a more real-world conversation, people are unlikely to say that a descriptor such as “male” or “born on a Tuesday” applies to one of their children when it actually applies to both…  but then for consistency you’d have to consider that C-sections are rarely scheduled for weekends, et cetera.  Anyways, my real problem is this:  That still seems weird to me, even though it is precisely the main principle in the Monty Hall problem.  Ummm…  no, it really isn’t, except in the most general possible terms.  The Two Children Problem, and Tuesday Birthday Problem, both deal with two random events; the Monty Hall problem has only one random event.  In addition, the TCP and TBP both deal with certain combinations that are possible outcomes of the random events but which are prohibited by the problem description (e.g. the two children both being girls); many people believe that this is also true of the MHP but that’s only the case in the misunderstood version of the problem where it’s believed that Monty only opens a door that’s empty by chance, not because he knows which doors are empty and deliberately opens an empty door.  The principle really isn’t the same.          #31  Another Matt   November 13, 2011    …the TCP and TBP both deal with certain combinations that are possible outcomes of the random events but which are prohibited by the problem description (e.g. the two children both being girls); many people believe that this is also true of the MHP but that’s only the case in the misunderstood version of the problem where it’s believed that Monty only opens a door that’s empty by chance, not because he knows which doors are empty and deliberately opens an empty door.  Except that what you’ve just described is where the dispute about sampling with the TBP comes in – how the information about the father was obtained (or equivalently, how the sample pool of fathers was selected, or which population you take the father as representing – the population of all fathers with two children, the population of all fathers with two children and at least one son, or the population of all fathers with two children and at least one son born on tuesday) leads to one of three different probabilities for a two-son father outcome. Here’s a more simple example that will illustrate this more easily:  Say I’ve put each of two six-sided dice in its own separate cup. I turn the cups over, and then I call you on the phone and say “I can tell you that at least one of the dice came up ‘1’. Would you rather bet that I’ve rolled snake-eyes, or that I’ve rolled a ‘7’?”  Your answer to this depend a little on what you think led me to say “at least one of the dice has come up ‘1’.” In the case that I have lifted only one of the cups and it happened to be a 1, then the probability for snake-eyes and for ‘7’ is still just 1/6. But if I’ve looked at both of them, then the possible rolls that will have elicited “at least one has come up 1” is:  1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1  Which leaves a 1/11 probability for snake-eyes and 2/11 for ‘7’. So clearly in that scenario I would do better to bet on 7 than snake-eyes. Since I don’t know how you’ve gotten your information I should bet on 7 each time.  The first scenario – choosing one cup randomly and finding that its die has happened to come up ‘1’ is somewhat analogous to the MHP where Monty really does choose a door at random that happens to be empty. The second scenario where I’ve looked at both dice is analogous to the MHP where Monty knows which doors are empty and always chooses the empty one. In both cases – the MHP and the dice game – you don’t lose anything by assuming Monty has more information.  BTW you could recast the TBP as a dice game where I have four cups, two red and two blue, and I put one “7-sided die” in one red cup and one in a blue cup, and a coin in the other red and blue cup each, and flipped them all over. If I tell you that “at least one of the colors had a coin that came up heads, and at least one heads was associated with a dice-roll of ‘3’ under a cup with the same color,” your answer to the probability that both coins were heads would be determined by how many of the cups (and in what order) I’ve lifted to give you that information. If I lifted two cups of the same color and found that it happened to be “heads, 3” then the probability the coin under the other cup is heads would be 1/2. If I lifted the two coin cups and happened to find one or two heads, and then lifted one of the dice cups with the same color as a heads and happened to find a 3, then the probability they were both heads is 1/3. If I lifted all four cups and found that at least one pairing was “heads, 3” then the probability the other is heads would be the 13/27 from the original problem — all of these are the same as the analysis in Jason’s post.          #32  Wow   November 14, 2011    “people are unlikely to say that a descriptor such as “male” or “born on a Tuesday” applies to one of their children when it actually applies to both”  But then again, people are even less likely to ask the question posed.  And why then did they ask what sex their other child was if they’ve said one is male when “male” applies to both?          #33  Antaeus Feldspar   November 14, 2011    The first scenario – choosing one cup randomly and finding that its die has happened to come up ‘1’ is somewhat analogous to the MHP where Monty really does choose a door at random that happens to be empty. The second scenario where I’ve looked at both dice is analogous to the MHP where Monty knows which doors are empty and always chooses the empty one. In both cases – the MHP and the dice game – you don’t lose anything by assuming Monty has more information.  Only the latter of those is the actual Monty Hall problem, however.  I will stipulate that yes, sometimes people state the problem ambiguously, or even incorrectly, and produce the impression that Monty opening an empty door is simply what happens by chance on this particular occasion – but that isn’t the Monty Hall problem.  Ironically, the door-is-empty-by-chance variant of the MHP (let’s call it the EBCV) has more in common with TBP than MHP does.  MHP has only one meaningful random event, and that is whether the prize winds up after the player’s initial pick a) in the one-member set of “doors that the player picked” or b) in the two-member set of “doors that the player didn’t pick.”  In EBCV, there is the random event of whether the prize wound up behind the door that the player picked, and then the random event of whether the prize wound up behind the door Monty picked out of the two remaining.  Except that since the problem description states that Monty opens an empty door, we discount the two cases where he picks the prize door.  TBP and EBCV have that basic similarity in common, but I really can’t see how one can say that TBP and MHP are working on the same principle.          #34  Another Matt   November 16, 2011    I think we’re disagreeing on the level of generality or abstraction. Here’s the principle from the original post:  …any piece of information that affects the selection will also affect the probability.  It’s pretty clear that this principle is at play in the difference in resulting probabilities between the MHP and your EBCV, and also that the various flavors of TBP with their resulting probability outcomes differ because of this principle. I don’t think it’s meant to extend beyond this level of generality.          #35  Antaeus Feldspar   November 17, 2011     …any piece of information that affects the selection will also affect the probability.  …  It’s pretty clear that this principle is at play in the difference in resulting probabilities between the MHP and your EBCV, and also that the various flavors of TBP with their resulting probability outcomes differ because of this principle. I don’t think it’s meant to extend beyond this level of generality.  Well, if that’s what was meant, I certainly agree that that principle applies to both problems.  I just didn’t think that could be what was meant, because it’s certainly not ‘precise’ (as that adjective is distinguished from ‘accurate’.)          #36  Wow   November 17, 2011    Although in the given TBP there is no apparent choice in telling you the one and only tuesday’s child. You have to put one in there.  Since they’re already admitting that despite having said one is a son, there is a probability that they have TWO sons, why is it not that, despite having said that one is born on Tuesday, there is no possibility that they have TWO children born on Tuesday?  With the doors, Monty KNOWS which doors are empty.  And that information is partially passed on when he opens one door AFTER you chose a door.  And it’s that that makes the MHP solution “you’re better off changing your mind”.  If the questioner were picking the son born on Tuesday, then the chance that their other child is a son is zero.          #37  Another Matt   November 17, 2011    Although in the given TBP there is no apparent choice in telling you the one and only tuesday’s child. You have to put one in there.  Yeah, that was a side issue which gave yet a fourth interpretation of the words. If you look at Tanya Khovanova’s analysis above, or my reframing using dice and coins, you’ll see that what questions elicited the “I have two kids, and one is a boy born on Tuesday” testimony affects the selection criteria for the population of fathers the one in question represents, and thus affects the probability that the other is a son. If you were placing a bet about whether the other child was a boy or a girl, and the probability it was a boy was 1/2, 1/3, or 13/27 (or 12/26 in the side-issue interpretation), if you didn’t know how to interpret the information, or didn’t know how it was gathered, you’d do well to bet on “girl.” In the analogy between MHP and TBP, “Monty KNOWS which doors are empty” is roughly equivalent to “The father KNOWS the sex and the day on which both of his children were born.”          #38  John K.   November 18, 2011    There is a fatal mistake.  You made order important in the case of different sex siblings and order unimportant in the case of same sex siblings.  If order is unimportant there are 2 sets: BB, or BG.  If order is important BB must be counted twice, once for each order of birth, the same as for different sex siblings.  The order important set must then be BB, BB, BG, GB.  The probability of 2 boys remains 2/4 or 1/2.  This mistake goes forward to the days of the week.  Order must be uniformly important or unimportant, so there is no prohibition on which day of the week the other child is born on.  The probability remains ½.          #39  Brent Ashley   November 29, 2011    Introducing the ordering of the children in the 1/3 scenario is a spurious requirement.  One might also introduce the completely irrelevant requirement of handedness, with the unbalanced probability of 1/7 left to 6/7 right, further complicating things, however there was no requirement to do so.          #40  Britton Smith   November 29, 2011    I was also unsure of the point raised in comment 38 about whether the ordering of the children is important and potentially reduces the final probability back to 50%.  So I did the only thing I could think of to ease my mind, and coded up a brute force test of the Tuesday Birthday Problem.  In this, I have a function that generates a child with a random sex and birthday.  It has another function that generates them in pairs and only keeps a pair in which at least one of the children has the desired sex and birthday.  I then do this 1,000,000 times and measure the number of times the second child was the sex we were looking for.  You can download it here: http://paste.yt-project.org/show/1971/ Assuming you have Python installed, you can run it with the following command: python tbp.py  I tested this using a varying number of total matches, and 1,000,000 was well enough converged to be conclusive and I did indeed find that the answer is 13/27.          #41  Britton Smith   November 29, 2011    Silly me, I had a bad character in a comment in the header.  Here it is again with that fixed.  This one also gives a running tally of the percentage as it goes:  http://paste.yt-project.org/show/1972/          #42  Bart   November 30, 2011    Disclaimer – NEVER CARRY A BOMB ON A PLANE (OR ANYWHERE ELSE), the following is only for academic purposes:  You should always carry a bomb on a plane because the chances of TWO people carrying a bomb on a plane are much lower than one person carrying a bomb on a plane.          #43  Richard Wein   December 1, 2011    To those discussing the wording of the original question…  We need to distinguish between real situations and mathematical abstractions. If we were talking about a real situation (i.e. someone actually had the experience described) there would be a fact of the matter as to what the man meant and we could make some judgement (perhaps a probabilistic one) about his meaning, based on all the information available to us.  The case here is not a real situation, but an abstraction invented for its mathematical interest. There is no fact of the matter as to what the man really meant. Mathematicians think about such artificial problems because they are of some theoretical interest. The original problem raises issues that are of mathematical interest, but, having raised the issues, mathematicians’ interest is in exploring those issues, and not necessarily in answering exactly the original question. So they formulate alternative questions which are better suited to clarifying the issues that interest them, as Tanya had done.          #44  John K.   December 2, 2011    @ Britton Smith  My programming skill is rudimentary at best, but having looked at the code you linked to, will your filter correctly handle the case of both siblings having the correct target birthday and sex?  It seems like such a case would incorrectly trigger both if statements.  I have no idea how Python handles sequential if statements, so I apologize if I am incorrect on this.  I must otherwise admit that I am wrong on this.  I am still baffled why not considering order will give a different answer than making order important does, if I am indeed incorrect.  Thank you for putting your programming skills to task on this problem, by the way.          #45  gr8hands   December 6, 2011    Thank you John K. @38 for making the point I was going to make.          #46  JeffJo   December 11, 2011    @Richard Wein  You meet a man on the street and he says, “I have two children. What is the probability my two children share the same gender?” This seems easy; 1/2.  You meet a woman on the street and she says, “One of my two children is a son. What is the probability my two children share the same gender?” By your reply above, it seems you would say 1/3. But what if the woman had said “One of my two children is a daughter?” If this is really just a matter of being a “mathematical abstraction,” your answer would have to be 1/3 also. But if it is 1/3 regardless of what the woman says, how is the problem different than the one about the man?  It isn’t. This fact was first recognized by Joseph Bertrand in 1889 when he published his famous Box Paradox, which I tweaked only by adding a fourth case. Other than that, the two problems are identical. With that fourth case, the “wrong” answer is 1/3, and the “right” one is 1/2. As a “mathematical abstraction,” you have to include the probability of obtaining the information you have, not just the probability that it is true, or else you will get a paradox.          #47  Stuart H   June 29, 2012    Sorry, but no.  The Tuesday is irrelevant.  If the son who was born on a Tuesday is the older son, then there are 2*7 = 14 ways to choose the second son, and 7 of those ways are boys, so its a 50% chance.  If the son who was born on a Tuesday is the younger son, then there are 2*7 = 14 ways to choose the second son, and 7 of those ways are boys, so its a 50% chance.  You DO NOT adsd 14 + 14 to get 28 total configurations (minus 1 for overlap)…rather, you see that the answer is 50% regardless of this unknown information.  Based on the logic of this paper, you could always arbitrarily condition your numbers based on additional information and change the result.  Not the case.          #48  JeffJo   July 20, 2012    And with the third half of the pie … 🙂  Stuart H, your solution is wrong because it counts the family of two boys, both born on a Tuesday, twice. In that family, we do not know if the either son was being specifically referred to.  However, the answer (the number 50%) you give is right, for different reasons.  Of the 196 possible combinations:  169 do not include a boy born on a Tuesday. We can only assume the man you met is truthful, so he can’t be one of these 169 combinations.  14 have a boy born on a Tuesday and a girl;  7 where the boy is the older child, and 7 where he is the younger. But the father of such a combination could have told you he has a daughter who was born on any day of the week. So we can only count 7 of these combinations, even though 14 exist.  12 have a boy born on a Tuesday and a boy born on a different day. But the father of such a combination could have told you he has a son who was born on a day of the week other than Tuesday. So we can only count 6 of these combinations, even though 12 exist.  1 has two boys born on a Tuesday. The father of this combination could not have said something else.  So the answer is (6+1)/(7+6+1)=7/14=1/2. You get the incorrect answer if you count all of the combinations that exist, (12+1)/(14+12+1)=13/27. That can only be the correct answer only the man said yes to the question “Is one of your children a boy born on a Tuesday?”          #49  wow   July 20, 2012    Jeff, stuart doesn’t count two boys on tuesday twice.  Though he should have used child rather than son.          #50  Sune Foldager   Denmark July 25, 2012    What I find increadible is that even after the right analysis has been posted over and over, and even in many different varieties. Even after computer simulations have been shown to agree with the correct answer in numerous blogs, that there are still people who refuse to belive the correct answer.  That every blog on this trigger my “crank alert” with posts starting with “sorry, but you’re all wrong”, “there is a fatal flaw” or “epic fail”. What, do you guys really think that you alone have discovered a problem in countless peoples combined reasoning? It’s one thing to not understand a problem, but another to claim everyone is wrong.  To be totally clear, the problem in precise terms is “Out of all pairs of children where at least one is a boy born on a tuesday, what proportion of them consist of two boys?”. We can argue semantics all day, but I believe this is the most natural interpretation of the problem GIVEN that it’s supposed to be a math puzzle and not a casual conversation between friends. In math puzzles, generally all pieces of information should be used for something, and everything not stated should be assumed equally distributed.  Now, I won’t reiterate the many different ways to arrive at the correct 13/27 answer, but I can point to this page (below) which does a nice graphical proof. This may also help to convince people who somehow think “BB should be counted twice”. I don’t know how you can think that two random variables, A and B, each with two outcomes, B and G with 50% for each, can result in anything other than (ordered A then B): BB, GG, BG, GB outcomes. 2 * 2 = 4 (outcomes) after all. and 50% * 50% = 25% (for each outcome).  For those who still don’t believe it, please write a computer simulation. You’ll see that the answer is correct :).  http://mikeschiraldi.blogspot.dk/2011/11/tuesday-boy-problem-in-under-300-words.html  (sorry if I sound a bit arrogant above; I don’t mean any disrespect to people who don’t understand the problem, or interpret it a different way; I just dislike claims to authority by people who aren’t knowledgable in the field of probability.)

I'm wondering if my solution is accurate, as my answer was different than the solution I found:  Probability that there are at least 2 people in the room born on the same day = 1 - (No one was born on the same day) - (Exactly one person was born on the same day)  There are (3 choose 2) different pairs of couples. Each couple has the same birthday as another couple with the chances of 1/7 and different with chances 6/7.

Suppose that no two were born on the same day of the week. $A$ can be born on any day of the week. The probability that $B$ was born on a different day is $\frac67$. (We are of course assuming that the seven days are equally likely, though I believe that in fact this isn't the case.) Given that $A$ and $B$ were born on different days of the week, the probability that $C$ was born on one of the remaining $5$ days of the week is $\frac57$. Thus, the probability that they were born on three different days of the week is $\frac67\cdot\frac57=\frac{30}{49}$, and the probability that at least two of them were born on the same day of the week is $1-\frac{30}{49}=\frac{19}{49}$.  You can check this as follows. There are $7^3=343$ possible ways of assigning days of the week to $A,B$, and $C$. $7\cdot6\cdot5=210$ of these result in $A,B$, and $C$ being assigned different days of the week, so the remaining $343-210=133$ assignments give at least two of the three people the same day of the week. Since all assignments are (assumed to be) equally likely, the probability of getting one of those is $\frac{133}{343}=\frac{19}{49}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 6 '12 at 8:00       Brian M.

Look at the ordered triple $d_1,d_2,d_3$ of days on which $A,B,C$ were born respectively. You have $7^3$ such triples. Now, count the "good" triples. i.e triples in which at least two guys have birthday on the same day: 1) exactly two people have birthday on the same day: choose two days of the week: $\frac{7!}{5!}=42$ (ordered) and choose the two guys that were born on the first day: $\binom{3}{2}=3$. Total of $3\cdot 42=126$ triples. 2) all the guys were born on the same day: choose the day: 7 options. So you got $126+7=133$ good triples out of $7^3$. So the probability is $\frac{133}{7^3}\sim0.39$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 6 '12 at 8:46             answered May 6 '12 at 8:06       Dennis Gulko   13.7k 1 24 51                  Edited. apparently $6\cdot7=42$ and not $21$ :-) – Dennis Gulko  May 6 '12 at 8:47        add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Given that Mrs. Grundy's older child was born on a Monday, what is the probability that both her children were born on Mondays?  Assume that each child was equally likely to be born on any day of the week, and that the two birthdays are independent.   The obvious answer would be $\frac{1}{7}$ since the second child is equal likely to be born on any day of the week.  But I got this problem out of a high-level math book and that would be too easy.  Is $\frac{1}{7}$ the answer?  Or am I missing something really big here?  UPDATE: $\frac{1}{7}$ was the answer and I was correct.  And no, this is not a duplicate.  The other problem has a different part, so whoever marked this question a duplicate was not careful enough to read the whole question.    probability  combinatorics  conditional-expectation     share | cite | improve this question      edited Oct 3 '16 at 0:21             asked Oct 2 '16 at 15:27       Yuna Kun   620 1 11                  Why can't it be $\frac 17$? – suomynonA  Oct 2 '16 at 15:33            For your next questions, please turn to more informative titles, possibly taking as an example the modified version of this one. – Did  Oct 2 '16 at 15:38            @suomynonA  I'm not sure if it is the answer, I'm asking for reassurance. – Yuna Kun  Oct 2 '16 at 15:38         1      Possible duplicate of Mrs. Grundy's Conditional Probability Problem . That is a pretty exact match, including the name of the Mrs., I wonder how it could have not been proposed while you were asking a question. Quite likely there are older duplicates too, I did not check. – Marc van Leeuwen  Oct 2 '16 at 16:05         1      It's not quite an exact match. Here we are asked for the probability given the older child , rather than given at least one child .  However, the two questions are very likely to come from the same problem set.  If so, then the point of the exercise is to recognise the distinction. – Graham Kemp  Oct 2 '16 at 16:16         |  show 1 more comment          3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote  accepted      The obvious answer is the right one.  To see this formally, let $Y$ be the event that the younger child was born on Monday. Let $O$ be the event that the older child was born on Monday. We are interested in the probability of $Y \cap O$, that both children were born on Monday, given $O$. Using the definition of conditional probability and independence we have  $$P(Y \cap O \mid O) = \frac{P(Y \cap O)}{P(O)} = \frac{P(Y)P(O)}{P(O)} = P(Y) = 1/7$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 2 '16 at 15:54             answered Oct 2 '16 at 15:48       aduh   3,348 2 10 33              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      If the older child is born on a monday, this means Mrs. Grundy lived for, lets say, X days after that monday.  If the X is an exact multiplication of 7, this means Mrs. Grundy lived same amount of each day (x/7 mondays, x/7 sundays etc.) to have second child. Then the answer is 1/7.  However, if X is not an exact multiplication of 7, this means Mrs. Grundy did not have her days in equal amounts, so that the answer is not 1/7.  Lets calculate the probability for each day and combine them,  $ \dfrac{1}{7}\dfrac{X/7}{X} + \dfrac{6}{7} \dfrac{floor(X/7)}{X}  $  Equation above means that its 1/7 chance for Mrs. Grundy to start having kids, in that case, probability is 1/7, but for other 6 days, it is less than 1/7. 'floor' means round down, it will give the amount of monday's in Mrs. Grundy's life before giving birth to older child.  We also know that floor(x/7)=x/7 if x is exact multiplication of 7. So the answer is,  $ \dfrac{floor(X/7)}{X} $  which means the exact probability depends on how many days Mrs. Grundy had after the first child. It's maximum is 1/7 and minimum is 1/13.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 2 '16 at 16:00       VolkanOzcan   152 5              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The answer to this depends how you want to interpret the question. The most basic answer would be $\frac{1}{7}$ and this assumes that the birth of the $2$ children are independent (i.e they don't rely on each other). If you want to be a bit more accurate, you can consider the cases that Mrs Grundy has twins. This would mean (unless we're being really pedantic) that the $2$ children will be born on the same day of the week. This would mean that the days on which her children are born are not independent. According to google roughly $3$% of births result in twins. Let  $A = \{\text{Event Mrs G has twins and they're both born on a Monday}\}$, $B = \{\text{Event Mrs G does not have twins and they're both born on a Monday}\}$ and $C = \{\text{Event Mrs G has at least one child born on a Monday}\}$.  Hence if we take this into account we get the probability $P$ that Mrs G has $2$ children born on a Monday to be
\begin{align*}
P &= \mathbb{P}((A \cup B)|C)\\
&=\mathbb{P}(A|C)+\mathbb{P}(B|C)\\
&=\frac{\mathbb{P}(A\cap C)}{\mathbb{P}(C)} + \frac{\mathbb{P}(B\cap C)}{\mathbb{P}(C)}\\
&=\frac{\frac{3}{100}\cdot\frac{1}{7}}{1-((\frac{3}{100}\cdot \frac{6}{7})+(\frac{97}{100}\cdot(\frac{6}{7})^2)} + \frac{\frac{97}{100} \cdot (\frac{1}{7})^2}{1-((\frac{3}{100}\cdot \frac{6}{7})+(\frac{97}{100}\cdot(\frac{6}{7})^2)}\\
&=\frac{59}{641}
\end{align*}
Note I used independence of $A$ and $B$ in the second equality. Hope this helps and you find it an interesting approach to your problem!     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 2 '16 at 17:09       Zestylemonzi   3,358 7 15              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

[duplicate]         up vote  9  down vote  favorite  5       This question already has an answer here:    Boy Born on a Tuesday - is it just a language trick?  9 answers     I've most recently read about the Tuesday Boy Problem via twitter and I, as probably most other people, was sure that the probability has to be 1/2. After having read through a lot of solutions which were not identical at all, I've come to the conclusion that $P = \frac{13}{27}$ sounds the most reasonable. The corresponding argument was as follows:  Say the older child is the boy born on Tuesday. Then, if the younger child is female, there are seven possibilities and analogous if the younger child is male. In case the younger child is the boy born on Tuesday, for an older daughter, again there are seven possibilities, but for an older son, there are only six, because the case that the older son was born on Tuesday has already been counted. Thus,  $$P = \frac{6+7}{6+7+7+7} = \frac{13}{27}. $$  My first question is: Is this the correct solution? I've found other websites giving different solutions, however I could never agree with any of those.  In case this is the correct solution: Why does the probability change when the father specifies the birthday of a son? (does it actually change? A lot of answers/posts stated that the statement does matter) What I mean is: It is clear that (in case he has a son) his son is born on some day of the week. I could replace Tuesday with any day of the week and the probability would be the same. Say the father would have stated:   I have two children. (At least) One of them is a son.   Then, without loss of generality, we could say that this son is born on a Tuesday and again we would have $P = \frac{13}{27}$. But looking at an equivalent (?) problem, we get a completely different probability: Let's toss two coins consecutively and say heads is equivalent to "son" and tails to "daughter". Then, if we know that we tossed at least one heads, if it was the first tossed coin, the probability for another heads is 1/2. If the second coin was heads, then we can only take the case in account where the first coin was tails. So the probability for two heads is $P = \frac{1}{3}$.  So my second (actually third) question is: Where did I go wrong?  Lastly I want to ask (as my knowledge in probability/statistics is limited to what I have been taught in high school) whether the argument which gives $P=\frac{13}{27}$ for the original Tuesday Birthday Problem already takes the possibility of twins in consideration. Can it be regarded as a special case of two boys both born on Tuesday (I ask because in every argument leading to this probability there was a distinction between older child = boy vs. younger child = boy)?

Specifically, it depends on what the speaker would say if he had a different set of children. Look at the three scenarios provided by Tanya Khovanova: in one of them the correct answer is $1/2$, in another it’s $1/3$, and in the third it’s $13/27$. In particular, if you assume that the speaker was randomly chosen from the pool of all men who could honestly say ‘I have two children, and one is a son born on a Tuesday’, $13/27$ is the right answer.  If the man says simply ‘I have two children, at least one of whom is a son’, the probability that the other child is a boy again depends on the sample space $-$ on the assumptions made about how the speaker was chosen. If he was chosen at random from the pool of all men who could honestly say ‘I have two children, and one is a son born on a Tuesday’, but simply made the weaker statement ‘I have two children, at least one of whom is a son’, the correct answer is $13/27$, as before. If, however, he was chosen at random from the pool of all men who could honestly say ‘I have two children, at least one of whom is a son’, the correct answer is $1/3$. And if he was picked at random from the pool of all fathers of two children and told you the sex of one of his children picked at random, then the correct answer is $1/2$. (These are, in reverse order, Tanya Khovanova’s three scenarios, modified for the revised statement by the father.)  These are bad puzzles, in the sense that they can’t be answered without making assumptions that go beyond what’s actually stated in the problem. Thus, there really is no single right answer. Rather, there are several answers that are right for different background assumptions.  For your final question, note that even with twins you normally have an elder and a younger child, even if it’s only by a very small time interval, so the elder/younger argument still works (in the settings in which it’s the appropriate interpretation).     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 1 '11 at 17:54       Brian M.

So let's say we always knew the father has two children, and he made the statement "One is a son born on a Tuesday".  Now assume we gave the man a list with the 14 statements "one is a son born on a monday", "one is a son born on a tuesday", ..., "one is a girl born on a saturday", "one is a girl born on a sunday". And we asked him to read the first statement on the list that is true. Or the last statement on the list that is true. Or pick random statements from the list until he finds a true one, and read that.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 29 '14 at 14:45       gnasher729   5,753 9 28              add a comment |       Not the answer you're looking for?

One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?   The claim was that it is not actually a mathematical problem and it is only a language problem.   If one wanted to restate this problem formally the obvious way would be like so:  Definition : Sex is defined as an element of the set $\\{\text{boy},\text{girl}\\}$.  Definition : Birthday is defined as an element of the set $\\{\text{Monday},\text{Tuesday},\text{Wednesday},\text{Thursday},\text{Friday},\text{Saturday},\text{Sunday}\\}$  Definition : A Child is defined to be an ordered pair: (sex $\times$ birthday).  Let $(x,y)$ be a pair of children,  Define an auxiliary predicate $H(s,b) :\\!\\!\iff s = \text{boy} \text{ and } b = \text{Tuesday}$.  Calculate $P(x \text{ is a boy and } y \text{ is a boy}|H(x) \text{ or } H(y))$  I don't see any other sensible way to formalize this question.   To actually solve this problem now requires no thought (infact it is thinking which leads us to guess incorrect answers), we just compute  $$
\begin{align*}
& P(x \text{ is a boy and } y \text{ is a boy}|H(x) \text{ or } H(y)) \\\\
=& \frac{P(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }(H(x)\text{ or }H(y)))}
        {P(H(x)\text{ or }H(y))} \\\\
=& \frac{P((x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }H(x))\text{ or }(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }H(y)))}
        {P(H(x)) + P(H(y)) - P(H(x))P(H(y))} \\\\
=& \frac{\begin{align*} &P(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }x\text{ born on Tuesday}) \\\\
   + &P(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ born on Tuesday}) \\\\
   - &P(x\text{ is a boy and }y\text{ is a boy and }x\text{ born on Tuesday and }y\text{ born on Tuesday}) \\\\
   \end{align*}}
   {P(H(x)) + P(H(y)) - P(H(x))P(H(y))} \\\\
=& \frac{1/2 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 1/7 + 1/2 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 1/7 - 1/2 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 1/7 \cdot 1/7}
        {1/2 \cdot 1/7 + 1/2 \cdot 1/7 - 1/2 \cdot 1/7 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 1/7} \\\\
=& 13/27
\end{align*}

For example, what is the strategy of the guy telling you about his family? If he always mentions a boy first and not a daughter, we get one probability; if he talks about the sex of the first born child, we get a different probability. Your calculation makes a choice in this issue - you choose the version of "if the father has a boy and a girl, he'll mention the boy".  What I'm aiming to is this: the question is not well-defined mathematically. It has several possible interpretations, and as such the "problem" here is indeed of the language; or more correctly, the fact that a simple statement in English does not convey enough information to specify the precise model for the problem.  Let's look at a simplified version without days. The probability space for the make-up of the family is {BB, GB, BG, GG} (GB means "an older girl and a small boy", etc). We want to know what is $P(BB|A)$ where A is determined by the way we interpret the statement about the boys. Now let's look at different possible interpretations.  1) If there is a boy in the family, the statement will mention him. In this case A={BB,BG,GB} and so the probability is $1/3$.  2) If there is a girl in the family, the statement will mention her. In this case, since the statement talked about a boy, there are NO girls in the family. So A={BB} and so the probability is 1.  3) The statement talks about the sex of the firstborn. In this case A={BB,BG} and so the probability is $1/2$.  The bottom line: The statement about the family looks "constant" to us, but it must be looked as a function from the random state of the family - and there are several different possible functions, from which you must choose one otherwise no probabilistic analysis of the situation will make sense.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 11 '10 at 6:39             answered Sep 11 '10 at 5:42       Gadi A   11.1k 2 50 94              6      Nope. I'm saying that in order to give a probabilistic meaning to this statement, you need to attach probabilistic assumptions to it. In your case it seems you've chosen the assumption of "if there is a boy, a boy will be given in the statement". Other possible interpretations: "If there is a girl, a girl will be said" (so since a boy was said, there are no girls 100%), and "If there is a boy and a girl, one will be said at random" and "The sex of x is said" and so on. Forget about days - try to do the probability for these cases and see what happens. – Gadi A  Sep 11 '10 at 6:11         6      This is of course correct, but you must also take into account the question of how the statement "I have a boy" comes to be. I've tried to elaborate in my answer. – Gadi A  Sep 11 '10 at 6:40        3      The statement (ignoring the day red herring) is "I have two children. One is a boy." As I said before, this statement should be considered as part of the probabilistic scenario otherwise the problem is simply not well-defined. – Gadi A  Sep 11 '10 at 7:37         5      What I meant was that adding the day does not affect the "strangeness" of the situation. However, I'm not sure if it's the strangeness that interests you. The main point is that it's called "a language problem" because different mathematical interpretations of the same English statement yield different mathematical models, and hence different mathematical results - and so for every intuition about the problem there is a interpretation in which the result is counter-intuitive. – Gadi A  Sep 11 '10 at 11:52        3      Exactly; this is why this question, in its ambiguous phrasing, would make a poor exam question. Since there are several acceptable formulations "from first principles" of this problem. – Gadi A  Sep 15 '10 at 15:45        |  show 22 more comments            up vote  17  down vote      It is actually impossible to have a unique and unambiguous answer to the puzzle without explicitly articulating a probability model for how the information on gender and birthday is generated.  The reason is that (1) for the problem to have a unique answer some random process is required, and (2) the answer is a function of which random model is used.   The problem assumes that a unique probability can be deduced as the answer. This requires that the set of children described is chosen by a random process, otherwise the number of boys is a deterministic quantity and the probability would be 0 or 1 but with no ability to determine which is the case.  More generally one can consider random processes that produce the complete set of information referenced in the problem: choose a parent, then choose what to reveal about the number, gender, and birth days of its children.  The answer depends on which random process is used.  If the Tuesday birth is disclosed only when there are two boys, the probability of two boys is 1.    If Tuesday birth is disclosed only when there is a sister, the probability of two boys is 0.  The answer could be any number between 0 or 1 depending on what process is assumed to produce the data.   There is also a linguistic question of how to interpret "one is a boy born on Tuesday".  It could mean that the number of Tuesday-born males is exactly one, or at least one child.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 13 '10 at 8:58             answered Sep 11 '10 at 8:31       T..   10.3k 2 29 46              6      +1. We have a reasonably standard jargon for specifying simple random processes in English. People come up with "puzzles" like this by exploiting the impreciseness of English for describing more complicated situations. If the person posing the question had directly stated the random process, nobody would be confused. The reason this is a "puzzle" is that it's worded too vaguely to convey the intended meaning.  So @muad: any time someone asks you a probability "puzzle", you should simply press them about exactly what random process they have in mind. Then it will be easy. – Carl Mummert  Sep 12 '10 at 12:07            What you call "a linguistic question" over what "one is a boy born on Tuesday" means is actually the observation that people are capable of misunderstanding even unambiguous language. I do not think this question is about that sort of misunderstanding, and it would be unchanged by substituting "at least one is a boy born on a Tuesday" for the above phrase.

Is atleast one of them a boy who is born on Tuesday? Dave answers Yes.  Dave has two children. I ask him to first choose and fix one child at random, and tell me if it is a boy who was born on Tuesday. Dave answers yes he is a boy born on Tuesday.   For 1st the probability (of both being boys) is 13/27, while for the second the probability is 1/2.  The way in which the question is asked, it's in line with 1st, hence the answer should be 13/27.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 5 '17 at 21:46             answered Sep 11 '10 at 8:35       KalEl   2,334 3 11 21              3      +1 for correct answer.  More specifically, your first example is equivalent to the case where Dave knows the sex/birthdate of both children, while the second example is equivalent to the case where Dave doesn't know the sex/birthdate of both children; so what we have here is yet another question about knowledge-of-knowledge.

In other words if Dave says "I have two children, and at least one of them is a boy born on a Tuesday", the information conveyed by his statement depends on the space of possible ones. (You're assuming that the information conveyed is the content of his statement: and yes, the answer to "if we are given the information that Dave has a boy born on a Tuesday..." is indeed 13/27.)

If the statement were a response to a random experiment where we ask random people if they have a boy born on Tuesday, yes, it would be in line with the 1st. That is certainly not the case here, however. – 6005  Apr 8 '17 at 21:22        2      In my brain, I have an implicit prior distribution over the possible kids someone has and whether they are male or female. Upon hearing they have 2 kids, I update on them having 2 kids. Upon hearing that one of them is a boy, I update not on the fact that at least one is a boy, but rather on the fact that a random child of theirs was a boy -- in other words, mentally, I assume WLOG they are talking about a random child when they make the statement. Thus I get that the other child is equally likely a boy or a girl. "Boy born on tuesday" additionally does not affect it :) – 6005  Apr 8 '17 at 21:25         |  show 4 more comments            up vote  3  down vote      There is always room for misinterpreting a question when one does not fully understand the language in which it is written.

What space does Dave's statement come from? The only way to get the 13/27 answer is to make the unjustified unreasonable assumption that Dave is boy-centric & Tuesday-centric: if he has two sons born on Tue and Sun he will mention Tue; if he has a son & daughter both born on Tue he will mention the son, etc. See [this article](arxiv.org/abs/1102.0173).

But in everyday english, from "there are two fleems, one is a glarp" we all infer that the other is not a glarp.  From "there are two fleems, one is a glarp, which is snibble" we would still infer that the other is not a glarp. Whereas from "there are two fleems, one is a glarp which is snibble" (absence of comma, or when spoken, difference in intonation) we would infer that the other is not a snibble glarp, but it could still be an unsnibble glarp.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 11 '10 at 23:58      anon                  I see what you mean, Whether one interprets "One is ..." to mean "Exactly one (and no more) is ..." or "At least one ...".

It's stated as a fact, thus the probability is 1. Also, it doesn't say " only one boy is born on a Tuesday". But indeed, this could be a language thing.  With 2 children you have the following possible combinations: 1. two girls 2. a boy and a girl 3. a girl and a boy 4. two boys  If at least 1 is a boy we only have to consider the last three combinations. That gives us one in three that both are boys. The error which is often made is to consider 2. and 3. as a single combination.  edit I find it completely counter-intuitive that the outcome is influenced by the day, and I simulated the problem for one million families with 2 kids. And lo and behold, the outcome is 12.99 in 27.

the probability of 7*P(b AND d1) = P(b AND d1) + P(b AND d2) + ... + P(b AND d7) = P((b AND d1) OR (b AND d2) OR ... OR (b AND d7)) = P(b AND (d1 OR d2 OR ... OR d7)) = P(b).  However, the flaw here is that, in reality, P(b AND d1) + P(b AND d2) + ... + P(b AND d7) is NOT equal to P((b AND d1) OR (b AND d2) OR ... OR (b AND d7)). This means that mentioning independent (and one might think irrelevant) information alongside with relevant information actually changes the resulting probabilities.  One interesting consequence: if I say something like
"I have two children. One of them is a boy who was born at 10:24 PM on February 10th,"
The probability that I have two boys is now almost exactly the same as as the probability that I have a girl and a boy. Adding a unique or almost unique piece of information makes the stuff I want to know about the other child independent of the information I have on the first child. If I took this to the extreme and said that I have a firstborn boy, won't know anything additional about the other child.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 11 '10 at 14:36       yrudoy   1,218 11 20                  What is an example of the "... is NOT equal ..."?

This allows you to restate the "probability" question as a "percentage" question, taking idealized percentages.  Consider:   Given a parent randomly selected from the pool of all parents who have two children where at least one of the children is a boy born on Tuesday, what is the probability that both children are boys?   This can be stated as a percentage question:   What percentage of (parents who have two children where at least one of the children is a boy born on Tuesday) have two boys?   By contrast, if the day was a matter of chance (not a restriction on the pool size), we get a different question:   Given a parent randomly selected from the pool of all parents who have two children at least one of whom is a boy, where after the random selection is made we shall be told the day of the week on which the boy was born (if there is only one boy) or if there are two boys we shall be told the day of the week on which a randomly chosen one of the two boys was born, what is the probability that both children are boys if the day we are told is Tuesday?   As you can see, in this setup the "Tuesday" part has absolutely no influence on the selection process, and can be entirely disregarded.  This is what is meant by Wikipedia's statement:   The moral of the story is that these probabilities do not just depend on the known information, but on how that information was obtained.    As a further note, you can't "prove" anything about the "actual" meaning by using computer simulations, because in order to program a computer simulation in the first place you must first disambiguate which scenario you are actually talking about.  So the only thing a computer simulation can "prove" is how the programmer interpreted the question.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 27 '17 at 6:10       Wildcard   2,495 6 26              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .            asked    7 years, 7 months ago      viewed     4,061 times       active    5 months ago           13 votes · comment · stats    Visit Chat      Linked     9   The Tuesday Birthday Problem - why does the probability change when the father specifies the birthday of a son?     1   The man with two boys     292   A challenge by R.

In most years, one's birthday the following year is on the subsequent day of the week, and in that pattern, my birthday next year (2012) it is on a Saturday.  However, due to 2012 being a leap year, my birthday in 2013 will be on Monday - I miss out on having a Sunday birthday.  I quite like having weekend birthdays, so that disappoints me a bit. However it leads me to a question:  Over a reasonable-length life-time, does any given person's number of weekend birthdays even out to an average, or are some people significantly more blessed than others?  If some people do have an advantage in this respect, is there any way mathematical way to work out whether being born on any given day of any given year will confer an advantage? And further, what are the probabilities of being 'lucky' in your number of weekend birthdays.  My guess is that for any given year, on each side of Feb 29th, birthdays on any given day of the week throughout the year will have the same score.  To make it a bit easier, lets say for a 'reasonable length life-time', we mean a fixed length of 80 years (though I for one intend to beat that!). That said, I would also be interested in how the maths change as we vary the life-span.    combinatorics  calendar-computations     share | cite | improve this question      edited Apr 16 '11 at 18:33       Willie Wong   53.2k 8 99 202        asked Feb 12 '11 at 20:30       Spudley   170 2 8                  This isn't really probability, since the day of the week a particular day falls on is not a random event; more combinatorics.

Consider first the situation in the Julian calendar, where there is a leap year every $4$ years without fail.  Suppose you have January 1st on a Monday, in the year immediately after a leap year. When will January 1st again fall on a Monday in the year immediately after a leap year? The pattern is:   M, T, W, R, Sa, Su, M, T, R, F, Sa, Su, T, W, R, F, Su, M, T, W, F, Sa, Su, M, W, R, F, Sa,   and then repeats; that is, a 28 year cycle. So, ignoring the leap year rule for Gregorian calendar, you could check for a period of 84 years (three full cycles).  The situation is similar if your birthday occurs March 1st or later, except that the leap year affects you in position 4 instead of 5; you would have:   M, T, W, F, Sa, Su, M, W, R, F, Sa, M, T, W, R, Sa, Su, M, T, R, F, Sa, Su, T, W, R, F, Su,   and the pattern repeats.  In our putative example, which began on a Monday, we got each day of the week exactly $4$ times; that is, they all occur equally likely. If you chop it off at 80 years, then you'd be one short on four days. Changing the day of the week, or the time of the most recent leap year, would not affect the outcome: it cycles every 28 years.  However, the Gregorian calendar has a slightly different rule for leap years: in the Gregorian calendar, a year is leap year if and only if it is a multiple of $4$ that is not a multiple of $100$, except for the multiples of $400$ (that's why $1900$ was not a leap year, $2000$ was , but $2100$ will not). For someone born before $2016$, assuming a period of $84$ years, this will not matter because we will have a cycle just as above, with leap years every four years. But if you extend the lifetime so that it includes the year $2100$, then you start running into trouble because you skip a leap year.  You can think of the Julian calendar as repeating the pattern of leap years every four years; the Gregorian calendar, on the other hand, has a cycle of 400 years for repeating leap years. Added: And as Ross pointed out, while the Julian calendar has a cycle of 28 years, the Gregorian calendar has a cycle of 400. So you want to check what happens over a period of 400 years.  Over a cycle of 400 years, the number of times a given date (other than February 29) falls on a particular day does change (it's not uniform, like in the Julian calendar). If you start counting on a Monday, over the next 400 years, that date will fall on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday 58 times each, Thursday and Friday 57 times each; and Tuesday and Sunday 56 times each. It's a pretty small difference over a period of 400 years, but there you go.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 12 '11 at 21:53             answered Feb 12 '11 at 21:34       Arturo Magidin   248k 30 550 871                  Aewesome answer.

One person is chosen at random.  What is the probability that the persons birthday is on a Monday in the year 2008. Write the answer as a decimal to two d.p.  Answer in book = 0.14    Attempt ONE   There are 52 Monday's in 1 year so I did 52/3750 = 0.014  WRONG ANSWER   Many attempts later Thinking that there are 52 Monday's in 365  days I did 52/365 = 0.14 because this is the probability of there being a Monday in 1 year. CORRECT ANSWER  BUT I'm not happy.  I just got the answer by not really knowing what I'm doing. Why did I not need to use  the 3750 people value?   What happens if the question asked about the probability of TWO people's birthday being on a Monday? Would the answer be (52/365)×(52/365) = 0.02?   Please help.

Math exercises love to include completely irrelevant information to lead you astray, so as to better prepare you for real world scenarios which are often chock-full of red herrings. For this problem, all that matters is that you pick one person at random from the company. For all intents and purposes, which day of the year a person is born on is completely random. In a more realistic exercise, you might have considered birth rates and holidays and what not to determine the "hot spots" for more births than typical, but that's not needed here...  The second method is correct because any individual person, picked at random, has a 1/365 chance of being born in any given day. Since there are 52 Mondays in 2008, that gives a 52/366 (because 2008 was a leap year) chance of that person being born on a Monday. Because of the error introduced by rounding to two decimal places, 1/7 would have also been an acceptable answer, since there's only seven possible days to choose from. 52/366 is slightly more accurate because that accounts for the fact that some weekdays appear slightly more often than others do in a given calendar year.  Your proposed answer for the scenario in which two people are picked at random is also correct. What day of the week a person is born on is an independent event. One person being born on, say, a Thursday, in no way affects the chance of the other person being born on Monday.

What are the chances? Share share tweet comment email Author: Rhett Allain Rhett Allain dot-physics 12.13.10 11:45 am You say it's your birthday. What are the chances? This weekend was graduation at Southeastern Louisiana University . Congratulations to all the recent graduates. For the opening speech, some interesting facts are listed. Who is the youngest graduate? Who is the oldest. Are there any parent and child graduating together etc... Also announced are any graduates who happen to also be having a birthday. This year there were three such students. What are the chances of this happening? First, take a student. Let me assume that any randomly picked student could have a birthday on any day of the year. So the probability of having a birthday on any particular day is: Of course this assumes it is not a leap year, it also assumes that all days have the same probability. I suspect for a given year, the distributions of births is not evenly spread over the days of the year. Think of babies that are born by inducing labor. How many doctors are going to schedule this on the weekend? So, the question to answer: what is the probability that at least one of the 1300 graduates has a birthday on graduation day? Well, that would be 1 minus the probability that no one has a birthday on that day. What is the probability that a particular student does not have a birthday on graduation day? That would be 354/365. What are the chances that all 1300 graduates have this also? Using this, I can get the probability of at least one student having a birthday as: So, not such a crazy event. Another trick This birthday thing reminds me of one of my favorite tricks. Get a class of students. Surely there will be more than 13 in there. Make a wager: I bet that at least two of you have a birthday in the same month. Students might think there is a trick - and they would be correct. However, they also might think you just have a good chance of being right. You can encourage them to take the bet by saying something like "If I lose, everyone gets an A". Here is the deal. If there are 13 or more students in the class, there MUST at least be two students with the same birth month. Just think. What are the possible cases. Let's say that student 1 has a birthday in January, student two is born in February and so on. The twelve student would be born in December. What about the 13th student? This student would have to be born in some month that is already taken. Bet won. Oh, but what about the other end of the spectrum? What if every student is born in March? Well, thirteen students with the same birth month is more than 2 students with the same birth month. The problem is that it is easy to confuse this question with something like "what are the chances that two students in this class were born in July?" That has some probability that is not 100%.

When the deck is full, this probability is 4/52 (the probability of getting one of 4 aces) times 16/51 (the probability of getting one of 16 kings, queens, jacks, or tens) times 2 (the number of orders in which you could get these cards: ace first, or ace second). \n. 
\nThis comes out to 32/663, or about 4.83%. \n. 
\nOf course, this probability changes as the game progresses: it decreases when any of the tens, jacks, queens, kings, or aces get discarded, but increases when other cards get discarded. This change is unpredictable, but its expected value is 0; this is a complicated concept to explain, but it means that on average, the probability will go up as much as it goes down.\n. 
\nAlso, the probability is still 32/663 at any point in the game if you have no information whatsoever about what cards came up before: if you forgot every card you saw, or if you just joined the game.               Dlmick  265,765 Contributions      What does being listed as probable mean in the NFL?  The NFL has a 'rating' system for injured players that specifies their probability of playing in a game:. 
1) Out - the player will not play   2) Doubtful - 75% chance the player will not play   3) Questionable - 50-50 chance the player will play   4) Probable - 75% chance the player WILL play            What is the probability of two healthy people where one is a carrier being parents to a child born with cystic fibrosis?  If only one person is a carrier of cystic fibrosis than there is no chance of having a child with it. Both parents have to be carriers and even then there is only a 25% chance. If only one carries than there is a 50% chance that their children will carry but will not have cystic fibrosis.

In blackjack what is the probability of being dealt three sevens?  The odds of being dealt three suited sevens in a six-deck game are approximately 63,000 to 1. [Source: Arnold Snyder, "The Big Book of Blackjack" p205]    The odds of being dealt three sevens (not suited) is somewhat worse than 500 to 1 (considering that casinos frequently offer the payout of 500 to 1 for players receiving three unsuited 7s in the "Super Sevens" side bet).

Why the probability is have a specified chance to be selected and why the non probability does not have an equal of being selected?  Probability is the number of occurrences of a specific event divided by the total number of possible events. Suppose you took a multiple choice test with 4 possible answer's A, B, C, D. Only 1 of the 4 choices is correct; so the probability of correct is 1/4 and the probability of incorrect is 3/4. Most of the time the two probabilities will not be the same.               Squirrel Man  234,785 Contributions      What is the probability of being killed by a Pop Tart?  Very low, and for a number of reasons.    If a Pop Tart were to be traveling towards your head, the Pop Tart would have to be going at least 173 mph to break your neck, subsequently being killed. Pop Tarts usually do not travel that fast.    A flying Pop Tart that came directly at any other parts would still result in a very unlikely death, since the rib cage holds the most important organs, and is thus very strong (much stronger than the human neck).    To die from choking on a Pop Tart is also extremely unlikely, because 4,600 deaths occur in the United States out of a population of 307 million people. This is only in the United States; the percentage of choking alone is bigger for the entire world. The 4,600 deaths from choking were also mostly younger kids and infants from small parts, and not from food (which makes it very unlikely for the choking culprit to be a Pop Tart).    Thus, the probability of being killed by a Pop Tart is lower than a calculable percentage due to the vast assortment of things that happen in the world. It is  way below  1%.

Births are not distributed randomly across the year: there are seasonal variations as well as differences between days of the week. Where maternity staff like to celebrate New Year's Eve, there may be fewer people on duty on January 1 and so there may well be fewer births. Unfortunately, comprehensive information on such variations is not available.  If you assume that each day of the year is equally likely, the probability is 1/365. Adjusting for leap years changes that to 1/365.25. Further adjusting for Centuries gives 1/365.2425               Vinginge  3,194 Contributions      Probability of 2 consecutive angles of a square being congruent?

Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      Using probability how do you Calculate your odds of being in a plane crash?  It is quite complicated.  First you need to get the accident rates for the airline on which you are planning to fly. One measure is the number of crashes per million kilometres or million hours of flying.  Next, calculate the distance or number of hours you will be flying. Then one measure of the probability is the ratio of the two corresponding values.   You could refine the calculation by adjusting for the aircraft type. Also, since most crashes happen at take-off or landing, you may want to consider which airports you are flying from and to, including any that you are transiting.

The majority of the world's population does not live in hurricane zones and so for them the probability is 0. For the small part of the world's population who do live in the zone, the mortality rate is low and so the overall probability is extremely low.

Let me give you a simple answer first and two deep answers next.  Simple answer is, assuming that all months have the same number of days (which is very approximately true), 1/12.   If you want a slightly deeper answer, then 31/365 or 31/366 is correct, depending upon whether the year is a normal year or a leap year.   The correct answer, which might be argued as "philosophical", is as follows:    The Gregorian calender, the current standard calender in most of the world, adds a 29th day to February, 97 years out of 400, a closer approximation than once every four years.  This would be implemented by making a leap year every year divisible by 4 unless that year is divisible by 100.  If it is divisible by 100 it would only be a leap year if that year was also divisible by 400.. 
So, in the last millennium, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.  In this millennium, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2900 and 3000 will not be leap years, but 2400 and 2800 will be.  The years that are divisible by 100 but not 400 are known as "exceptional common years".  By this rule, the average number of days per year will be 365 + 1/4 - 1/100 + 1/400 = 365.2425..

There are assumptions in the above answer as well. These are 1. That all days in a year have the equal probability (which is not strictly true, as records of births will be required for verification) 2. The Gregorian calender has been in effect since 1700s. The probability as above will only work for years after the introduction of Gregorian calender.               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability of a mother's first three kids being boys?  It is not possible to give a proper answer to the question because the children's are not independent. Among other things they depend on the parents' genetics and their age and there is no information on either of those factors. Also, the probability of a male child is not 0.5 as it is often naively assumed to be. It is, in fat, around 0.52.  However, if you suspend reality and assume that  . 
the children's genders are independent and . 
the probability of a boy is 1/2     then the answer is (1/2) 3  = 1/8.

February 29 occurs 97 times in 400 years (not once in 4 years).Therefore, there are 97 favourable events out of 146,097 days whichgives a probability of 0.00066 approx.  However, this assumes that birthdays are randomly spread over thecourse of a year. This is certainly not true, and February is "lowseason" for births so the true probability will be lower.               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability of after six girls born the next child being a girl?  There is no simple answer to the question because the children's genders are not independent events. They depend on the parents' ages and their genes. Unfortunately there is no readily available research into the genders of seven or more children to establish the experimental probability for such an outcome.    However, if you assume that they are independent events then, given that the probability of a girl is approx 0.48, then the probability of the seventh child being a girl is 0.48.

The answer depends on how many times the coin is tossed. The probability is zero if the coin is tossed only once!   Making some assumptions and rewording your question as "If I toss a fair coin twice, what is the probability it comes up heads both times" then the probability of it being heads on any given toss is 0.5, and the probability of it being heads on both tosses is 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25.  If you toss it three times and want to know what the probability of it being heads exactly twice is, then the calculation is more complicated, but it comes out to 0.375.

Answer by solver91311(22617)   ( Show Source ): You can put this solution on YOUR website!    All Wednesdays:  There are seven different days in the week, so the probability that one person is born on a given day is .  Since each of the three birthdays is an independent event, the total probability is the product of the three individual probabilities:     Different day of the week:  The probability that the first guy is born on any one of the 7 days in the week is certainty, or 1.  The probability that the second guy was born on a different day is the number of days unused so far, or 6 divided by the number of possible days, or 7.  The probability that the third guy was born on yet a different day is calculated the same way, this time 5 divided by 7.  Again the total probability is the product:     None on Saturday:  6 out of 7 ways not to be born on Saturday, so:     By the way, you get to do your own arithmetic.

A classic example is the Tuesday Birthday Problem (TBP), which a reader has asked me to comment on.  Let’s dive right in by stating the problem:  You meet a man on the street and he says, “I have two children and one is a son born on a Tuesday.”  What is the probability that the other child is also a son?  Seems innocent enough.  But if you’re first inclination is to say that the information about the Tuesday birthday is irrelevant and the answer is just 1/2, then read on.  Let’s try a simpler problem.  Suppose we know that a certain man has two children and we also know that the older one is a boy.  In this case we would say that the probability that the other child is a boy is 1/2.  After all, the sex of one child is independent of the sex of the other child.  That the older child is a boy has no bearing on the sex of the younger child.  Now suppose we know simply that a man has two children and that one of them is a son.  This time we would reason that there is no possibility that the person has two girls.  It follows that the sexes of his two children, ordered from oldest to youngest, are either BB, BG or GB.  Since these cases are equally likely, and since only one of them involves having two boys, we would say the probability that the man has two boys is 1/3.  This is all very cogent, but there are complications we haven’t yet considered.  We shall return to this in a moment.  Now let’s consider the TBP.  Everyone’s first instinct is to think the information about the Tuesday birthday is simply irrelevant.  I mean, seriously, you knew each of the kids was born on some day of the week, so what possible difference could it make that you now know one was born on a Tuesday?  Well, here’s the difference.  Let us first assume that it is the older child who was a son born on a Tuesday.  In this case the second child could be either of two sexes, and could have been born on any of seven days of the week, for a total of 14 possibilities.  Now let’s suppose it is the younger child who was a son born on a Tuesday.  Then the older child could, again, be either of two sexes and could have been born on any of seven days of the week, again providing 14 possibilities.  Added to our original 14 that would seem to give 28 possibilities.  But be careful!  One possibility got counted twice.  Specifically, the one where both children are boys born on Tuesdays.  So really there are only 27 possibilities.  And since 13 of them involve the second child being a boy, the probability would be 13/27.  Were this the end of the story it would still be a fascinating problem.  It is genuinely surprising that the information about the Tuesday birthday could be relevant, but our simple count shows that it is.  Now, we should mention at this point that we are discussing mathematical children who have no existence outside the world of probabilistic brainteasers.  So we’re not worrying about the fact that a disproportionate number of children are born on Mondays and Tuesdays, since C-sections aren’t usually scheduled for the weekends.  We’re also not worrying about twins or triplets.  Or any other sort of “real world” consideration that might occur to you.  But there is a complication we should ponder.  When you are thinking about problems in conditional probability, it is not only the new piece of information that is relevant.  You also must consider how the information was obtained.  The classic example of this is the Monty Hall problem.  (I shall assume you are familiar with this problem.  If you are not, I know a good book you should read.)  The common fallacy is to ignore what we know about how Monty makes decisions.  Thus, when he opens an empty door we tend to think, mistakenly, that we have only learned that that door is empty.  In reality we have learned that Monty, who makes his decisions in a rigidly controlled way, chose to take a certain action.  That has relevance to all of these problems about the two children.  How we assess the probability that the second child is a boy will depend in part on how we learned that one of the children was a boy in the first place.  Peter Winkler explains the significance of this point:  This puzzle confounds people *legitimately*, however, because most of the ways in which you are likely to find out that X has at least one boy contain an implicit bias which changes the answer.  For example, if you happen to meet one of X’s children and it’s a boy, the answer changes to 1/2.  Suppose the puzzle is phrased this way: X says “I have two children and at least one is a boy.” What is the probability that the other is a boy?  Put this way, the puzzle is highly ambiguous. Computer scientists, cryptologists and others who must deal carefully with message-passing know that what counts is not what a person says (even if she is known never to lie) but *under what circumstances would she have said it.*  Here, there is no context and thus no way to know what prompted X to make this statement. Could he instead have said “At least one is a girl”? Could he have said “Both are boys”? Could he have said nothing? If you, the one faced with solving the puzzle, are desperate to disambiguate it, you’d probably have to assume that what really happened was: X (for some reason unconnected with X’s identity) was asked whether it was the case that he had at least one son, and, after being warned–by a judge?–that he had to give a yes-or-no answer, said “yes.” An unlikely scenario, to say the least, but necessary if you want to claim that the solution to the puzzle is 1/3.  This article from Science News helps explain the relevant distinction in these sorts of problems:  Suppose that you already knew that Mr. Smith had two children, and then you meet him on the street with a boy he introduces as his son. In that case, the probability the other child is a son would be 1/2, just as intuition suggests. On the other hand, suppose that you are looking for a male beagle puppy. You want a puppy that has been raised with a sibling for good socialization but you are afraid it will be hard to select just a single puppy from a large litter. So you find a breeder who has exactly two pups and call to confirm that at least one is male. Then the probability that the other is male is 1/3.  In the scenario of Mr. Smith, you’re randomly selecting a child from his two children and then noticing his sex. In the puppy scenario, you’re randomly selecting a two-puppy family with at least one male. (Emphasis added.)  This all takes some getting used to.  If you’re like me, then it just seems obvious to you that knowing the sex of the older child tells you nothing about the sex of the younger.  But the scenario in which you meet one of the children on the street just sounds different.  It sounds more like our initial scenario, in which we know simply that a father has two children and one is a boy.  We should be thinking like this:  Are you being asked to infer the sex of one person based solely on information about someone else?  Or are you being asked to comment on the distribution of sexes among families with multiple children, given information about one of the children?  As the Science News article goes on to note, this has a curious consequence:  The remarkable thing that Foshee’s variation points out is that any piece of information that affects the selection will also affect the probability. If, for example, you selected a family at random among those with two kids, one of whom is a boy who plays the ukulele and wants to become a dancer, the ukulele-playing and dancing ambitions would affect the probabilities about the sex of his sibling.  That still seems weird to me, even though it is precisely the main principle in the Monty Hall problem.  Anyway, Tanya Khovanonva provdes some variations on the TBP to illustrate what is going on:  Now let us consider the first scenario. A father of two children is picked at random. He is instructed to choose a child by flipping a coin. Then he has to provide information about the chosen child in the following format: “I have a son/daughter born on Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun.” If his statement is, “I have a son born on Tuesday,” what is the probability that the second child is also a son?  The probability that a father of two daughters will make such a statement is zero. The probability that a father of differently-gendered children will produce such a statement is 1/14. Indeed, with a probability of 1/2 the son is chosen over the daughter and with a probability of 1/7 Tuesday is the birthday.  The probability that a father of two sons will make this statement is 1/7. Among the fathers with two children, there are twice as many who have a son and a daughter than fathers who have two sons. Plugging these numbers into the formula for calculating the conditional probability will give us a probability of 1/2 for the second child to also be a son.  This fits well with our analysis.  In this scenario a child is selected at random, and then information is provided about his sex and birth day.  We are thus being asked to infer the sex of one child based solely on information about the sex (and birth day) of the other.  Thus, we expect the answer to be 1/2.  In other words, knowing the sex of one child tells us nothing about the sex of the other.  Now let us consider the second scenario. A father of two children is picked at random. If he has two daughters he is sent home and another one picked at random until a father is found who has at least one son. If he has one son, he is instructed to provide information on his son’s day of birth. If he has two sons, he has to choose one at random. His statement will be, “I have a son born on Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun.” If his statement is, “I have a son born on Tuesday,” what is the probability that the second child is also a son?  The probability that a father of differently-gendered children will produce such a statement is 1/7. If he has two sons, the probability will likewise be 1/7. Among the fathers with two children, twice as many have a son and a daughter as have two sons. Plugging these numbers into the formula for calculating the conditional probability gives us a probability of 1/3 for the second child to also be a son.  In this scenario our focus has shifted to the distribution of sexes in a family with two children.  Thus, the knowledge that there is at least one boy is relevant.  But given the procedure we employed in deciding who to ask, the day of the week on which the boy is born is not relevant to the distribution of sexes.  Thus, we get precisely the 1/3 answer we discussed earlier.  Now let us consider the third scenario. A father of two children is picked at random. If he doesn’t have a son who is born on Tuesday, he is sent home and another is picked at random until one who has a son that was born on Tuesday is found. He is instructed to tell you, “I have a son born on Tuesday.” What is the probability that the second child is also a son?  The probability that a father of two daughters will have a son born on Tuesday is zero. The probability that a father of differently-gendered children will have a son who is born on Tuesday is 1/7. The probability that a father of two sons will have a son born on Tuesday is 13/49. Among the fathers with two children, twice as many have a son and a daughter than two sons. Plugging these numbers into the formula for calculating the conditional probability will give us a probability of 13/27 for the second child to also be a son.  And here it was built into our selection procedure that we are only surveying families with two children, with the added assumption that one of them is a boy born on Tuesday. If you surveyed all such families, you would find that roughly 13/27 of them have two boys.  If you read the Science News article I linked to, you will find that this problem was raised at the Ninth Gathering for Gardner, a conference held biennially in honor of Martin Gardner, in Atlanta.  As it happens, I was at that conference, as was Tanya.  We discussed this problem at length.  My initial reaction was that it should be irrelevant that one child was born on a Tuesday.  But then, thinking that the problem would not have been raised if the obvious answer were correct, I managed to enumerate the sample space and came up with 13/27.  I was pleased with myself, but Tanya gave me an earful about unwarranted assumptions.  She was right, of course.  On the other hand, as I noted in the BMHB (that’s the big Monty Hall book), and as I suggested to Tanya at the conference, there really does come a time when the hair-splitting must stop, unless we are specifically trying to drive people insane with these problems!

A father of two children is picked at random. If he doesn’t have a son, he is sent home and another is picked at random until one who has a son is found. He is instructed to tell you, “I have a son born on whatever-day-of-the-week one of his sons was born.”  It seems to me impossible to distinguish these scenarios, in how the problem is first posed. The assumption to the counting argument is that the right set to consider is all men with two children including a son born on Tuesday, rather than all men including a son, born on some day of the week.          #4  Another Matt   November 8, 2011    There’s another complication in the wording, where in normal speech the question could be understood as:  ‘You meet a man on the street and he says, “I have two children and [only] one is a son born on a Tuesday.” What is the probability that the other child is also a son?’  Or ‘I have two children and one is a son born on a Tuesday [and the other is not].’  Understood this way, it would eliminate completely the two boys born on Tuesday scenario, which would make it even less likely that the other was a son (12/26)  Imagine I said, “I have two dogs. One of them is a poodle.” In everyday conversation this means that I have one poodle and one of some other breed because I’m assumed to be trying to convey information clearly and efficiently, and I would just say “both are poodles” rather than “one is a poodle and the other is a poodle” if indeed I had two poodles.  The problem with the TBP is that a question is posed after the informative statement. If I said instead, “I have two dogs. One of them is a poodle. What do you think the other is?” The way you go about answering that question has a lot to do with whether or not you have reason to believe I’m trying to trick you.  A lot of punks on the playground exploit ambiguities in language to win bets.          #5  John Jacob Lyons   November 9, 2011    An intriguing problem Jason but, as far as I know, it is only of academic interest. No jury has ever been fooled into a ‘guilty’ verdict because of the fallacy, for example. This is not so for the ‘Prosecutor’s Fallacy’. This has certainly caused several appalling miscarriages of justice in UK courts. On these occasions, innocent mothers have been found guilty of murder after a so-called ‘expert witness’ (falsely) told the court that the probability of two cot-deaths in one family was about 73 million to 1. The case of Sally Clark several years ago was a well-known, and tragic, example.  The fallacy arises when the (irrelevant) ‘conditional probability of the occurrence of the event(s) assuming innocence’ is confused with the (relevant) ‘conditional probability of innocence given the happening of the event(s)’.  Lack of knowledge of probability theory can cause very rough justice in courts of law.          #6  Wow   November 9, 2011    There isn’t anything saying that ONLY one is a Son born on Tuesday, though.  Like the old gambler joke: I have two pair: two pairs of Aces.  This is somewhat different than the Monty Haul proposition (IIRC the name), where you’re allowed to change your mind after selecting which of three doors you’re going choose a prize behind when after your choice, one of the dud doors is revealed as empty of a prize.  Should you change?  Answer: yes.          #7  Another Matt   November 9, 2011    “There isn’t anything saying that ONLY one is a Son born on Tuesday, though.”  Not in the words themselves, but in the information the words are assumed to imply in everyday conversation. If I see someone on the street that I haven’t seen in a decade, and I say “how the hell are ya?!” and she says “I’m great! I have four kids now, and one of them is a girl!” — I just have to assume that the other three are boys because nobody ever says “one of them is a girl, and one of the remaining three is a girl, and one of the remaining two is a girl, and the yet unenumerated child is a boy.”  It’s why we have the phrase “at least.” If the original problem were phrased “I have two children. At least one of them is a son born on a Tuesday.” then there would be no ambiguity of meaning.  It’s really the same problem with inclusive and exclusive OR, isn’t it? — it’s all about context. If I’m at an amusement park and I tell my child, “You can have ice cream or a funnel cake.” and he says “ICE CREEEEAAAM,” when he’s done he doesn’t get to say, “I shall have a funnel cake as well, please, for I understood your use of ‘or’ to be in the inclusive sense, dad, and my behavior will not be contrary to the permission you gave if I have ice cream AND a funnel cake. Next time be sure to include ‘but not both,’ dad, if that’s what you really mean.”          #8  Wow   November 9, 2011    “but in the information the words are assumed to imply in everyday conversation”  But in everyday conversation, one child is a son doesn’t say that the second one isn’t a son.  It is more information to say “at least”, but in a society and language where “Hi” is enough to greet someone, where “‘sup” means “What’s up” and all those other places where contraction is used to reduce information, missing “at least” isn’t providing any information.  And you’re right: it does depend on context. The context being here “lets trick you into giving the ‘wrong’ answer!”.  The context missing means that we have the words as said. And they don’t say “only one of which is a Son”.          #9  eric   November 9, 2011    Wow: But in everyday conversation, one child is a son doesn’t say that the second one isn’t a son.  I think Another Matt is right, and “one child…” does imply the second child isn’t a son.  Because the speaker has a choice of picking to use the word “one” or “two.”  And if the speaker chooses to use the word “one,” in common speech you can assume she didn’t mean “two.”  In your argument, Wow, every time we hear “one” in such a sentence, we should interpret that to mean “greater than or equal to one.”  But I do not see why “greater than or equal to” should be presumed.  What is the logic behind presuming that is what the person meant?  It seems a lot more verbally sensible to assume that the word “one” typically refers to the number 1 and not the mathematical ‘>=1.          #10  MKR   November 9, 2011    Another Matt makes a good point. Getting the correct solution to a mathematical “story problem”–that is, the solution which would be deemed correct by those who devised the problem–very often depends on a strict interpretation of the words used, which in some cases is at odds with the pragmatics of ordinary conversation. Those who are adept at such problems (call them the skillful) may think that persons who interpret “one of them is a boy” to imply that the other is not a boy (call those who assume this interpretation the unskillful) are misinterpreting the words. But I would say that what is going on is that the skillful are wise to the pragmatic rules that govern story problems while the unskillful simply follow the rules of ordinary conversation.          #11  Wow   November 9, 2011    “Those who are adept at such problems (call them the skillful)”  Or weird.  I’d prefer to call those who pose such problems “Silly”.  After all, 1/2 is right if you take one meaning of the question, therefore you’re right saying 1/2. If you take another meaning of the question, you get a different number. They are all correct, even though they may not be the one that the one posing the question thought was correct.  Which is why it’s a silly question: there’s several right answers. Not just one.          #12  Wow   November 9, 2011    “I think Another Matt is right, and “one child…” does imply the second child isn’t a son.”  If both are sons, then is one child not a son?  No.  “Only one child is a Son” means specifically only one. “At least one” means one or two are sons. “One may be a son” is that there may or may not be at least one son.  If you’re going to put words in there to make the meaning clear, then the question is no longer the one asked, it’s the one you’re answering.  Which means that unless you get that wrong, you’ll be right, even if the one asking thinks you’re wrong.          #13  Another Matt   November 9, 2011    But in everyday conversation, one child is a son doesn’t say that the second one isn’t a son.  I have three bridges for sale. One is a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.          #14  eric   November 9, 2011    Wow:  If you’re going to put words in there to make the meaning clear, then the question is no longer the one asked.  We must mentally put words in there because, without clarification, the sentence can have multiple meanings.  The question is what the speaker was trying to communicate.  Did the speaker intend to communicate 1.0 son or ‘>=1 son?  What I’m saying is absent any contextual clues, the first makes a lot more sense to assume.  Because if she’d wanted to communicate to you that she’d had two sons, she would’ve said ‘two’ instead of ‘one.’  Now, I’ll concede that in some contexts – if a speaker is giving a riddle, playing a verbal joke, or just being an ass – then your interpretation could be warranted.  If you phrase Matt’s scenario as “One logician jokingly said to the other ‘I now have two kids, and one is a son!'” then yeah, you could be right in interpreting 1 to mean ‘>=1.”  But absent those contextual clues, I don’t think your position holds much water.          #15  Wow   November 9, 2011    “We must mentally put words in there because, without clarification, the sentence can have multiple meanings”  And then you no longer have the question asked.  You have the question you decided to answer.  If it doesn’t say that only one son is there, then there is nothing saying there cannot be two sons.  But, like I said several times before, the question is silly because you “have to” add words to the question to get a question.  But the question asked said nothing about there being only one son.          #16  Wow   November 9, 2011    “I have three bridges for sale. One is a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.”  Or, maybe, I have the London Bridge to sell you. 🙂  Assuming words not in evidence is not a good move, in general, if someone is trying to trick you.  There are two bridges crossing the Severn. Just saying “there’s one bridge crossing it, what does the other bridge cross?” isn’t going to mean the second bridge can’t be crossing the Severn too. If I were to tell you there was only one bridge crossing the Severn, then you’d be right (though only because I lied)          #17  eric   November 9, 2011    If it doesn’t say that only one son is there, then there is nothing saying there cannot be two sons.  Yes, there is: the speaker’s choice of the word “one” instead of “two.” You keep ignoring this information as if it doesn’t exist.  Which is, now that I think about it, exactly the sort of error Jason was talking about in his post.          #18  Wow   November 9, 2011    “Yes, there is: the speaker’s choice of the word “one” instead of “two.””  No there isn’t: the lack of “only”.  You need “only one” for there to be only one.  I keep ignoring this information because it DOESN’T exist.  There is no information there saying only one son.  If you wish to point out where it does say “only one”, I shall investigate and maybe recant.          #19  Wow   November 9, 2011    I think the problem might be what my original claim stated has morphed by virtue of misapprehension of what I meant and poor wording allowing it.  I’ll see if I can work out another wording that makes my point clearer.  It may be some time…          #20  Another Matt   November 9, 2011    If you wish to point out where it does say “only one”, I shall investigate and maybe recant.  I think it’s only in the context, and you’ve been making this point yourself by saying things like “Assuming words not in evidence is not a good move, in general, if someone is trying to trick you.” But assuming words not in evidence has to happen all the time for efficient communication in everyday language. There are two contexts in the original problem – one is the one asserted in the problem (viz. that you meet a man on the street and he says something to you – the “everyday language” context) and the other is the statement of the problem itself (the “uh oh a logician might be trying to trick me” context). It’s just an ambiguity that is usually resolved one way normally but possibly another way if there’s a scheme afoot.  Here’s another example. What are the subtle differences between the following? 1) “I flipped a coin 20 times. One flip came up heads.” 2) “I flipped a coin 20 times. One of those times it came up heads.” 3) “I flipped a coin 20 times. It came up heads one of those times. 4) “I flipped a coin 20 times. It came up heads once.” 5) “I flipped a coin 20 times. Of those 20 flips, one was heads.” 6) “I flipped a coin 20 times. One of those times it came up heads. ONE!!”  etc.  There are other contexts where it’s pretty clear that “one” does not necessarily mean “only one” – especially cases where one is learning or teaching.  “I have two coins that together equal 10 cents. One of them is a nickel. What is the other?” This is a deduction problem for kindergarten, and it’s clear that the other one could be a nickel as well; the image is more like “I have a coin in my right hand and one in my left. They equal 10 cents. Pick a hand and I’ll open it, and then you tell me what’s in the other hand. Oooh! My right hand has a nickel; so we know that one of them is a nickel, and remember that together they equal 10 cents. What do you think the other one is?”  This is actually pretty close in context to the original problem – it’s just the “man on the street” scenario that bugs me, and especially if extra words can be added to disambiguate the point at hand.          #21  cwfong   November 9, 2011    Have you considered the reputation of the speaker?  If he’s a notorious trickster and liar, then it’s no longer a math problem – assuming that it ever was.          #22  CRM-114   November 9, 2011    You meet a man on the street and he says, “I have two children and one is a son born on a Tuesday.” What is the probability that you will be correct in your assumptions about why he picked you to tell, and why he chose to tell you this, and why he chose that particular wording?  A true mathematician will convince himself that all his assumptions will all be perfectly correct.          #23  Another Matt   November 9, 2011    A true mathematician will convince himself that all his assumptions will all be perfectly correct.  This is the “no true mathematician” fallacy.          #24  BKsea   November 10, 2011    epic fail! (I think)  When you were enumerating the possibilities, you also have to enumerate the choice of days that the father has when both children are sons.  If they are born on different days, he has 2 choices and there is only a 50% chance he will pick Tuesday. If they are both born on Tuesday, there is a 100% chance he picks Tuesday.  If you correct for this factor, the information about Tuesday becomes irrelevant and order is restored to the universe.          #25  Wow   November 10, 2011    I don’t think it’s an *epic* fail.  However, it does illustrate that if you put words in the question that doesn’t exist in the question to make sense of it, you’re changing the question.  The sons could be twins. He has one son born on the same day as the other.  We leave it there, we don’t add “and the other son is born on the same day as the other other one”.  Two sons. Two tuesdays. One son IS born on Tuesday.          #26  Markk   November 10, 2011    All of these are just ways that show how we map English (or other natural languages) to sets of possible outcomes. You could say things like this are optical illusions for our mind because they are doing similar things – making our heuristic or natural interpretation come in conflict with a not obvious bit in information. Drwing lines around possible outcomes and drawing the possible outcomes often makes things real clear that the ground – the set of possible outcomes being considered, is shifting under you’re feet.          #27  John Jacob Lyons   November 10, 2011    I suggest that a question can only be answered unambiguously if the question itself is unambiguous. It is the responsibility of the person posing the question to ensure that this is the case. Despite this, if the person attempting to answer the question spots an ambiguity he/she can either (a) seek clarification from the poser or (b) provide answers for each of the possible meanings he/she can identify.  With ambiguity, the only exception to the above would be when the answer is the same whichever meaning is intended.          #28  CherryBombSim   November 11, 2011    Thanks. I had never heard of the TBP before. It made me think of this scenario:  A man tells you he has a son who is left-handed, the probability that he has two sons would be close to 1/2. If he tells you he has a son who is right-handed, the probability of two sons is closer to 1/3. Cute.          #29  jahigginbotham   November 11, 2011    #4,  True for poodles, but not other necessarily other animals:  A farmer wanted to control snakes, so he decided to buy a some predators. The only problem was that he didn’t know the plural of “mongoose.” He started the letter: “To whom it may concern, I need two mongeese.” But that didn’t sound right so he tried again: “To whom it may concern, I need two mongooses.” “Is that right?” he thought to himself. Finally, he got an idea: “To whom it may concern, I need one mongoose, and while you’re at it, please send me another one.”          #30  Antaeus Feldspar   November 12, 2011    Now, we should mention at this point that we are discussing mathematical children who have no existence outside the world of probabilistic brainteasers.  Well, this is fine, but…  Here, there is no context and thus no way to know what prompted X to make this statement. Could he instead have said “At least one is a girl”? Could he have said “Both are boys”? Could he have said nothing? If you, the one faced with solving the puzzle, are desperate to disambiguate it, you’d probably have to assume that what really happened was: X (for some reason unconnected with X’s identity) was asked whether it was the case that he had at least one son, and, after being warned–by a judge?–that he had to give a yes-or-no answer, said “yes.”  Why specify that we’re talking about mathematical children and then express such disbelief that the people talking about those mathematical children would be talking mathematically?  Sure, in a more real-world conversation, people are unlikely to say that a descriptor such as “male” or “born on a Tuesday” applies to one of their children when it actually applies to both…  but then for consistency you’d have to consider that C-sections are rarely scheduled for weekends, et cetera.  Anyways, my real problem is this:  That still seems weird to me, even though it is precisely the main principle in the Monty Hall problem.  Ummm…  no, it really isn’t, except in the most general possible terms.  The Two Children Problem, and Tuesday Birthday Problem, both deal with two random events; the Monty Hall problem has only one random event.  In addition, the TCP and TBP both deal with certain combinations that are possible outcomes of the random events but which are prohibited by the problem description (e.g. the two children both being girls); many people believe that this is also true of the MHP but that’s only the case in the misunderstood version of the problem where it’s believed that Monty only opens a door that’s empty by chance, not because he knows which doors are empty and deliberately opens an empty door.  The principle really isn’t the same.          #31  Another Matt   November 13, 2011    …the TCP and TBP both deal with certain combinations that are possible outcomes of the random events but which are prohibited by the problem description (e.g. the two children both being girls); many people believe that this is also true of the MHP but that’s only the case in the misunderstood version of the problem where it’s believed that Monty only opens a door that’s empty by chance, not because he knows which doors are empty and deliberately opens an empty door.  Except that what you’ve just described is where the dispute about sampling with the TBP comes in – how the information about the father was obtained (or equivalently, how the sample pool of fathers was selected, or which population you take the father as representing – the population of all fathers with two children, the population of all fathers with two children and at least one son, or the population of all fathers with two children and at least one son born on tuesday) leads to one of three different probabilities for a two-son father outcome. Here’s a more simple example that will illustrate this more easily:  Say I’ve put each of two six-sided dice in its own separate cup. I turn the cups over, and then I call you on the phone and say “I can tell you that at least one of the dice came up ‘1’. Would you rather bet that I’ve rolled snake-eyes, or that I’ve rolled a ‘7’?”  Your answer to this depend a little on what you think led me to say “at least one of the dice has come up ‘1’.” In the case that I have lifted only one of the cups and it happened to be a 1, then the probability for snake-eyes and for ‘7’ is still just 1/6. But if I’ve looked at both of them, then the possible rolls that will have elicited “at least one has come up 1” is:  1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1  Which leaves a 1/11 probability for snake-eyes and 2/11 for ‘7’. So clearly in that scenario I would do better to bet on 7 than snake-eyes. Since I don’t know how you’ve gotten your information I should bet on 7 each time.  The first scenario – choosing one cup randomly and finding that its die has happened to come up ‘1’ is somewhat analogous to the MHP where Monty really does choose a door at random that happens to be empty. The second scenario where I’ve looked at both dice is analogous to the MHP where Monty knows which doors are empty and always chooses the empty one. In both cases – the MHP and the dice game – you don’t lose anything by assuming Monty has more information.  BTW you could recast the TBP as a dice game where I have four cups, two red and two blue, and I put one “7-sided die” in one red cup and one in a blue cup, and a coin in the other red and blue cup each, and flipped them all over. If I tell you that “at least one of the colors had a coin that came up heads, and at least one heads was associated with a dice-roll of ‘3’ under a cup with the same color,” your answer to the probability that both coins were heads would be determined by how many of the cups (and in what order) I’ve lifted to give you that information. If I lifted two cups of the same color and found that it happened to be “heads, 3” then the probability the coin under the other cup is heads would be 1/2. If I lifted the two coin cups and happened to find one or two heads, and then lifted one of the dice cups with the same color as a heads and happened to find a 3, then the probability they were both heads is 1/3. If I lifted all four cups and found that at least one pairing was “heads, 3” then the probability the other is heads would be the 13/27 from the original problem — all of these are the same as the analysis in Jason’s post.          #32  Wow   November 14, 2011    “people are unlikely to say that a descriptor such as “male” or “born on a Tuesday” applies to one of their children when it actually applies to both”  But then again, people are even less likely to ask the question posed.  And why then did they ask what sex their other child was if they’ve said one is male when “male” applies to both?          #33  Antaeus Feldspar   November 14, 2011    The first scenario – choosing one cup randomly and finding that its die has happened to come up ‘1’ is somewhat analogous to the MHP where Monty really does choose a door at random that happens to be empty. The second scenario where I’ve looked at both dice is analogous to the MHP where Monty knows which doors are empty and always chooses the empty one. In both cases – the MHP and the dice game – you don’t lose anything by assuming Monty has more information.  Only the latter of those is the actual Monty Hall problem, however.  I will stipulate that yes, sometimes people state the problem ambiguously, or even incorrectly, and produce the impression that Monty opening an empty door is simply what happens by chance on this particular occasion – but that isn’t the Monty Hall problem.  Ironically, the door-is-empty-by-chance variant of the MHP (let’s call it the EBCV) has more in common with TBP than MHP does.  MHP has only one meaningful random event, and that is whether the prize winds up after the player’s initial pick a) in the one-member set of “doors that the player picked” or b) in the two-member set of “doors that the player didn’t pick.”  In EBCV, there is the random event of whether the prize wound up behind the door that the player picked, and then the random event of whether the prize wound up behind the door Monty picked out of the two remaining.  Except that since the problem description states that Monty opens an empty door, we discount the two cases where he picks the prize door.  TBP and EBCV have that basic similarity in common, but I really can’t see how one can say that TBP and MHP are working on the same principle.          #34  Another Matt   November 16, 2011    I think we’re disagreeing on the level of generality or abstraction. Here’s the principle from the original post:  …any piece of information that affects the selection will also affect the probability.  It’s pretty clear that this principle is at play in the difference in resulting probabilities between the MHP and your EBCV, and also that the various flavors of TBP with their resulting probability outcomes differ because of this principle. I don’t think it’s meant to extend beyond this level of generality.          #35  Antaeus Feldspar   November 17, 2011     …any piece of information that affects the selection will also affect the probability.  …  It’s pretty clear that this principle is at play in the difference in resulting probabilities between the MHP and your EBCV, and also that the various flavors of TBP with their resulting probability outcomes differ because of this principle. I don’t think it’s meant to extend beyond this level of generality.  Well, if that’s what was meant, I certainly agree that that principle applies to both problems.  I just didn’t think that could be what was meant, because it’s certainly not ‘precise’ (as that adjective is distinguished from ‘accurate’.)          #36  Wow   November 17, 2011    Although in the given TBP there is no apparent choice in telling you the one and only tuesday’s child. You have to put one in there.  Since they’re already admitting that despite having said one is a son, there is a probability that they have TWO sons, why is it not that, despite having said that one is born on Tuesday, there is no possibility that they have TWO children born on Tuesday?  With the doors, Monty KNOWS which doors are empty.  And that information is partially passed on when he opens one door AFTER you chose a door.  And it’s that that makes the MHP solution “you’re better off changing your mind”.  If the questioner were picking the son born on Tuesday, then the chance that their other child is a son is zero.          #37  Another Matt   November 17, 2011    Although in the given TBP there is no apparent choice in telling you the one and only tuesday’s child. You have to put one in there.  Yeah, that was a side issue which gave yet a fourth interpretation of the words. If you look at Tanya Khovanova’s analysis above, or my reframing using dice and coins, you’ll see that what questions elicited the “I have two kids, and one is a boy born on Tuesday” testimony affects the selection criteria for the population of fathers the one in question represents, and thus affects the probability that the other is a son. If you were placing a bet about whether the other child was a boy or a girl, and the probability it was a boy was 1/2, 1/3, or 13/27 (or 12/26 in the side-issue interpretation), if you didn’t know how to interpret the information, or didn’t know how it was gathered, you’d do well to bet on “girl.” In the analogy between MHP and TBP, “Monty KNOWS which doors are empty” is roughly equivalent to “The father KNOWS the sex and the day on which both of his children were born.”          #38  John K.   November 18, 2011    There is a fatal mistake.  You made order important in the case of different sex siblings and order unimportant in the case of same sex siblings.  If order is unimportant there are 2 sets: BB, or BG.  If order is important BB must be counted twice, once for each order of birth, the same as for different sex siblings.  The order important set must then be BB, BB, BG, GB.  The probability of 2 boys remains 2/4 or 1/2.  This mistake goes forward to the days of the week.  Order must be uniformly important or unimportant, so there is no prohibition on which day of the week the other child is born on.  The probability remains ½.          #39  Brent Ashley   November 29, 2011    Introducing the ordering of the children in the 1/3 scenario is a spurious requirement.  One might also introduce the completely irrelevant requirement of handedness, with the unbalanced probability of 1/7 left to 6/7 right, further complicating things, however there was no requirement to do so.          #40  Britton Smith   November 29, 2011    I was also unsure of the point raised in comment 38 about whether the ordering of the children is important and potentially reduces the final probability back to 50%.  So I did the only thing I could think of to ease my mind, and coded up a brute force test of the Tuesday Birthday Problem.  In this, I have a function that generates a child with a random sex and birthday.  It has another function that generates them in pairs and only keeps a pair in which at least one of the children has the desired sex and birthday.  I then do this 1,000,000 times and measure the number of times the second child was the sex we were looking for.  You can download it here: http://paste.yt-project.org/show/1971/ Assuming you have Python installed, you can run it with the following command: python tbp.py  I tested this using a varying number of total matches, and 1,000,000 was well enough converged to be conclusive and I did indeed find that the answer is 13/27.          #41  Britton Smith   November 29, 2011    Silly me, I had a bad character in a comment in the header.  Here it is again with that fixed.  This one also gives a running tally of the percentage as it goes:  http://paste.yt-project.org/show/1972/          #42  Bart   November 30, 2011    Disclaimer – NEVER CARRY A BOMB ON A PLANE (OR ANYWHERE ELSE), the following is only for academic purposes:  You should always carry a bomb on a plane because the chances of TWO people carrying a bomb on a plane are much lower than one person carrying a bomb on a plane.          #43  Richard Wein   December 1, 2011    To those discussing the wording of the original question…  We need to distinguish between real situations and mathematical abstractions. If we were talking about a real situation (i.e. someone actually had the experience described) there would be a fact of the matter as to what the man meant and we could make some judgement (perhaps a probabilistic one) about his meaning, based on all the information available to us.  The case here is not a real situation, but an abstraction invented for its mathematical interest. There is no fact of the matter as to what the man really meant. Mathematicians think about such artificial problems because they are of some theoretical interest. The original problem raises issues that are of mathematical interest, but, having raised the issues, mathematicians’ interest is in exploring those issues, and not necessarily in answering exactly the original question. So they formulate alternative questions which are better suited to clarifying the issues that interest them, as Tanya had done.          #44  John K.   December 2, 2011    @ Britton Smith  My programming skill is rudimentary at best, but having looked at the code you linked to, will your filter correctly handle the case of both siblings having the correct target birthday and sex?  It seems like such a case would incorrectly trigger both if statements.  I have no idea how Python handles sequential if statements, so I apologize if I am incorrect on this.  I must otherwise admit that I am wrong on this.  I am still baffled why not considering order will give a different answer than making order important does, if I am indeed incorrect.  Thank you for putting your programming skills to task on this problem, by the way.          #45  gr8hands   December 6, 2011    Thank you John K. @38 for making the point I was going to make.          #46  JeffJo   December 11, 2011    @Richard Wein  You meet a man on the street and he says, “I have two children. What is the probability my two children share the same gender?” This seems easy; 1/2.  You meet a woman on the street and she says, “One of my two children is a son. What is the probability my two children share the same gender?” By your reply above, it seems you would say 1/3. But what if the woman had said “One of my two children is a daughter?” If this is really just a matter of being a “mathematical abstraction,” your answer would have to be 1/3 also. But if it is 1/3 regardless of what the woman says, how is the problem different than the one about the man?  It isn’t. This fact was first recognized by Joseph Bertrand in 1889 when he published his famous Box Paradox, which I tweaked only by adding a fourth case. Other than that, the two problems are identical. With that fourth case, the “wrong” answer is 1/3, and the “right” one is 1/2. As a “mathematical abstraction,” you have to include the probability of obtaining the information you have, not just the probability that it is true, or else you will get a paradox.          #47  Stuart H   June 29, 2012    Sorry, but no.  The Tuesday is irrelevant.  If the son who was born on a Tuesday is the older son, then there are 2*7 = 14 ways to choose the second son, and 7 of those ways are boys, so its a 50% chance.  If the son who was born on a Tuesday is the younger son, then there are 2*7 = 14 ways to choose the second son, and 7 of those ways are boys, so its a 50% chance.  You DO NOT adsd 14 + 14 to get 28 total configurations (minus 1 for overlap)…rather, you see that the answer is 50% regardless of this unknown information.  Based on the logic of this paper, you could always arbitrarily condition your numbers based on additional information and change the result.  Not the case.          #48  JeffJo   July 20, 2012    And with the third half of the pie … 🙂  Stuart H, your solution is wrong because it counts the family of two boys, both born on a Tuesday, twice. In that family, we do not know if the either son was being specifically referred to.  However, the answer (the number 50%) you give is right, for different reasons.  Of the 196 possible combinations:  169 do not include a boy born on a Tuesday. We can only assume the man you met is truthful, so he can’t be one of these 169 combinations.  14 have a boy born on a Tuesday and a girl;  7 where the boy is the older child, and 7 where he is the younger. But the father of such a combination could have told you he has a daughter who was born on any day of the week. So we can only count 7 of these combinations, even though 14 exist.  12 have a boy born on a Tuesday and a boy born on a different day. But the father of such a combination could have told you he has a son who was born on a day of the week other than Tuesday. So we can only count 6 of these combinations, even though 12 exist.  1 has two boys born on a Tuesday. The father of this combination could not have said something else.  So the answer is (6+1)/(7+6+1)=7/14=1/2. You get the incorrect answer if you count all of the combinations that exist, (12+1)/(14+12+1)=13/27. That can only be the correct answer only the man said yes to the question “Is one of your children a boy born on a Tuesday?”          #49  wow   July 20, 2012    Jeff, stuart doesn’t count two boys on tuesday twice.  Though he should have used child rather than son.          #50  Sune Foldager   Denmark July 25, 2012    What I find increadible is that even after the right analysis has been posted over and over, and even in many different varieties. Even after computer simulations have been shown to agree with the correct answer in numerous blogs, that there are still people who refuse to belive the correct answer.  That every blog on this trigger my “crank alert” with posts starting with “sorry, but you’re all wrong”, “there is a fatal flaw” or “epic fail”. What, do you guys really think that you alone have discovered a problem in countless peoples combined reasoning? It’s one thing to not understand a problem, but another to claim everyone is wrong.  To be totally clear, the problem in precise terms is “Out of all pairs of children where at least one is a boy born on a tuesday, what proportion of them consist of two boys?”. We can argue semantics all day, but I believe this is the most natural interpretation of the problem GIVEN that it’s supposed to be a math puzzle and not a casual conversation between friends. In math puzzles, generally all pieces of information should be used for something, and everything not stated should be assumed equally distributed.  Now, I won’t reiterate the many different ways to arrive at the correct 13/27 answer, but I can point to this page (below) which does a nice graphical proof. This may also help to convince people who somehow think “BB should be counted twice”. I don’t know how you can think that two random variables, A and B, each with two outcomes, B and G with 50% for each, can result in anything other than (ordered A then B): BB, GG, BG, GB outcomes. 2 * 2 = 4 (outcomes) after all. and 50% * 50% = 25% (for each outcome).  For those who still don’t believe it, please write a computer simulation. You’ll see that the answer is correct :).  http://mikeschiraldi.blogspot.dk/2011/11/tuesday-boy-problem-in-under-300-words.html  (sorry if I sound a bit arrogant above; I don’t mean any disrespect to people who don’t understand the problem, or interpret it a different way; I just dislike claims to authority by people who aren’t knowledgable in the field of probability.)
