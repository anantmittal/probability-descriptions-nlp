Randomly sample n = 15 Americans. Let X denote the number in the sample with no health insurance. What is the probability that exactly 3 of the 15 sampled have no health insurance?   Solution. Since n = 15 is small relative to the population of N = 300,000,000 Americans, and all of the other criteria pass muster (two possible outcomes, independent trials, ....), the random variable X can be assumed to follow a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.20. Using the probability mass function for a binomial random variable, the calculation is then relatively straightforward:  \(P(X=3)=\dbinom{15}{3}(0.20)^3 (0.80)^{12}=0.25\)  That is, there is a 25% chance, in sampling 15 random Americans, that we would find exactly 3 that had no health insurance.   What is the probability that at most one of those sampled has no health insurance?   Solution. "At most one" means either 0 or 1 of those sampled have no health insurance. That is, we need to find:  P ( X ≤ 1) = P ( X = 0) + P ( X = 1)   Using the probability mass function for a binomial random variable with n = 15 and p = 0.20, we have:  \(P(X \leq 1)=\dbinom{15}{0}(0.2)^0 (0.8)^{15}+ \dbinom{15}{1}(0.2)^1(0.8)^{14}=0.0352+0.1319=0.167\)  That is, we have a 16.7% chance, in sampling 15 random Americans, that we would find at most one that had no health insurance.   What is the probability that more than seven have no health insurance?   Solution. Yikes! "More than seven" in the sample means 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. As the following picture illustrates, there are two ways that we can calculate P ( X > 7):   We could calculate P ( X > 7) by adding up P ( X = 8),  P ( X = 9), up to P ( X = 15). Alternatively, we could calculate P ( X > 7) by finding P ( X ≤ 7) and subtracting it from 1. But to find P ( X ≤ 7), we'd still have to add up P ( X = 0),  P ( X = 1), up to P ( X = 7). Either way, it becomes readily apparent that answering this question is going to involve more work than the previous two questions. It would clearly be helpful if we had an alternative to using the binomial p.m.f. to calculate binomial probabilities. The alternative typically used involves cumulative binomial probabilities.   An Aside On Cumulative Probability Distributions      Definition. The function:  F ( x ) = P ( X ≤ x )  is called a cumulative probability distribution . For a discrete random variable X , the cumulative probability distribution F ( x ) is determined by:  \(F(x)=\sum\limits_{m=0}^x f(m)=f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(x)\)      You'll first want to note that the probability mass function, f ( x ), of a discrete random variable X is distinguished from the cumulative probability distribution, F ( x ), of a discrete random variable X by the use of a lowercase f and an uppercase F . That is, the notation f (3) means P ( X = 3), while the notation F (3) means P ( X ≤ 3) .  Now the standard procedure is to report probabilities for a particular distribution as cumulative probabilities, whether in statistical software such as Minitab, a TI-80-something calculator, or in a table like Table II in the back of your textbook. If you take a look at the table, you'll see that it goes on for five pages.  Let's just take a look at the top of the first page of the table in order to get a feel for how the table works:     In summary, to use the table in the back of your textbook, as well as that found in the back of most probability textbooks, to find cumulative binomial probabilities, do the following:   Find n , the number in the sample, in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p , the probability of success .  Find the x in the second column on the left for which you want to find F ( x ) = P ( X ≤ x ).   Let's try it out on our health insurance example.  Example  Again, by some estimates, twenty-percent (20%) of Americans have no health insurance. Randomly sample n = 15 Americans. Let X denote the number in the sample with no health insurance. Use the cumulative binomial probability table in the back of your book to find the probability that at most 1 of the 15 sampled has no health insurance.   Solution. The probability that at most 1 has no health insurance can be written as P ( X ≤ 1). To find P ( X ≤ 1) using the binomial table, we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 1 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (1) = P ( X ≤ 1).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 1) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  We've used the cumulative binomial probability table to determine that the probability that at most 1 of the 15 sampled has no health insurance is 0.1671. For kicks, since it wouldn't take a lot of work in this case, you might want to verify that you'd get the same answer using the binomial p.m.f.   What is the probability that more than 7 have no health insurance?   Solution. As we determined previously, we can calculate P ( X > 7) by finding P ( X ≤ 7) and subtracting it from 1:   The good news is that the cumulative binomial probability table makes it easy to determine P ( X ≤ 7). To find P ( X ≤ 7) using the binomial table, we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 7 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (7) = P ( X ≤ 7).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 7) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that P ( X ≤ 7) = 0.9958. Therefore:  P ( X > 7) = 1 − 0.9958 = 0.0042  That is, the probability that more than 7 in a random sample of 15 would have no health insurance is 0.0042.   What is the probability that exactly 3 have no health insurance?   Solution. We can calculate P ( X = 3) by finding P ( X ≤ 2) and subtracting it from P ( X ≤ 3) , as illustrated here:    To find P ( X ≤ 2) and P ( X ≤ 3) using the binomial table, we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 3 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (3) = P ( X ≤ 3). And, find th e 2 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (2) = P ( X ≤ 2).   Now, all we need to do is (1) read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 3) row intersect, and (2) read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 2) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?   The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that finding P ( X ≤ 3) = 0.6482 and P ( X ≤ 2) = 0.3980. Therefore:  P ( X = 3) = P ( X ≤ 3) − P ( X ≤ 2) = 0.6482 − 0.3980 = 0.2502  That is, there is about a 25% chance that exactly 3 people in a random sample of 15 would have no health insurance. Again, for kicks, since it wouldn't take a lot of work in this case, you might want to verify that you'd get the same answer using the binomial p.m.f.   What is the probability that at least 1 has no health insurance?   Solution. We can calculate P ( X ≥ 1) by finding P ( X ≤ 0) and subtracting it from 1, as illustrated here:    To find P ( X ≤ 0) using the binomial table, we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 0 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (0) = P ( X ≤ 0).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 0) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that P ( X ≤ 0) = 0.0352. Therefore:  P ( X ≥ 1) = 1 − 0.0352 = 0.9648  That is, the probability that at least one person in a random sample of 15 would have no health insurance is 0.9648.   What is the probability that fewer than 5 have no health insurance?   Solution. "Fewer than 5" means 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. That is, P ( X < 5) = P ( X ≤ 4) , and P ( X ≤ 4) can be readily found using the cumulative binomial table. To find P ( X ≤ 4) , we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 4 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (4) = P ( X ≤ 4).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 4) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that P ( X ≤ 4) = 0.8358. That is, the probability that fewer than 5 people in a random sample of 15 would have no health insurance is 0.8358.   We have now taken a look at an example involving all of the possible scenarios... at most x , more than x , exactly x , at least x , and f ewer than x ... of the kinds of binomial probabilities that you might need to find. Oops! Have you noticed that p , the probability of success, in the binomial table in the back of the book only goes up to 0.50. What happens if your p equals 0.60 or 0.70? All you need to do in that case is turn the problem on its head! For example, suppose you have n = 10 and p = 0.60, and you are looking for the probability of at most 3 successes. Just change the definition of a success into a failure, and vice versa! That is, finding the probability of at most 3 successes is equivalent to 7 or more failures with the probability of a failure being 0.40. Shall we make this more concrete by looking at a specific example?  Example  Many utility companies promote energy conservation by offering discount rates to consumers who keep their energy usage below certain established subsidy standards. A recent EPA report notes that 70% of the island residents of Puerto Rico have reduced their electricity usage sufficiently to qualify for discounted rates. If ten residential subscribers are randomly selected from San Juan, Puerto Rico, what is the probability that at least four qualify for the favorable rates?   Solution. If we let X denote the number of subscribers who qualify for favorable rates, then X is a binomial random variable with n = 10 and p = 0.70. And, if we let Y denote the number of subscribers who don't qualify for favorable rates, then Y , which equals 10 − X , is a binomial random variable with n = 10 and q = 1 − p = 0.30. We are interested in finding P ( X ≥ 4). We can't use the cumulative binomial tables, because they only go up to p = 0.50. The good news is that we can rewrite P ( X ≥ 4) as a probability statement in terms of Y :  P ( X ≥ 4) = P (− X ≤ −4) = P (10 − X ≤ 10 − 4) = P ( Y ≤ 6)  Now it's just a matter of looking up the probability in the right place on our cumulative binomial table. To find P ( Y ≤ 6) , we:   Find n = 10 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.30 .  Find the 6 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (6) = P ( Y ≤ 6).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.30 column and the ( n = 10, y = 6) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that P ( Y ≤ 6) = P ( X ≥ 4) = 0.9894. That is, the probability that at least four people in a random sample of ten would qualify for favorable rates is 0.9894.   If you are in need of calculating binomial probabilities for more specific probabilities of success ( p ), such as 0.37 or 0.61, you can use statistical software, such as Minitab, to determine the cumulative binomial probabilities. You can then still use the methods illustrated here on this page to find the specific probabilities (more than x , fewer than x , ...) that you need.    ‹ Is X Binomial?  up  Effect of n and p on Shape ›      Printer-friendly version               Navigation    Start Here!

Cumulative
        probabilities provide, for each value x , the
        probability of a result less than or equal to X ,
        P[ X <= x ]. ( <= is "less than
        or equal to." Don't blame me. . .call Netscape &
        Microsoft.)   Example 1  Here's the probability distribution for a

        (In efficient English "less than or equal to"
        is often written "at most" or "no more
        than." These three phrases have the same meaning.)
        For example   P[ X <= 1 ] = 0.1  P[ X <= 2 ] = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3  P[ X <= 3 ] = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.7  P[ X <= 4 ] = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1   These probabilities can be tabled    x  P[ X <= x ]    1  0.1    2  0.3    3  0.7    4  1.0     Example 2  Suppose that P[ X <= 3 ] = 0.65, P[ X  <= 4 ] = 0.80 and no values between 3 and 4 are
        possible. Then P[ X = 4 ] = 0.80 - 0.65 = 0.15.
        So, to compute f(x) , take   f(x) = P[ X <= x ] - P[ X

        If x is already the smallest value then   f(x) = P[ X  <=x ].   Suppose the number of finish flaws on an automobile

        information is in the table-what the table
        "means"-and to think about the question, than
        it is to try to memorize 5 different strategies for
        handling these cases.There is an "easy" (if
        tedious) method for recovering f(x) -from each
        cumulative probability subtract its predecessor. For this

        to the questions above. Whichever way you do it, your
        results should be the same.   Do you understand it? If so, perhaps you'd like to try
        the worksheet on
        this topic?             Random Variables A random variable X discrete continuous Discrete Random Variables discrete random variable The probability distribution ( Definitions taken from Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 ) Suppose a random variable X may take k different 
values, with the probability that X = x i defined to be P(X = x i ) = p i .  The probabilities p i must satisfy the following: 1: 0 < p i  < 1 for each i 2: p 1 + p 2 + ... + p k = 1.   Example  Suppose a variable X can take the values 1, 2, 3, or 4. The probabilities associated with each outcome are described by the
following table: Outcome 	1	2	3	4
	Probability	0.1	0.3	0.4	0.2 The probability that X is equal to 2 or 3 is the sum of the two
probabilities: P(X = 2 or X = 3) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 
0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7.  Similarly, the probability that X is greater 
than 1 is equal to 1 - P(X = 1) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9, by 
the complement rule . This distribution may also be described by the probability
histogram cumulative 
distribution function X x x ( Definition taken from Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 )  Example  The cumulative distribution function for the above probability 
distribution is calculated as follows: The probability that X is less than or equal to 1 is 0.1, the probability that X is less than or equal to 2 is 0.1+0.3 = 0.4, the probability that X is less than or equal to 3 is 0.1+0.3+0.4 = 0.8, 
and the probability that X is less than or equal to 4 is 0.1+0.3+0.4+0.2 = 1. The probability histogram for the cumulative distribution of this 
random variable is shown to the right:  Continuous Random Variables A continuous random variable is one which takes an 
infinite number of possible values. Continuous random variables are 
usually measurements. Examples include height, weight, the amount of 
sugar in an orange, the time required to run a mile. ( Definition taken from Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 ) A continuous random variable is not defined at specific values.  Instead, 
it is defined over an interval of values, and is represented by 
the area under a curve integral Suppose a random variable X may take all values over an interval of
real numbers.  Then the probability that X is in the 
set of outcomes A, P(A) , is defined to be the area above A and
under a curve.  The curve, which represents a function p(x) , must 
satisfy the following: 1: The curve has no negative values (p(x) > 0 for all x) 2: The total area under the curve is equal to 1.  A curve meeting these requirements is known as a density curve .   The Uniform Distribution A random number generator acting over an interval of numbers (a,b) has a continuous distribution.  Since any interval of numbers of equal width
has an equal probability of being observed, the curve describing the
distribution is a rectangle, with constant height across the interval
and 0 height elsewhere.  Since the area under the curve must be equal to 1,
the length of the interval determines the height of the curve. The following graphs plot the density curves for random number generators
over the intervals (4,5) (top left), (2,6) (top right), (5,5.5) (lower left),
and (3,5) (lower right).  The distributions corresponding to these curves are
known as uniform distributions .   Consider the uniform random variable X defined on the interval (2,6).  Since the interval
has width = 4, the curve has height = 0.25 over the interval and 0 elsewhere.  The probability
that X is less than or equal to 5 is the area between 2 and 5, or (5-2)*0.25 = 0.75.  
The probability that X is greater than 3 but less than 4 is the area between 3 and 4,
(4-3)*0.25 = 0.25.  To find that probability that X is less than 3 or greater than
5, add the two probabilities: P(X < 3 and X > 5) = P(X < 3) + P(X > 5) = (3-2)*0.25 +
(6-5)*0.25 = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5. The uniform distribution is often used to simulate data.  Suppose you would like to simulate data
for 10 rolls of a regular 6-sided die.  Using the MINITAB "RAND" command with the "UNIF" subcommand
generates 10 numbers in the interval (0,6): MTB > RAND 10 c2;
SUBC> unif 0 6. Assign the discrete random variable X to the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as follows: if 0<X<1, X=1 if 1<X<2, X=2 if 2<X<3, X=3 if 3<X<4, X=4 if 4<X<5, X=5 if X>5, X=6. Use the generated MINITAB data to assign X to a value for each roll of the die: Uniform Data		X Value

The area under the curve is not easy to calculate for a normal random variable X with
mean and standard deviation .  However, tables (and computer functions) are 
available for the standard random variable Z , which is 
computed from X by subtracting and dividing by .  
All of the rules of probability apply to the normal distribution.

The standard normal distribution is centered at zero and the degree to which a given measurement deviates from the mean is given by the standard deviation. For the standard normal distribution, 68% of the observations lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean; 95% lie within two standard deviation of the mean; and 99.9% lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. To this point, we have been using "X" to denote the variable of interest (e.g., X=BMI, X=height, X=weight). However, when using a standard normal distribution, we will use "Z" to refer to a variable in the context of a standard normal distribution. After standarization, the BMI=30 discussed on the previous page is shown below lying 0.16667 units above the mean of 0 on the standard normal distribution on the right.     ====  Since the area under the standard curve = 1, we can begin to more precisely define the probabilities of specific observation. For any given Z-score we can compute the area under the curve to the left of that Z-score. The table in the frame below shows the probabilities for the standard normal distribution. Examine the table and note that a "Z" score of 0.0 lists a probability of 0.50 or 50%, and a "Z" score of 1, meaning one standard deviation above the mean, lists a probability of 0.8413 or 84%. That is because one standard deviation above and below the mean encompasses about 68% of the area, so one standard deviation above the mean represents half of that of 34%. So, the 50% below the mean plus the 34% above the mean gives us 84%.  Probabilities of the Standard Normal Distribution Z         This table is organized to provide the area under the curve to the left of or less of a specified value or "Z value". In this case, because the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1, the Z value is the number of standard deviation units away from the mean, and the area is the probability of observing a value less than that particular Z value. Note also that the table shows probabilities to two decimal places of Z. The units place and the first decimal place are shown in the left hand column, and the second decimal place is displayed across the top row.  But let's get back to the question about the probability that the BMI is less than 30, i.e., P(X<30). We can answer this question using the standard normal distribution. The figures below show the distributions of BMI for men aged 60 and the standard normal distribution side-by-side.  Distribution of BMI and Standard Normal Distribution   ====  The area under each curve is one but the scaling of the X axis is different. Note, however, that the areas to the left of the dashed line are the same. The BMI distribution ranges from 11 to 47, while the standardized normal distribution, Z, ranges from -3 to 3. We want to compute P(X < 30). To do this we can determine the Z value that corresponds to X = 30 and then use the standard normal distribution table above to find the probability or area under the curve. The following formula converts an X value into a Z score , also called a standardized score :   where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the variable X.  In order to compute P(X < 30) we convert the X=30 to its corresponding Z score (this is called standardizing ):   Thus, P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17). We can then look up the corresponding probability for this Z score from the standard normal distribution table, which shows that P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17) = 0.5675. Thus, the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI less than 30 is 56.75%.  Another Example  Using the same distribution for BMI, what is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI exceeding 35? In other words, what is P(X > 35)? Again we standardize:   We now go to the standard normal distribution table to look up P(Z>1) and for Z=1.00 we find that P(Z<1.00) = 0.8413. Note, however, that the table always gives the probability that Z is less than the specified value, i.e., it gives us P(Z<1)=0.8413.   Therefore, P(Z>1)=1-0.8413=0.1587. Interpretation: Almost 16% of men aged 60 have BMI over 35.  Normal Probability Calculator         Z-Scores with R  As an alternative to looking up normal probabilities in the table or using Excel, we can use R to compute probabilities. For example,  > pnorm(0)  [1] 0.5  A Z-score of 0 (the mean of any distribution) has 50% of the area to the left. What is the probability that a 60 year old man in the population above has a BMI less than 29 (the mean)? The Z-score would be 0, and pnorm(0)=0.5 or 50%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI less than 30? The Z-score was 0.16667.  > pnorm(0.16667)  [1] 0.5661851  So, the probabilty is 56.6%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI greater than 35?  35-29=6, which is one standard deviation above the mean. So we can compute the area to the left  > pnorm(1)  [1] 0.8413447  and then subtract the result from 1.0.  1-0.8413447= 0.1586553  So the probability of a 60 year ld man having a BMI greater than 35 is 15.8%.  Or, we can use R to compute the entire thing in a single step as follows:  > 1-pnorm(1)  [1] 0.1586553    Probability for a Range of Values   What is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI between 30 and 35? Note that this is the same as asking what proportion of men aged 60 have BMI between 30 and 35. Specifically, we want P(30 < X < 35)? We previously computed P(30<X) and P(X<35); how can these two results be used to compute the probability that BMI will be between 30 and 35? Try to formulate and answer on your own before looking at the explanation below.  Answer     Now consider BMI in women. What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI less than 30? We use the same approach, but for women aged 60 the mean is 28 and the standard deviation is 7.  Answer     What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI exceeding 40? Specifically, what is P(X > 40)?  Answer     return to top | previous page | next page     Content ©2016. All Rights Reserved. Date last modified: July 24, 2016. Wayne W.

%%EOF                  Binomial Probabilities     Probabilities 
          are numbers between 0 and 1, inclusive, that indicate the likelihood 
          of some event or outcome occurring. If an experiment is performed, 
          the resulting basic outcomes comprise a sample 
          space for the experiment.  The sum of the probabilities 
          associated with each of the basic elements in the sample space is always 
          equal to 1.  For example, if an experiment involves tossing a fair 
          coin twice and observing how they fall, a sample space for the experiment 
          is S = {HT, HH, TH, TT}.  If the coin is fair, each of the four 
          outcomes have a probability of 1/4 of occurring and the sum of the four 
          probabilities is 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1.  We summarize this 
          discussion below.     Basic Properties of Probability           Probability 
                  is a number between 0 and 1.      The 
          sum of the basic probabilities associated with the sample space of an 
          experiment is 1.        The study 
                of experiments typically involves calculating probabilities associated 
                with some sample space of the experiment.            Exploration I  The purpose of this exploration 
          is to introduce binomial experiments.  Consider 
          the experiment of tossing a fair coin three times and observing the 
          number of heads that result. This experiment possesses the following 
          characteristics:    It consists of three identical trials of tossing one coin.     Each trial results in exactly one of two outcomes, heads or 
              tails.     The trials are independent, that is, the outcome of one trial 
              does not affect the outcome of any other.     The probability of getting a head remains constant from trial 
              to trial, the probability being   0.5.     1. 
          There are eight different equally likely possibilities that can result 
          from tossing a coin three times. List      them.
        Hint: 
          HHT is one of the possibilities.  2. 
          If the coin is fair, each of the eight outcomes is equally likely to 
          occur. What is the the probability     assigned 
          to each outcome? Remember that probability  is the likelihood that an outcome occurs.  3. 
          Suppose we are interested in the number of heads, X, that occur in three 
          tosses of the coin. How many     values can X take 
          on. Since there are a finite number of values, the variable X is called 
          a discrete random     variable .  4. 
          For each value of X, compute the probability of X, denoted by P(X).     X  P(X)                               5. 
          Show that the sum of the probabilities is 1.  6. 
          Construct a vertical line-segment graph with the probabilities assigned 
          to the vertical axis and the values     of  X
        assigned 
          to the horizontal axis. The line-segment graph is symmetric about what 
          value?       Exploration II   The 
          experiment described in Exploration 1 is an example of a class of experiments, 
          called binomial experiments . In general, a binomial experiment 
          is an experiment which possesses the following four properties:  Characteristics of a Binomial 
          Experiment    The experiment consists of 
              n identical trials.     Each trial results in exactly 
              one of two outcomes, called success or failure. A success is denoted 
              by S and a failure is denoted by F.     The n trials are independent.     The probability of success, 
              p, remains constant from trial to trial.     The 
          probability distribution for the number of successes is called a binomial 
          distribution .  1. 
          Which of the following situations can be modeled using a binomial experiment? 
          Explain.   a. 
          Administering a cold medication with a success rate of 0.90 to ten people 
          with colds and observing the       number 
          of cures [binomial]  b. 
          Tossing a thumbtack eight times and observing the number of times it 
          lands point up   c. 
          Guessing on a ten-question true-false test and observing the number 
          of correct answers   d. 
          Tossing a die six times and observing the numbers of 3's that result [binomial]   e 
          Observing a baseball player with a 0.400 batting average and counting 
          the number of base hits he gets [not
        binomial]   f. 
          Forty percent of all campers at a certain summer camp contract poison 
          ivy. Eight students attend and we      are 
          interested in the number who contract poison ivy.   g. 
          A survey of the residents in a certain town, indicated that 30% of the 
          residents favor building a community       center 
          and 70% are opposed. Ten residents are randomly surveyed and asked if 
          they favor the proposed       new community 
          center. [binomial]   h. 
          A six-sided die is tossed five times and the sum of the faces showing 
          is to be determined.   i. 
          Out of the next ten babies born at Memorial Hospital, the number of 
          males is to be determined.       (Assume 
          that male and female births are equally likely.) [binomial]   j. 
          At a certain college, 40% of entering freshmen eventually graduate. 
          Of 30 freshmen who enroll next      semester, 
          the number who eventually graduate is to be determined.   k. 
          Four candidates are running for governor. A survey is conducted to determine 
          voters' support for the four       candidates. [not binomial]          Exploration III  This 
          exploration introduces the notation used for binomial experiments. The 
          following symbols are used to describe binomial experiments:    S = success     F = failure     p = P(S)     1 - p = P(F)     n = number of trials     X = number of successes        The 
          values n and p are called parameters , which 
          completely determine a binomial probability distribution.    1. 
          A cross fertilization of related species of white-flowered and blue-flowered 
          plants produces offspring of     which 20% are white-flowered 
          plants. Six blue- flowered plants were paired and crossed with six white 
              flowered plants, and it was found that there 
          were two white-flowered plants among the six offspring. Is this
            a binomial 
          experiment? If so, identify a trial, a success, and the values for p 
          , n, and X and P(F).  2. 
          Mary tossed a six-sided die ten times to determine the number of 1s 
          resulting. She obtained three 1s. Is     this a 
          binomial experiment? If so, what constitutes a trial, a success, and 
          a failure? What are the values of     n, p, and 
          X? [A trial is tossing a die and observing the 
          outcome , S  is observing a 1, and F is observing a     number 
          different from 1.  n = 10, p = 1/6, X = 3, and P(F) = 5/6]   Success  is the term used to 
          describe the outcome of interest for a binomial experiment . It does not necessarily correspond 
          to a "good" event.  3. 
          Suppose a certain type of medication will not cause a skin reaction 
          in 90% of the people who use it. We     are interested 
          in the number of people out of the next five who use it and have a skin 
          reaction. Identify a     trial,  a success, the values 
          for p and n, and the possible values of X.      Probabilities 
          associated with a binomial experiment having a large sample space are 
          typically calculated using the binomial probability formula.   Binomial 
            Probability Formula    P(x) 
          = C(n, x) p x (1 - p) n - x    where C(n, x) is the binomial coefficient defined by  Binomial 
              Coefficient  C(n, x) = n! / [x!( n - x)!]   The symbol n! is called n 
              factorial and is defined by  n factorial  n! 
              = n (n - 1)(n - 2) ... (1)   For example, 4! = (4)(3)(2)(1) = 24.  By 
              definition 0! = 1.          Exploration IV  The purpose of this exploration is to use the binomial probability formula 
          to calculate probabilities.  For problems 1 - 4, return to the 
          binomial experiment in Exploration 1 above.  1.  Calculate the binomial coefficient C(3, 0), C(3, 1), C(3, 2) 
          and C(3, 3) by using the binomial coefficient      formula.  2.  Calculate the binomial probabilities P(0), P(1), P(2), and 
          P(3) by using the binomial probability formula.  3.  Check the probabilities in (2) by comparing them to those obtained 
          in Exploration I.  4.  Explain why C(n, x) is called a binomial coefficient.  5.  If an experiment consists of tossing a fair coin four times 
          and observing the results, how many elements      does 
          the sample space of equally likely outcomes have? List them.  6. 
          If the variable X denotes the number of heads obtained in (5), determine 
          the probabilities without using the     binomial 
          probability formula.    X  P(X)    0      1      2      3      4        7.  Use the binomial probability formula to calculate the 5 probabilities 
          in (6). Check your results by      comparing 
          your probabilities with those obtained in (6).      Exploration V   The 
          purpose of this exploration is to become proficient using the online 
          binomial calculator . In 
          the problems that follow, X is assumed to be a binomial random variable.  1. 
          For n = 6 and p = 0.5, find the values of P(X = r) for r = 0, 1, 2, 
          3, 4, 5, and 6.  2. 
          Determine the sum of the seven probabilities. [1]   3. 
          Find the sum of the probabilities associated with the following binomial 
          parameters.  a. n = 5 and p = 0.4   b. n = 4 and p = 0.6   c. n = 5 and p = 0.3  4. Form a generalization 
          concerning the sum of the binomial probabilities associated with parameters 
          n and     p. [The sum of the 
          probabilities always equals 1]   5. 
          Let n = 20 and p = 0.55. Determine each of the following probabilities 
          using the binomial calculators in two     different 
          ways.  a. 
          P( X greater than or equal to 18 ). [one 
          way is P(18) + P(19) + P(20); another is 1 - P(X < 18)  The
              answer is 0.0009.]  Note that 
          the notation 8.0E-4 is scientific notation meaning 0.0008.   b. P( 9 < X < 13 ).  c. P( X > 12 ).  d. P( X less than or equal to 3 ).  e. P( X < 8 or X > 14 ). [One 
          way is 1 - P(8) - P(9) - P(10) - P(11) - P(12) - P(13) - P(14).  Why? 
                          Another

MORE Sign In Join    16    Owlcation » STEM » Math     How to Calculate Lottery Probability Updated on December 13, 2016   dezalyx   more Contact Author   Source       About the Author Dez has been a mathematician since grade school and has a master's degree in Applied Mathematics.   As a mathematician, I have never purchased a lottery ticket. I find the odds depressing and have never had luck in winning anything from these kinds of games.  This hub is all about calculating lottery probability or odds. In order to make it more relevant to me, I decided to base it on the Grandlotto 6/55, the lottery game with the biggest prize money here in the Philippines. There will be two different cases discussed in the hub: the probability of winning the game with all six numbers matching, and the probability of having n numbers matching.   Rules of the Lottery Game It is always important to find out the rules of any game before participating in it. For the Grandlotto 6/55, in order to win the jackpot prize, you have to match six numbers from a pool of 55 numbers ranging from 1-55. The initial payout is a minimum of P20 (or around $0.47). It is also possible to win some money if you are able to match three, four, or five numbers of the winning combination. Note that the order of the winning combination here does not matter.  Here is a table for the prizes you can obtain:     No. of Matching Nos.   Prize Money (in Php)   Prize Money (in $)   6   minimum of 30 million   ~700,000   5   150,000   ~3,500   4   2,000   ~47   3   150   ~4      Some Probability Concepts Before we start with the calculations, I would like to talk about Permutations and Combinations . This is one of the basic concepts you learn in Probability Theory. The main difference being that permutations consider order to be important, while in combinations, order isn't important.  In a lottery ticket, permutation should be used if the numbers in your ticket have to match the order of the draw for the winning string of numbers. In the Grandlotto 6/55, order is not important because so long as you have the winning set of numbers, you can win the prize.  The next formulas only apply for numbers without repetition . This means that if the number x is drawn, it cannot be drawn again. If the number drawn from the set is returned before the next draw, then that has repetition.   This is the formula for Permutations, where order is important. | Source       This is the formula for Combinations, where order is not important. | Source   , where n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.  Note that based on the formulas given, C(n,k) is always less than or equal to P(n,k). You will see later on why it is important to make this distinction for calculating lottery odds or probability.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability for 6 Matching Numbers So now that we know the basic concepts of permutations and combinations, let us go back to the example of Grandlotto 6/55. For the game, n = 55, the total number of possible choices. k = 6, the number of choices we can make. Because order is not important, we will use the formula for combination:   Source   These are the odds or the total number of possible combinations for any 6-digit number to win the game. To find the probability, just divide 1 by the number above, and you will get: 0.0000000344 or 0.00000344%. See what I mean by depressing odds?  So what if we're talking about a different lottery game where order does matter. We will now use the permutation formula to get the following:   Source   Compare these two results and you will see that the odds for getting the winning combination where order matters has 3 additional zero's! It's going from about 28 million:1 odds to 20 billion:1 odds! The probability of winning for this case is 1 divided by the odds which equals to 0.0000000000479 or 0.00000000479%.  As you can see, because the permutation is always greater than or equal to the combination, the probability of winning a game where order matters is always less than or equal to the probability of winning a game where order does not matter. Because the risk is greater for games where order is required, this implies that the reward must also be higher.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability with Less Than 6 Matching Numbers Because you can also win prizes if you have less than 6 matching numbers, this section will show you how to calculate the probability if there are x matches to the winning set of numbers.  First, we need to find the number of way to choose x winning numbers from the set and multiply it by the number of ways to choose the losing numbers for the remaining 6-x numbers. Consider the number of ways to choose x winning numbers. Because there are only 6 possible winning numbers, in essence, we are only choosing x from a pool of 6. And so, because order does not matter, we get C(6, x).  Next, we consider the number of ways to choose the remaining 6-x balls from the pool of losing numbers. Because 6 are winning numbers, we have 55 - 6 = 49 balls to choose the losing numbers from. So, the number of possibilities for choosing a losing ball can be obtained from C(49, 6 - x). Again, order does not matter here.  So, in order to calculate the probability of winning with x matching numbers out of a possible 6, we need to divide the outcome from the previous two paragraphs by the total number of possibilities to win with all 6 matching numbers. We get:       Source   If we write this in a more general form, we get:   Source   , where n = total number of balls in the set, k = total number of balls in the winning combination for the jackpot prize, and x = total numbers of balls matching the winning set of numbers.  If we use this formula to calculate the probability (and the odds) of winning the Grandlotto 6/55 with only x matching numbers, we get the following:     x matches   Calculation   Probability   Odds (1/Probability)   0   C(6,0) * C(49,6)/C(55,6)   0.48237   2.07308   1   C(6,1) * C(49,5)/C(55,6)   0.39466   2.53777   2   C(6,2) * C(49,4)/C(55,6)   0.10963   9.12158   3   C(6,3) * C(49,3)/C(55,6)   0.01271   78.67367   4   C(6,4) * C(49,2)/C(55,6)   0.00060   1643.40561   5   C(6,5) * C(49,1)/C(55,6)   0.00001   98604.33673   6   C(6,6) * C(49,0)/C(55,6)   0.00000003   28989675      How to Choose the Winning Numbers in Lottery As you can see from the math in this hub, the probability of winning the lottery is the same for any 6-number combination available in the Grandlotto 6/55 game. This is also applicable for other lottery games out there.  As I was researching for this hub, I came across links that said never choose numbers that are sequential, like from 1-6 or some such nonsense. There is no such secret to winning the lottery! Each number is as equally likely to come up in the draw as the next number.  If you are willing to face the very little probability of winning the lottery, I say go choose any number you want. You can base it on your birthdays, special days, anniversaries, lucky numbers, etc. Just remember that with great risk comes great reward!

However there are also many factors(known and many unknown) which produces lottery results that happen to produce patterns, which may help in striking like few matching numbers but still ultra difficult in winning 6 matching numbers. It's still a combination of luck, for now i conclude it's combination of probability+luck (L.O.A or whatever u wanna call it)...cheers n good luck hehe  Author dezalyx 2 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Subs. From the definition of classical probability, every statistical outcome will contain elements that are equally likely to happen. This means that if you roll a 6-sided dice, it is equally probable that the outcome will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Or in the case of flipping a coin, the probability of heads will be equal to the probability of tails. No magic coins, no loaded dice, all equally probable to happen. When calculating the lottery probability in this article, this assumption is already used. This is usually the case when calculating probabilities theoretically. Having no affiliation to companies who hold the lottery, it would be difficult for me to assume that certain balls are more likely to surface because they are loaded. In my opinion, historical data does not have any bearing on lottery outcomes. Statistically speaking, working on other probability approaches will not work because of this. Just because the number N appears frequently in lottery drawings, does not mean that the ball is more likely to surface than the number N+1 in the next drawing.  Subs 2 months ago  Can the classical probability theory be used here? And please give an example  Subs 2 months ago  What other probability approaches can be used?  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Odds. Thanks for commenting. I did not say choosing one's birthday would contribute to one's luck. I just said you can choose any number you want if you're willing to face the fact that there's only a very small chance that you can win the jackpot prize. Heck, you could choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 if you wanted to. The basis of this article is that the probability of each ball getting drawn is the same as any other ball in the lottery. While I kept getting comments on how likely certain numbers will get picked over other numbers, mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as having weighted balls for lottery drawings. While you might not have studied mathematics, you certainly were on point when you said that you should never try your luck in gambling. That's actually a mathematician's saying. Never gamble, because the house always wins.  ODDS 7 months ago  I didn't study mathematics, but you were wrong when you mentioned that the numbers of the player's birthday would contribute to his luck, rather it would add up to the improbability, because certainly the player would not live enough to wait his birthday's numbers to come up! And yeah you certainly can top up your chances even if mathematically every number may pop up randomly. If i were to buy a ticket, i would consider not selecting numbers that are altogether evens/odds, divisible by 5 altogether etc. If the order does not matter, you will get more chances! But you know what, never try your luck in gambling, it's made to steal your money and you end up depressed.  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, jazer. I've been receiving a ton of comments lately asking for what the winning number will be for the next lottery draw, but the article is just about the probability of winning the lottery. I don't know about the specifics of the composition of lotto balls, since it probably differs for every company that makes them, but looking for trends when there is no factual basis will just result in you losing money. And given the odds of winning the lottery, you would be better off investing that money in something else with a higher chance of getting a profit. While I agree with the idea that maybe the composition of the balls would get it drawn more than the others, you can never bank on that, since it could be changed without you ever knowing about it (repainting the balls numbers, changing the balls entirely, having different sets of balls for different drawings, etc.).      jazer 8 months ago  Probability is probability. We cannot predict the future. But for the purpose of conversation, some people used they called a "trend". A history of past result. From trend you may "guess" which number can be with higher probability. Is this true in nature? Actually, this is only my opinion. My reasoning with the trend is somewhat related to the composition of the lotto balls e.g. weight, etc, that's why some numbers were drawn more that the others. What is your opinion on this? Thanks.  Kgomotso Comfort 9 months ago  I just want know how can I calculate the probabilities of 6/49  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Edgard, it seems to me that your question is still about the gambler's fallacy. Just because a certain number comes out approximately 6 times out of x number of drawings will not change the probability of the number being drawn again in the future. Imagine changing the game into a simple heads or tails coin flip. The probability of getting either outcome is 1/2. Just because you get 6 heads in a row does not mean the next result would be a tail. Even if you get 100 heads in a row, the probability of getting either outcome is still going to be 1/2. There won't be any probability equations to predict what you are looking for. If there is, the people who have discovered such equations would already be taking advantage of the lottery system. The only thing you can do with the study is plot historical graphs on how many times a certain number has come out previously and marvel at how some numbers seem to appear more than others.  Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalix, We really appreciate your time and answers We are aware that there will always be an average for any set of numbers, also we can find a trend to explain any series of numbers, but these work outs are not a guaranty that we will get really meaningful results. Our previous questions came out from the following fact: We made a sequential review of winning numbers of 260 draws of a 6/45 lottery, to find out the number of times (frequency) that each of the 45 balls was drawn; we started with a 160 draws sample, and increased the sample with 10 draws data each time, until we got the last sample of 260 draws; with every sample of draws, we worked out the rate = [total draws of the sample / frequency of each ball in the sample] for every ball, then we worked out the average of this 45 ratios; the result clearly showed a steady trend for this average, which started at 6.63, for the 160 draws sample, to 6.55 for the 260 draws sample; of course we could work with more sample, but we just decided to stop at 260 draws sample. We initially thought this ratio means the average number of draws we expect to wait for a ball to be drawn; but, what would be the right mining of this average (6.55), if any?, why the average has a steady trend?, and is there any probability equation to predict this average? ratio ni = [N° draws/Freq ni] i = [1, 45] Samples	       Average N° Draws	of ratios      Min ratio  Max ratio 260	                6.55	      4.73            8.97 250	                6.56	      4.63	          8.93 240	                6.57	      4.44	          8.57 230	                6.59	      4.26	          8.85 220	                6.58	      4.31	          8.46 210	                6.59	      4.29	          9.13 200	                6.61	      4.17	          9.09 190	                6.61	      4.13	          8.64 180	                6.62	      3.91	          9.00 170	                6.62	      3.95	          8.95 160	                6.63	      3.81	          8.89 Regards Edgard  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines No. The law of large numbers indicate that given a large number of opportunities, we should expect a certain event to happen again, no matter how unlikely it may be. For example, a set of 6 lottery numbers can get picked 2 weeks in a row. But, just because it happened, doesn't mean you should go running to buy the same exact set of numbers in the hopes of getting lucky. Each lottery picking is still independent of each other. So the probability of picking the correct set of numbers will remain the same for each drawing. Saying that one number has the chance to be drawn every specific number of games is succumbing to gambler's fallacy (mistaken belief that just because something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future). Odds represent the ratio that allow you to calculate how much money you will win on your bet in comparison to your stake. So your $10 ticket can become $23.67 if one number gets drawn. That is why you will notice that the odds keep increasing as you get more matches, meaning you get more money the more matches you get. I hope this answers your question, Edgard.      Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalyx, Thanks again, Regarding the same game 6/45: As the probability of one match is  0.42417, then Odds (1/Probability) will be 2.3678. According to probability theory and the law of large numbers, is it right to say, at least theoretically, that every 2.3678 games we should expect one match; in other words, one number has the chance to be drawn every 2.3678 games?  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Edgar. Just replace the numbers in the formula (from 55 to 45, 49 to 39) then solve for the answer to your question. [0.4241]  Edgard 11 months ago  ¿What would be the probability of one single ball to be part of the winner combination in a game where we have to pick a 6 number combination out of 45 numbers?.

Randomly sample n = 15 Americans. Let X denote the number in the sample with no health insurance. What is the probability that exactly 3 of the 15 sampled have no health insurance?   Solution. Since n = 15 is small relative to the population of N = 300,000,000 Americans, and all of the other criteria pass muster (two possible outcomes, independent trials, ....), the random variable X can be assumed to follow a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.20. Using the probability mass function for a binomial random variable, the calculation is then relatively straightforward:  \(P(X=3)=\dbinom{15}{3}(0.20)^3 (0.80)^{12}=0.25\)  That is, there is a 25% chance, in sampling 15 random Americans, that we would find exactly 3 that had no health insurance.   What is the probability that at most one of those sampled has no health insurance?   Solution. "At most one" means either 0 or 1 of those sampled have no health insurance. That is, we need to find:  P ( X ≤ 1) = P ( X = 0) + P ( X = 1)   Using the probability mass function for a binomial random variable with n = 15 and p = 0.20, we have:  \(P(X \leq 1)=\dbinom{15}{0}(0.2)^0 (0.8)^{15}+ \dbinom{15}{1}(0.2)^1(0.8)^{14}=0.0352+0.1319=0.167\)  That is, we have a 16.7% chance, in sampling 15 random Americans, that we would find at most one that had no health insurance.   What is the probability that more than seven have no health insurance?   Solution. Yikes! "More than seven" in the sample means 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. As the following picture illustrates, there are two ways that we can calculate P ( X > 7):   We could calculate P ( X > 7) by adding up P ( X = 8),  P ( X = 9), up to P ( X = 15). Alternatively, we could calculate P ( X > 7) by finding P ( X ≤ 7) and subtracting it from 1. But to find P ( X ≤ 7), we'd still have to add up P ( X = 0),  P ( X = 1), up to P ( X = 7). Either way, it becomes readily apparent that answering this question is going to involve more work than the previous two questions. It would clearly be helpful if we had an alternative to using the binomial p.m.f. to calculate binomial probabilities. The alternative typically used involves cumulative binomial probabilities.   An Aside On Cumulative Probability Distributions      Definition. The function:  F ( x ) = P ( X ≤ x )  is called a cumulative probability distribution . For a discrete random variable X , the cumulative probability distribution F ( x ) is determined by:  \(F(x)=\sum\limits_{m=0}^x f(m)=f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(x)\)      You'll first want to note that the probability mass function, f ( x ), of a discrete random variable X is distinguished from the cumulative probability distribution, F ( x ), of a discrete random variable X by the use of a lowercase f and an uppercase F . That is, the notation f (3) means P ( X = 3), while the notation F (3) means P ( X ≤ 3) .  Now the standard procedure is to report probabilities for a particular distribution as cumulative probabilities, whether in statistical software such as Minitab, a TI-80-something calculator, or in a table like Table II in the back of your textbook. If you take a look at the table, you'll see that it goes on for five pages.  Let's just take a look at the top of the first page of the table in order to get a feel for how the table works:     In summary, to use the table in the back of your textbook, as well as that found in the back of most probability textbooks, to find cumulative binomial probabilities, do the following:   Find n , the number in the sample, in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p , the probability of success .  Find the x in the second column on the left for which you want to find F ( x ) = P ( X ≤ x ).   Let's try it out on our health insurance example.  Example  Again, by some estimates, twenty-percent (20%) of Americans have no health insurance. Randomly sample n = 15 Americans. Let X denote the number in the sample with no health insurance. Use the cumulative binomial probability table in the back of your book to find the probability that at most 1 of the 15 sampled has no health insurance.   Solution. The probability that at most 1 has no health insurance can be written as P ( X ≤ 1). To find P ( X ≤ 1) using the binomial table, we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 1 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (1) = P ( X ≤ 1).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 1) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  We've used the cumulative binomial probability table to determine that the probability that at most 1 of the 15 sampled has no health insurance is 0.1671. For kicks, since it wouldn't take a lot of work in this case, you might want to verify that you'd get the same answer using the binomial p.m.f.   What is the probability that more than 7 have no health insurance?   Solution. As we determined previously, we can calculate P ( X > 7) by finding P ( X ≤ 7) and subtracting it from 1:   The good news is that the cumulative binomial probability table makes it easy to determine P ( X ≤ 7). To find P ( X ≤ 7) using the binomial table, we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 7 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (7) = P ( X ≤ 7).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 7) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that P ( X ≤ 7) = 0.9958. Therefore:  P ( X > 7) = 1 − 0.9958 = 0.0042  That is, the probability that more than 7 in a random sample of 15 would have no health insurance is 0.0042.   What is the probability that exactly 3 have no health insurance?   Solution. We can calculate P ( X = 3) by finding P ( X ≤ 2) and subtracting it from P ( X ≤ 3) , as illustrated here:    To find P ( X ≤ 2) and P ( X ≤ 3) using the binomial table, we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 3 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (3) = P ( X ≤ 3). And, find th e 2 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (2) = P ( X ≤ 2).   Now, all we need to do is (1) read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 3) row intersect, and (2) read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 2) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?   The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that finding P ( X ≤ 3) = 0.6482 and P ( X ≤ 2) = 0.3980. Therefore:  P ( X = 3) = P ( X ≤ 3) − P ( X ≤ 2) = 0.6482 − 0.3980 = 0.2502  That is, there is about a 25% chance that exactly 3 people in a random sample of 15 would have no health insurance. Again, for kicks, since it wouldn't take a lot of work in this case, you might want to verify that you'd get the same answer using the binomial p.m.f.   What is the probability that at least 1 has no health insurance?   Solution. We can calculate P ( X ≥ 1) by finding P ( X ≤ 0) and subtracting it from 1, as illustrated here:    To find P ( X ≤ 0) using the binomial table, we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 0 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (0) = P ( X ≤ 0).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 0) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that P ( X ≤ 0) = 0.0352. Therefore:  P ( X ≥ 1) = 1 − 0.0352 = 0.9648  That is, the probability that at least one person in a random sample of 15 would have no health insurance is 0.9648.   What is the probability that fewer than 5 have no health insurance?   Solution. "Fewer than 5" means 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. That is, P ( X < 5) = P ( X ≤ 4) , and P ( X ≤ 4) can be readily found using the cumulative binomial table. To find P ( X ≤ 4) , we:   Find n = 15 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.20 .  Find the 4 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (4) = P ( X ≤ 4).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.20 column and the ( n = 15, x = 4) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that P ( X ≤ 4) = 0.8358. That is, the probability that fewer than 5 people in a random sample of 15 would have no health insurance is 0.8358.   We have now taken a look at an example involving all of the possible scenarios... at most x , more than x , exactly x , at least x , and f ewer than x ... of the kinds of binomial probabilities that you might need to find. Oops! Have you noticed that p , the probability of success, in the binomial table in the back of the book only goes up to 0.50. What happens if your p equals 0.60 or 0.70? All you need to do in that case is turn the problem on its head! For example, suppose you have n = 10 and p = 0.60, and you are looking for the probability of at most 3 successes. Just change the definition of a success into a failure, and vice versa! That is, finding the probability of at most 3 successes is equivalent to 7 or more failures with the probability of a failure being 0.40. Shall we make this more concrete by looking at a specific example?  Example  Many utility companies promote energy conservation by offering discount rates to consumers who keep their energy usage below certain established subsidy standards. A recent EPA report notes that 70% of the island residents of Puerto Rico have reduced their electricity usage sufficiently to qualify for discounted rates. If ten residential subscribers are randomly selected from San Juan, Puerto Rico, what is the probability that at least four qualify for the favorable rates?   Solution. If we let X denote the number of subscribers who qualify for favorable rates, then X is a binomial random variable with n = 10 and p = 0.70. And, if we let Y denote the number of subscribers who don't qualify for favorable rates, then Y , which equals 10 − X , is a binomial random variable with n = 10 and q = 1 − p = 0.30. We are interested in finding P ( X ≥ 4). We can't use the cumulative binomial tables, because they only go up to p = 0.50. The good news is that we can rewrite P ( X ≥ 4) as a probability statement in terms of Y :  P ( X ≥ 4) = P (− X ≤ −4) = P (10 − X ≤ 10 − 4) = P ( Y ≤ 6)  Now it's just a matter of looking up the probability in the right place on our cumulative binomial table. To find P ( Y ≤ 6) , we:   Find n = 10 in the first column on the left.  Find the column containing p = 0.30 .  Find the 6 in the second column on the left, since we want to find F (6) = P ( Y ≤ 6).   Now, all we need to do is read the probability value where the p = 0.30 column and the ( n = 10, y = 6) row intersect. What do you get?   Do you need a hint?  The cumulative binomial probability table tells us that P ( Y ≤ 6) = P ( X ≥ 4) = 0.9894. That is, the probability that at least four people in a random sample of ten would qualify for favorable rates is 0.9894.   If you are in need of calculating binomial probabilities for more specific probabilities of success ( p ), such as 0.37 or 0.61, you can use statistical software, such as Minitab, to determine the cumulative binomial probabilities. You can then still use the methods illustrated here on this page to find the specific probabilities (more than x , fewer than x , ...) that you need.    ‹ Is X Binomial?  up  Effect of n and p on Shape ›      Printer-friendly version               Navigation    Start Here!

Cumulative
        probabilities provide, for each value x , the
        probability of a result less than or equal to X ,
        P[ X <= x ]. ( <= is "less than
        or equal to." Don't blame me. . .call Netscape &
        Microsoft.)   Example 1  Here's the probability distribution for a
        discrete random variable X     x   f(x)     1  0.1    2  0.2    3  0.4    4  0.3    The cumulative
        distribution function tables, for each value x = 1, 2, 3,
        4, the probability of a result less than or equal to x.
        (In efficient English "less than or equal to"
        is often written "at most" or "no more
        than." These three phrases have the same meaning.)
        For example   P[ X <= 1 ] = 0.1  P[ X <= 2 ] = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3  P[ X <= 3 ] = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.7  P[ X <= 4 ] = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1   These probabilities can be tabled    x  P[ X <= x ]    1  0.1    2  0.3    3  0.7    4  1.0     Example 2  Suppose that P[ X <= 3 ] = 0.65, P[ X  <= 4 ] = 0.80 and no values between 3 and 4 are
        possible. Then P[ X = 4 ] = 0.80 - 0.65 = 0.15.
        So, to compute f(x) , take   f(x) = P[ X <= x ] - P[ X
            <= x * ]   where x * is the largest possible value below x .
        If x is already the smallest value then   f(x) = P[ X  <=x ].   Suppose the number of finish flaws on an automobile
        has the following cumulative probabilities.    x  P[ X <= x ]    0  0.30119    1  0.66263    2  0.87949    3  0.96623    4  0.99225    5  0.99850    6  0.99975    7  0.99996    8  1.00000    Questions  Answers in red!   Find the probability there are at most 2 flaws,
                P[ X  <= 2 ]. 0.87949  Find the probability there are exactly 2 flaws,
                P[ X = 2 ]. 0.87949 - 0.66263 = 0.21686  Find the probability there are less than 2 flaws,
                P[ X < 2 ].  0.66263  Find the probability there are more than 2 flaws,
                P[ X > 2 ]. 1 - 0.87949 = 0.12051  Find the probability there are at least 2 flaws,
                P[ X >= 2 ]. 1 - 0.66263 = 0.33737  Find the probability there are no flaws. P[ X = 0 ] = P[ X <= 0] = 0.30119  Find the probability there is at least one flaw. 1 - 0.30119 = 0.69881  Find the probability there are between 1 and 3
                flaws, inclusive, P[ 1 <= X  <= 3 ]. 0.96623 - 0.30119 = 0.66504   It is far better to understand what
        information is in the table-what the table
        "means"-and to think about the question, than
        it is to try to memorize 5 different strategies for
        handling these cases.There is an "easy" (if
        tedious) method for recovering f(x) -from each
        cumulative probability subtract its predecessor. For this
        example:    x   P[ X  <= x ]    f(x)    0  0.30119  0.30119 - 0.00000 =  0.30119    1  0.66263  0.66263 - 0.30119 =  0.36144    2  0.87949  0.87949 - 0.66263 =  0.21686    3  0.96623  0.96623 - 0.87949 =  0.08674    4  0.99225  0.99225 -
                0.96623 =   0.02602    5  0.99850  0.99850 - 0.99225 =  0.00625    6  0.99975  0.99975 - 0.99850 =  0.00125    7  0.99996  0.99996 - 0.99975 =  0.00021    8  1.00000  1.00000 - 0.99996 =  0.00004          1.00000    You can use this table to find answers
        to the questions above. Whichever way you do it, your
        results should be the same.   Do you understand it? If so, perhaps you'd like to try
        the worksheet on
        this topic?             Random Variables A random variable X discrete continuous Discrete Random Variables discrete random variable The probability distribution ( Definitions taken from Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 ) Suppose a random variable X may take k different 
values, with the probability that X = x i defined to be P(X = x i ) = p i .  The probabilities p i must satisfy the following: 1: 0 < p i  < 1 for each i 2: p 1 + p 2 + ... + p k = 1.   Example  Suppose a variable X can take the values 1, 2, 3, or 4. The probabilities associated with each outcome are described by the
following table: Outcome 	1	2	3	4
	Probability	0.1	0.3	0.4	0.2 The probability that X is equal to 2 or 3 is the sum of the two
probabilities: P(X = 2 or X = 3) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 
0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7.  Similarly, the probability that X is greater 
than 1 is equal to 1 - P(X = 1) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9, by 
the complement rule . This distribution may also be described by the probability
histogram cumulative 
distribution function X x x ( Definition taken from Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 )  Example  The cumulative distribution function for the above probability 
distribution is calculated as follows: The probability that X is less than or equal to 1 is 0.1, the probability that X is less than or equal to 2 is 0.1+0.3 = 0.4, the probability that X is less than or equal to 3 is 0.1+0.3+0.4 = 0.8, 
and the probability that X is less than or equal to 4 is 0.1+0.3+0.4+0.2 = 1. The probability histogram for the cumulative distribution of this 
random variable is shown to the right:  Continuous Random Variables A continuous random variable is one which takes an 
infinite number of possible values. Continuous random variables are 
usually measurements. Examples include height, weight, the amount of 
sugar in an orange, the time required to run a mile. ( Definition taken from Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 ) A continuous random variable is not defined at specific values.  Instead, 
it is defined over an interval of values, and is represented by 
the area under a curve integral Suppose a random variable X may take all values over an interval of
real numbers.  Then the probability that X is in the 
set of outcomes A, P(A) , is defined to be the area above A and
under a curve.  The curve, which represents a function p(x) , must 
satisfy the following: 1: The curve has no negative values (p(x) > 0 for all x) 2: The total area under the curve is equal to 1.  A curve meeting these requirements is known as a density curve .   The Uniform Distribution A random number generator acting over an interval of numbers (a,b) has a continuous distribution.  Since any interval of numbers of equal width
has an equal probability of being observed, the curve describing the
distribution is a rectangle, with constant height across the interval
and 0 height elsewhere.  Since the area under the curve must be equal to 1,
the length of the interval determines the height of the curve. The following graphs plot the density curves for random number generators
over the intervals (4,5) (top left), (2,6) (top right), (5,5.5) (lower left),
and (3,5) (lower right).  The distributions corresponding to these curves are
known as uniform distributions .   Consider the uniform random variable X defined on the interval (2,6).  Since the interval
has width = 4, the curve has height = 0.25 over the interval and 0 elsewhere.  The probability
that X is less than or equal to 5 is the area between 2 and 5, or (5-2)*0.25 = 0.75.  
The probability that X is greater than 3 but less than 4 is the area between 3 and 4,
(4-3)*0.25 = 0.25.  To find that probability that X is less than 3 or greater than
5, add the two probabilities: P(X < 3 and X > 5) = P(X < 3) + P(X > 5) = (3-2)*0.25 +
(6-5)*0.25 = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5. The uniform distribution is often used to simulate data.  Suppose you would like to simulate data
for 10 rolls of a regular 6-sided die.  Using the MINITAB "RAND" command with the "UNIF" subcommand
generates 10 numbers in the interval (0,6): MTB > RAND 10 c2;
SUBC> unif 0 6. Assign the discrete random variable X to the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as follows: if 0<X<1, X=1 if 1<X<2, X=2 if 2<X<3, X=3 if 3<X<4, X=4 if 4<X<5, X=5 if X>5, X=6. Use the generated MINITAB data to assign X to a value for each roll of the die: Uniform Data		X Value
4.53786			5
5.77474			6
3.69518			4
1.03929			2
4.23835			5
0.37096			1
0.75272			1
5.56563			6
0.89045			1
3.18086			4  Another type of continuous density curve is the normal distribution .
The area under the curve is not easy to calculate for a normal random variable X with
mean and standard deviation .  However, tables (and computer functions) are 
available for the standard random variable Z , which is 
computed from X by subtracting and dividing by .  
All of the rules of probability apply to the normal distribution.

The standard normal distribution is centered at zero and the degree to which a given measurement deviates from the mean is given by the standard deviation. For the standard normal distribution, 68% of the observations lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean; 95% lie within two standard deviation of the mean; and 99.9% lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. To this point, we have been using "X" to denote the variable of interest (e.g., X=BMI, X=height, X=weight). However, when using a standard normal distribution, we will use "Z" to refer to a variable in the context of a standard normal distribution. After standarization, the BMI=30 discussed on the previous page is shown below lying 0.16667 units above the mean of 0 on the standard normal distribution on the right.     ====  Since the area under the standard curve = 1, we can begin to more precisely define the probabilities of specific observation. For any given Z-score we can compute the area under the curve to the left of that Z-score. The table in the frame below shows the probabilities for the standard normal distribution. Examine the table and note that a "Z" score of 0.0 lists a probability of 0.50 or 50%, and a "Z" score of 1, meaning one standard deviation above the mean, lists a probability of 0.8413 or 84%. That is because one standard deviation above and below the mean encompasses about 68% of the area, so one standard deviation above the mean represents half of that of 34%. So, the 50% below the mean plus the 34% above the mean gives us 84%.  Probabilities of the Standard Normal Distribution Z         This table is organized to provide the area under the curve to the left of or less of a specified value or "Z value". In this case, because the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1, the Z value is the number of standard deviation units away from the mean, and the area is the probability of observing a value less than that particular Z value. Note also that the table shows probabilities to two decimal places of Z. The units place and the first decimal place are shown in the left hand column, and the second decimal place is displayed across the top row.  But let's get back to the question about the probability that the BMI is less than 30, i.e., P(X<30). We can answer this question using the standard normal distribution. The figures below show the distributions of BMI for men aged 60 and the standard normal distribution side-by-side.  Distribution of BMI and Standard Normal Distribution   ====  The area under each curve is one but the scaling of the X axis is different. Note, however, that the areas to the left of the dashed line are the same. The BMI distribution ranges from 11 to 47, while the standardized normal distribution, Z, ranges from -3 to 3. We want to compute P(X < 30). To do this we can determine the Z value that corresponds to X = 30 and then use the standard normal distribution table above to find the probability or area under the curve. The following formula converts an X value into a Z score , also called a standardized score :   where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the variable X.  In order to compute P(X < 30) we convert the X=30 to its corresponding Z score (this is called standardizing ):   Thus, P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17). We can then look up the corresponding probability for this Z score from the standard normal distribution table, which shows that P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17) = 0.5675. Thus, the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI less than 30 is 56.75%.  Another Example  Using the same distribution for BMI, what is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI exceeding 35? In other words, what is P(X > 35)? Again we standardize:   We now go to the standard normal distribution table to look up P(Z>1) and for Z=1.00 we find that P(Z<1.00) = 0.8413. Note, however, that the table always gives the probability that Z is less than the specified value, i.e., it gives us P(Z<1)=0.8413.   Therefore, P(Z>1)=1-0.8413=0.1587. Interpretation: Almost 16% of men aged 60 have BMI over 35.  Normal Probability Calculator         Z-Scores with R  As an alternative to looking up normal probabilities in the table or using Excel, we can use R to compute probabilities. For example,  > pnorm(0)  [1] 0.5  A Z-score of 0 (the mean of any distribution) has 50% of the area to the left. What is the probability that a 60 year old man in the population above has a BMI less than 29 (the mean)? The Z-score would be 0, and pnorm(0)=0.5 or 50%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI less than 30? The Z-score was 0.16667.  > pnorm(0.16667)  [1] 0.5661851  So, the probabilty is 56.6%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI greater than 35?  35-29=6, which is one standard deviation above the mean. So we can compute the area to the left  > pnorm(1)  [1] 0.8413447  and then subtract the result from 1.0.  1-0.8413447= 0.1586553  So the probability of a 60 year ld man having a BMI greater than 35 is 15.8%.  Or, we can use R to compute the entire thing in a single step as follows:  > 1-pnorm(1)  [1] 0.1586553    Probability for a Range of Values   What is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI between 30 and 35? Note that this is the same as asking what proportion of men aged 60 have BMI between 30 and 35. Specifically, we want P(30 < X < 35)? We previously computed P(30<X) and P(X<35); how can these two results be used to compute the probability that BMI will be between 30 and 35? Try to formulate and answer on your own before looking at the explanation below.  Answer     Now consider BMI in women. What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI less than 30? We use the same approach, but for women aged 60 the mean is 28 and the standard deviation is 7.  Answer     What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI exceeding 40? Specifically, what is P(X > 40)?  Answer     return to top | previous page | next page     Content ©2016. All Rights Reserved. Date last modified: July 24, 2016. Wayne W.

%%EOF                  Binomial Probabilities     Probabilities 
          are numbers between 0 and 1, inclusive, that indicate the likelihood 
          of some event or outcome occurring. If an experiment is performed, 
          the resulting basic outcomes comprise a sample 
          space for the experiment.  The sum of the probabilities 
          associated with each of the basic elements in the sample space is always 
          equal to 1.  For example, if an experiment involves tossing a fair 
          coin twice and observing how they fall, a sample space for the experiment 
          is S = {HT, HH, TH, TT}.  If the coin is fair, each of the four 
          outcomes have a probability of 1/4 of occurring and the sum of the four 
          probabilities is 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1.  We summarize this 
          discussion below.     Basic Properties of Probability           Probability 
                  is a number between 0 and 1.      The 
          sum of the basic probabilities associated with the sample space of an 
          experiment is 1.        The study 
                of experiments typically involves calculating probabilities associated 
                with some sample space of the experiment.            Exploration I  The purpose of this exploration 
          is to introduce binomial experiments.  Consider 
          the experiment of tossing a fair coin three times and observing the 
          number of heads that result. This experiment possesses the following 
          characteristics:    It consists of three identical trials of tossing one coin.     Each trial results in exactly one of two outcomes, heads or 
              tails.     The trials are independent, that is, the outcome of one trial 
              does not affect the outcome of any other.     The probability of getting a head remains constant from trial 
              to trial, the probability being   0.5.     1. 
          There are eight different equally likely possibilities that can result 
          from tossing a coin three times. List      them.
        Hint: 
          HHT is one of the possibilities.  2. 
          If the coin is fair, each of the eight outcomes is equally likely to 
          occur. What is the the probability     assigned 
          to each outcome? Remember that probability  is the likelihood that an outcome occurs.  3. 
          Suppose we are interested in the number of heads, X, that occur in three 
          tosses of the coin. How many     values can X take 
          on. Since there are a finite number of values, the variable X is called 
          a discrete random     variable .  4. 
          For each value of X, compute the probability of X, denoted by P(X).     X  P(X)                               5. 
          Show that the sum of the probabilities is 1.  6. 
          Construct a vertical line-segment graph with the probabilities assigned 
          to the vertical axis and the values     of  X
        assigned 
          to the horizontal axis. The line-segment graph is symmetric about what 
          value?       Exploration II   The 
          experiment described in Exploration 1 is an example of a class of experiments, 
          called binomial experiments . In general, a binomial experiment 
          is an experiment which possesses the following four properties:  Characteristics of a Binomial 
          Experiment    The experiment consists of 
              n identical trials.     Each trial results in exactly 
              one of two outcomes, called success or failure. A success is denoted 
              by S and a failure is denoted by F.     The n trials are independent.     The probability of success, 
              p, remains constant from trial to trial.     The 
          probability distribution for the number of successes is called a binomial 
          distribution .  1. 
          Which of the following situations can be modeled using a binomial experiment? 
          Explain.   a. 
          Administering a cold medication with a success rate of 0.90 to ten people 
          with colds and observing the       number 
          of cures [binomial]  b. 
          Tossing a thumbtack eight times and observing the number of times it 
          lands point up   c. 
          Guessing on a ten-question true-false test and observing the number 
          of correct answers   d. 
          Tossing a die six times and observing the numbers of 3's that result [binomial]   e 
          Observing a baseball player with a 0.400 batting average and counting 
          the number of base hits he gets [not
        binomial]   f. 
          Forty percent of all campers at a certain summer camp contract poison 
          ivy. Eight students attend and we      are 
          interested in the number who contract poison ivy.   g. 
          A survey of the residents in a certain town, indicated that 30% of the 
          residents favor building a community       center 
          and 70% are opposed. Ten residents are randomly surveyed and asked if 
          they favor the proposed       new community 
          center. [binomial]   h. 
          A six-sided die is tossed five times and the sum of the faces showing 
          is to be determined.   i. 
          Out of the next ten babies born at Memorial Hospital, the number of 
          males is to be determined.       (Assume

          exploration introduces the notation used for binomial experiments. The 
          following symbols are used to describe binomial experiments:    S = success     F = failure     p = P(S)     1 - p = P(F)     n = number of trials     X = number of successes        The 
          values n and p are called parameters , which 
          completely determine a binomial probability distribution.    1. 
          A cross fertilization of related species of white-flowered and blue-flowered 
          plants produces offspring of     which 20% are white-flowered 
          plants. Six blue- flowered plants were paired and crossed with six white 
              flowered plants, and it was found that there 
          were two white-flowered plants among the six offspring. Is this
            a binomial 
          experiment? If so, identify a trial, a success, and the values for p 
          , n, and X and P(F).  2.

          resulting. She obtained three 1s. Is     this a 
          binomial experiment? If so, what constitutes a trial, a success, and 
          a failure? What are the values of     n, p, and 
          X? [A trial is tossing a die and observing the 
          outcome , S  is observing a 1, and F is observing a     number 
          different from 1.  n = 10, p = 1/6, X = 3, and P(F) = 5/6]   Success  is the term used to 
          describe the outcome of interest for a binomial experiment . It does not necessarily correspond 
          to a "good" event.  3. 
          Suppose a certain type of medication will not cause a skin reaction

          reaction. Identify a     trial,  a success, the values 
          for p and n, and the possible values of X.      Probabilities

As a mathematician, I have never purchased a lottery ticket. I find the odds depressing and have never had luck in winning anything from these kinds of games.  This hub is all about calculating lottery probability or odds. In order to make it more relevant to me, I decided to base it on the Grandlotto 6/55, the lottery game with the biggest prize money here in the Philippines. There will be two different cases discussed in the hub: the probability of winning the game with all six numbers matching, and the probability of having n numbers matching.   Rules of the Lottery Game It is always important to find out the rules of any game before participating in it. For the Grandlotto 6/55, in order to win the jackpot prize, you have to match six numbers from a pool of 55 numbers ranging from 1-55. The initial payout is a minimum of P20 (or around $0.47). It is also possible to win some money if you are able to match three, four, or five numbers of the winning combination. Note that the order of the winning combination here does not matter.  Here is a table for the prizes you can obtain:     No. of Matching Nos.

This is one of the basic concepts you learn in Probability Theory. The main difference being that permutations consider order to be important, while in combinations, order isn't important.  In a lottery ticket, permutation should be used if the numbers in your ticket have to match the order of the draw for the winning string of numbers. In the Grandlotto 6/55, order is not important because so long as you have the winning set of numbers, you can win the prize.  The next formulas only apply for numbers without repetition . This means that if the number x is drawn, it cannot be drawn again. If the number drawn from the set is returned before the next draw, then that has repetition.   This is the formula for Permutations, where order is important. | Source       This is the formula for Combinations, where order is not important. | Source   , where n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.  Note that based on the formulas given, C(n,k) is always less than or equal to P(n,k). You will see later on why it is important to make this distinction for calculating lottery odds or probability.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability for 6 Matching Numbers So now that we know the basic concepts of permutations and combinations, let us go back to the example of Grandlotto 6/55. For the game, n = 55, the total number of possible choices. k = 6, the number of choices we can make. Because order is not important, we will use the formula for combination:   Source   These are the odds or the total number of possible combinations for any 6-digit number to win the game. To find the probability, just divide 1 by the number above, and you will get: 0.0000000344 or 0.00000344%. See what I mean by depressing odds?  So what if we're talking about a different lottery game where order does matter. We will now use the permutation formula to get the following:   Source   Compare these two results and you will see that the odds for getting the winning combination where order matters has 3 additional zero's! It's going from about 28 million:1 odds to 20 billion:1 odds! The probability of winning for this case is 1 divided by the odds which equals to 0.0000000000479 or 0.00000000479%.  As you can see, because the permutation is always greater than or equal to the combination, the probability of winning a game where order matters is always less than or equal to the probability of winning a game where order does not matter. Because the risk is greater for games where order is required, this implies that the reward must also be higher.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability with Less Than 6 Matching Numbers Because you can also win prizes if you have less than 6 matching numbers, this section will show you how to calculate the probability if there are x matches to the winning set of numbers.  First, we need to find the number of way to choose x winning numbers from the set and multiply it by the number of ways to choose the losing numbers for the remaining 6-x numbers. Consider the number of ways to choose x winning numbers. Because there are only 6 possible winning numbers, in essence, we are only choosing x from a pool of 6. And so, because order does not matter, we get C(6, x).  Next, we consider the number of ways to choose the remaining 6-x balls from the pool of losing numbers. Because 6 are winning numbers, we have 55 - 6 = 49 balls to choose the losing numbers from. So, the number of possibilities for choosing a losing ball can be obtained from C(49, 6 - x). Again, order does not matter here.  So, in order to calculate the probability of winning with x matching numbers out of a possible 6, we need to divide the outcome from the previous two paragraphs by the total number of possibilities to win with all 6 matching numbers. We get:       Source   If we write this in a more general form, we get:   Source   , where n = total number of balls in the set, k = total number of balls in the winning combination for the jackpot prize, and x = total numbers of balls matching the winning set of numbers.  If we use this formula to calculate the probability (and the odds) of winning the Grandlotto 6/55 with only x matching numbers, we get the following:     x matches   Calculation   Probability   Odds (1/Probability)   0   C(6,0) * C(49,6)/C(55,6)   0.48237   2.07308   1   C(6,1) * C(49,5)/C(55,6)   0.39466   2.53777   2   C(6,2) * C(49,4)/C(55,6)   0.10963   9.12158   3   C(6,3) * C(49,3)/C(55,6)   0.01271   78.67367   4   C(6,4) * C(49,2)/C(55,6)   0.00060   1643.40561   5   C(6,5) * C(49,1)/C(55,6)   0.00001   98604.33673   6   C(6,6) * C(49,0)/C(55,6)   0.00000003   28989675      How to Choose the Winning Numbers in Lottery As you can see from the math in this hub, the probability of winning the lottery is the same for any 6-number combination available in the Grandlotto 6/55 game. This is also applicable for other lottery games out there.  As I was researching for this hub, I came across links that said never choose numbers that are sequential, like from 1-6 or some such nonsense. There is no such secret to winning the lottery! Each number is as equally likely to come up in the draw as the next number.  If you are willing to face the very little probability of winning the lottery, I say go choose any number you want. You can base it on your birthdays, special days, anniversaries, lucky numbers, etc. Just remember that with great risk comes great reward!

However there are also many factors(known and many unknown) which produces lottery results that happen to produce patterns, which may help in striking like few matching numbers but still ultra difficult in winning 6 matching numbers. It's still a combination of luck, for now i conclude it's combination of probability+luck (L.O.A or whatever u wanna call it)...cheers n good luck hehe  Author dezalyx 2 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Subs. From the definition of classical probability, every statistical outcome will contain elements that are equally likely to happen. This means that if you roll a 6-sided dice, it is equally probable that the outcome will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Or in the case of flipping a coin, the probability of heads will be equal to the probability of tails. No magic coins, no loaded dice, all equally probable to happen. When calculating the lottery probability in this article, this assumption is already used. This is usually the case when calculating probabilities theoretically. Having no affiliation to companies who hold the lottery, it would be difficult for me to assume that certain balls are more likely to surface because they are loaded. In my opinion, historical data does not have any bearing on lottery outcomes. Statistically speaking, working on other probability approaches will not work because of this. Just because the number N appears frequently in lottery drawings, does not mean that the ball is more likely to surface than the number N+1 in the next drawing.  Subs 2 months ago  Can the classical probability theory be used here? And please give an example  Subs 2 months ago  What other probability approaches can be used?  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Odds. Thanks for commenting. I did not say choosing one's birthday would contribute to one's luck. I just said you can choose any number you want if you're willing to face the fact that there's only a very small chance that you can win the jackpot prize. Heck, you could choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 if you wanted to. The basis of this article is that the probability of each ball getting drawn is the same as any other ball in the lottery. While I kept getting comments on how likely certain numbers will get picked over other numbers, mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as having weighted balls for lottery drawings. While you might not have studied mathematics, you certainly were on point when you said that you should never try your luck in gambling. That's actually a mathematician's saying. Never gamble, because the house always wins.  ODDS 7 months ago  I didn't study mathematics, but you were wrong when you mentioned that the numbers of the player's birthday would contribute to his luck, rather it would add up to the improbability, because certainly the player would not live enough to wait his birthday's numbers to come up! And yeah you certainly can top up your chances even if mathematically every number may pop up randomly. If i were to buy a ticket, i would consider not selecting numbers that are altogether evens/odds, divisible by 5 altogether etc. If the order does not matter, you will get more chances! But you know what, never try your luck in gambling, it's made to steal your money and you end up depressed.  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, jazer. I've been receiving a ton of comments lately asking for what the winning number will be for the next lottery draw, but the article is just about the probability of winning the lottery. I don't know about the specifics of the composition of lotto balls, since it probably differs for every company that makes them, but looking for trends when there is no factual basis will just result in you losing money. And given the odds of winning the lottery, you would be better off investing that money in something else with a higher chance of getting a profit. While I agree with the idea that maybe the composition of the balls would get it drawn more than the others, you can never bank on that, since it could be changed without you ever knowing about it (repainting the balls numbers, changing the balls entirely, having different sets of balls for different drawings, etc.).      jazer 8 months ago  Probability is probability. We cannot predict the future. But for the purpose of conversation, some people used they called a "trend". A history of past result. From trend you may "guess" which number can be with higher probability. Is this true in nature? Actually, this is only my opinion. My reasoning with the trend is somewhat related to the composition of the lotto balls e.g. weight, etc, that's why some numbers were drawn more that the others. What is your opinion on this? Thanks.  Kgomotso Comfort 9 months ago  I just want know how can I calculate the probabilities of 6/49  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Edgard, it seems to me that your question is still about the gambler's fallacy. Just because a certain number comes out approximately 6 times out of x number of drawings will not change the probability of the number being drawn again in the future. Imagine changing the game into a simple heads or tails coin flip. The probability of getting either outcome is 1/2. Just because you get 6 heads in a row does not mean the next result would be a tail. Even if you get 100 heads in a row, the probability of getting either outcome is still going to be 1/2. There won't be any probability equations to predict what you are looking for. If there is, the people who have discovered such equations would already be taking advantage of the lottery system. The only thing you can do with the study is plot historical graphs on how many times a certain number has come out previously and marvel at how some numbers seem to appear more than others.  Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalix, We really appreciate your time and answers We are aware that there will always be an average for any set of numbers, also we can find a trend to explain any series of numbers, but these work outs are not a guaranty that we will get really meaningful results. Our previous questions came out from the following fact: We made a sequential review of winning numbers of 260 draws of a 6/45 lottery, to find out the number of times (frequency) that each of the 45 balls was drawn; we started with a 160 draws sample, and increased the sample with 10 draws data each time, until we got the last sample of 260 draws; with every sample of draws, we worked out the rate = [total draws of the sample / frequency of each ball in the sample] for every ball, then we worked out the average of this 45 ratios; the result clearly showed a steady trend for this average, which started at 6.63, for the 160 draws sample, to 6.55 for the 260 draws sample; of course we could work with more sample, but we just decided to stop at 260 draws sample. We initially thought this ratio means the average number of draws we expect to wait for a ball to be drawn; but, what would be the right mining of this average (6.55), if any?, why the average has a steady trend?, and is there any probability equation to predict this average? ratio ni = [N° draws/Freq ni] i = [1, 45] Samples	       Average N° Draws	of ratios      Min ratio  Max ratio 260	                6.55	      4.73            8.97 250	                6.56	      4.63	          8.93 240	                6.57	      4.44	          8.57 230	                6.59	      4.26	          8.85 220	                6.58	      4.31	          8.46 210	                6.59	      4.29	          9.13 200	                6.61	      4.17	          9.09 190	                6.61	      4.13	          8.64 180	                6.62	      3.91	          9.00 170	                6.62	      3.95	          8.95 160	                6.63	      3.81	          8.89 Regards Edgard  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines No. The law of large numbers indicate that given a large number of opportunities, we should expect a certain event to happen again, no matter how unlikely it may be. For example, a set of 6 lottery numbers can get picked 2 weeks in a row. But, just because it happened, doesn't mean you should go running to buy the same exact set of numbers in the hopes of getting lucky. Each lottery picking is still independent of each other. So the probability of picking the correct set of numbers will remain the same for each drawing. Saying that one number has the chance to be drawn every specific number of games is succumbing to gambler's fallacy (mistaken belief that just because something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future). Odds represent the ratio that allow you to calculate how much money you will win on your bet in comparison to your stake. So your $10 ticket can become $23.67 if one number gets drawn. That is why you will notice that the odds keep increasing as you get more matches, meaning you get more money the more matches you get. I hope this answers your question, Edgard.      Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalyx, Thanks again, Regarding the same game 6/45: As the probability of one match is  0.42417, then Odds (1/Probability) will be 2.3678. According to probability theory and the law of large numbers, is it right to say, at least theoretically, that every 2.3678 games we should expect one match; in other words, one number has the chance to be drawn every 2.3678 games?  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Edgar. Just replace the numbers in the formula (from 55 to 45, 49 to 39) then solve for the answer to your question. [0.4241]  Edgard 11 months ago  ¿What would be the probability of one single ball to be part of the winner combination in a game where we have to pick a 6 number combination out of 45 numbers?. Thanks in advance for your answer!  Steve Ho Ong 2 years ago  from Dumaguete City This article is very clear because it is a step by step procedure.
