        Dice Rolling Probability: The chances of rolling dice and its mathematical probability            Dice Rolling Probability basics   Dice Rolling Probability Figuring out the mathematical probability of rolling two dice is a lot easier than you think. If holding two dice in your hands, you'll probably figure this out on your own. Lets make sense of things, and why the dice do what they do.   Dice Roll Odds Understanding dice rolling probability isn't much different than a coin flip probability. A coin has two sides. If you flip a coin,probability dictates that either heads or tails have a 50% chance of coming up. If you choose heads before the flipping of a coin, then there's 1 way of 2 that would happen. It can be written as 1/2, 1 out of 2, or 50% (1 divided by 2).   Dice rolling probability is similar to a coins probability, only with more choices Looking at a die (only one from a pair of dice), you'll see 6 sides. The pips (the little white dots) are 1,2,3,4,5,6.   Take a trip back to high school and revisit fractions An apple pie (my favorite) is cut into 6 slices, and one of these slices contains a $100 bill (eww) - what would your chances be of grabbing that $100 bill? Saying it out loud gives you the answer: One slice out of the 6 slices has the $100. Therefore, that's your odds of grabbing it - 1 out of 6, 1/6, or ~16.67% (1 divided by 6) chance.  That's exactly the probability of one side of a die coming up when you roll it. The probability of at least one of the die coming up a 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 is exactly 1 out of 6.   Probability of rolling two dice Craps actually has two dice, and not anymore complicated than the pie example. There are 6 sides on each die.  There are two of them. Twist and turn each of the dice and you get 36 different variations.    Ever wanted to know the probability of rolling doubles with two dice? A hardway,2 or 12 has exactly a dice rolling probability of 1 out of 36 possibilities. Let's look at this chart, and see how it works. I know it's everywhere, but you can't fight science...    Dice Rolling Probability Chart:    # on Dice Ttl Combinations Combinations/Permutations    2 1 1-1    3 2 1-2    2-1    4 3 1-3    2-2    3-1    5 4 1-4    2-3    3-2    4-1    6 5 1-5    2-4    3-3    4-2    5-1    7 6 1-6    2-5    3-4    4-3    5-2    6-1    8 5 2-6    3-5    4-4    5-3    6-2    9 4 3-6    4-5    5-4    6-3    10 3 4-6    5-5    6-4    11 2 5-6    6-5    12 1 6-6    36 Total Combinations     7 has the most possibilities of coming up. The dice rolling probability can never change in a random roll.  It's the rules of probability . The chances of rolling dice are confined to the above chart. This is the reason 7 rolls more often then any number when you roll two dice randomly. When playing Monopoly, you'll have approximately a 66.7% chance of moving 5-9 spaces (hopefully not into another players' Boardwalk). Why? Because adding up the ways 5,6,7,8, and 9 can roll you get 24 different ways. Since there's only 36 results the dice can roll - you're left with 24 out of 36 ways 5-9 come up. That's 24 divided by 36, equaling .666666... Multiply by 100, and you have ~66.7%. So if exaclty two squares away is the "Go To Jail" square, you don't have to worry much on landing there. But there's always a chance of course (a 1 out of 36, or ~2.78% chance to be precise).  Since the 7 comes up more often than the rest, the casinos capitalize on this. The more random the dice are, the more this is true.     An easy way to remember each numbers' combination Looking at the chart, you see that there are pairs that have the same combinations: 2&12, 3&11, 4&10, 5&9,6&8. Just memorize this, because I'm going to show you a cool trick.  By subtracting 1 from any number from 2 to 7, you get the total combinations: Therefore the dice rolling probability of rolling a 6 with two dice is 5 out of 36 (Or 13.89%).  Knowing the pairs I just mentioned, helps you figure out any dice rolling probability. Viola!   When playing craps, you should keep these combinations in mind For example, most people play the 6 & 8 at the same time. The 6 has 5 different ways of coming up on the dice, and so does the 8 - totalling 10 different permutations. That's 10 out of 36 ways.  Translation - ~27.8% chance of hitting the 6 or 8; and a ~16.7% chance of losing. (dice rolling probability=6/36 ways the 7 can come out).  Others place bets on the "inside" - 5,6,8,9. Using what you know so far, try and figure the chance of winning one of those bets on the next roll. Did you get it? It's 50% because 5&9 have 4 ways each 6&8 has 5, giving you 18 (4+5+5+4) out of 36 ways the dice can come up.  I'm not saying whether these are good bets or bad ones, I'm just getting into the math right now. For some betting strategies, check out How to Win At Craps on this website.

What are the most likely outcomes from rolling a pair of dice?  Assuming we have a standard six-sided die, the odds of rolling a particular value are 1/6. There is an equal probability of rolling each of the numbers 1-6. But, when we have two dice, the odds are not as simple. For example, there's only one way to roll a two (snake eyes), but there's a lot of ways to roll a seven (1+6, 2+5, 3+4).  Let's count how many ways there are to get each value, 2 through 12:    Outcome  List of Combinations  Total    2  1+1  1    3  1+2, 2+1  2    4  1+3, 2+2, 3+1  3    5  1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1  4    6  1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1  5    7  1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1  6    8  2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 6+2  5    9  3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3  4    10  4+6, 5+5, 6+4  3    11  5+6, 6+5  2    12  6+6  1    If we want to calculate the probability of rolling, say, a five, we need to divide the number of ways to get 5 by the total possible combinations of two dice.  How many total combinations are possible from rolling two dice? Since each die has 6 values, there are \(6*6=36\) total combinations we could get. If you add up the numbers in the total column above, you'll get 36.  So, we can calculate the probabilities of each outcome:    Outcome  Probability    2  1/36 = 2.78%    3  2/36 = 5.56%    4  3/36 = 8.33%    5  4/36 = 11.11%    6  5/36 = 13.89%    7  6/36 = 16.67%    8  5/36 = 13.89%    9  4/36 = 11.11%    10  3/36 = 8.33%    11  2/36 = 5.56%    12  1/36 = 2.78%               © 2017 Free Math Help.

June 12th, 2014  If you roll two six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling doubles?  To calculate your chance of rolling doubles, add up all the possible ways to roll doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3; 4,4; 5,5; 6,6). There are 6 ways we can roll doubles, or a probability of 6/36, or 1/6, on any roll of two fair dice. So you have a 16.7% probability of rolling doubles with 2 fair six-sided dice.  You can also think of a sample space of all 36 possible outcomes, with the doubles highlighted:   How about the probability of rolling snake eyes (1,1)? Well, using the sample space above, it’s 1/36. So your odds of rolling snake eyes are about 35 to 1. Not that common!    Click here to view archived puzzles...

When a die is thrown the outcome can be any of the numbers from 1 to 6. If two dice are thrown the set of outcomes that ensure the sum is 9 is {(3, 6), (6,3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}. The total number of possible outcomes is 6*6 = 36  This gives the required probability as 4/36 = 1/9  The probability of getting 9 as the sum when 2 dice are thrown is 1/9.  Problem 2.  A standard deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 aces and 4 queens. The total number of outcomes when two cards are randomly picked is 52*51 = 2652. There are 4 ways in which the first card picked can be an ace. And there are 4 ways in which the second card can be a queen. It is important to notice that the order of picking an ace and a queen is not important here. As a result, we also have to consider the possibility of picking a queen followed by an ace. This gives the total number of ways in which an ace and a queen can be picked as 4*4 + 4*4 = 32. The required probability is 32/2652 = 8/663  When 2 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of cards the probability of picking a queen and an ace is 8/663 .      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    1. In order to get a sum of 9 with two dice, you would have to roll the pairs 4 & 5, 5 & 4, 3 & 6, or 6 & 3. Since you have two dice there are 36 different combinations (6 faces*6 faces) you could roll, but only 4 of them would give you a sum of 9. That makes the probability 4/36 or 1/9 .  2. There are 52 cards in a deck. If you draw two at random you'd have 52 to choose from for your first draw and only 51 for your second. That gives you 2,652 combinations of cards total. Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 4 are aces and 4 are queens. This means you can choose an ace and then a queen (4*4) or a queen and then an ace (4*4). You'll have 32 combinations of an ace and a queen total, giving you a probability of 32/2,652 or 8/663 .                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

 solids and Archimedean duals the obvious
 choices. The die can be "rolled" by throwing it in the air and allowing
 it to come to rest on one of its faces. Dice are used in many games of chance as
 a way of picking random numbers on which to bet,
 and are used in board or role-playing games to determine the number of spaces to
 move, results of a conflict, etc. A coin can be viewed
 as a degenerate 2-sided case of a die.  In 1787, Mozart wrote the measures and instructions for a musical composition dice game. The idea is to cut and paste pre-written measures of music together to create a Minuet (Chuang).   The most common type of die is a six-sided cube with the numbers 1-6 placed on the faces. The value of the roll is indicated by the number
 of "spots" showing on the top. For the six-sided die, opposite faces are
 arranged to always sum to seven. This gives two possible mirror
 image arrangements in which the numbers 1, 2, and 3 may be arranged in a clockwise
 or counterclockwise order about a corner. Commercial dice may, in fact, have either
 orientation. The illustrations above show 6-sided dice with counterclockwise and
 clockwise arrangements, respectively, when viewed from along the three-fold rotation
 axis towards the center of the die.  The cube has the nice property that there is an upward-pointing face opposite the bottom face from which the value of the "roll" can easily
 be read. This would not be true, for instance, for a tetrahedral die, which would have to be picked up and turned over to reveal the number underneath
 (although it could be determined by noting which number 1-4 was not visible
 on one of the upper three faces). The arrangement of spots corresponding to a roll
 of 5 on a six-sided die is called the quincunx . There
 are also special names for certain rolls of two six-sided dice: two 1s are called snake eyes and two 6s are called Boxcars .  Shapes of dice other than the usual 6-sided cube are commercially available from companies such as Dice & Games, Ltd.® Diaconis and Keller
 (1989) show that there exist "fair" dice other than the usual Platonic
 solids and duals of the Archimedean solids ,
 where a fair die is one for which its symmetry group acts transitively on its faces
 (i.e., isohedra ). There are 30 isohedra.  The probability of obtaining points (a roll of ) on  -sided dice can
 be computed as follows. The number of ways in which can be obtained
 is the coefficient of in     (1)     since each possible arrangement contributes one term. can be written
 as a multinomial series     (2)   (3)    so the desired number is the coefficient of in     (4)     Expanding,     (5)     so in order to get the coefficient of , include all
 terms with     (6)      is therefore     (7)     But only when , so
 the other terms do not contribute. Furthermore,     (8)     so     (9)     where is the floor
 function , and     (10)     (Uspensky 1937, pp. 23-24).  Consider now . For six-sided dice,     (11)     and    (12)   (13)   (14)   (15)   (16)    The most common roll is therefore seen to be a 7, with probability , and the
 least common rolls are 2 and 12, both with probability 1/36.  For six-sided dice,     (17)     and    (18)   (19)   (20)   (21)    For three six-sided dice, the most common rolls are 10 and 11, both with probability 1/8; and the least common rolls are 3 and 18, both with probability 1/216.  For four six-sided dice, the most common roll is 14, with probability 73/648; and the least common rolls are 4 and 24, both with probability 1/1296.  In general, the likeliest roll for  -sided dice is given
 by     (22)     which can be written explicitly as     (23)     For 6-sided dice, the likeliest rolls are given by     (24)     or 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, ... for , 3, ... (OEIS A030123 ) dice. The probabilities corresponding

Hi Bruce One way to approach a probability problem is to make a list or description of all the possible outcomes of the experiment, and then calculate the proportion of these possible outcomes satisfy the condition you are looking for, here that the sum is seven. To make this work you need to find a way to list the possible outcomes so that every item on the list has the same probability of occurring. In the experiment of rolling two dice think of one as red and the other as green and list the possible result of the roll in a table. Here, for example, the (3,5) in third row and fifth column means a 3 was rolled on the red die and a 5 on the green die. As the table shows there are 36 possible outcomes.       1 2  3 4  5 6   1  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   2  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   3  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   4  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   5  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   6  (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)     For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

Anthony Bradshaw/Getty Images      Rolling two six-sided dice is common in many of the most popular board games, including Monopoly , Backgammon and The Settlers of Catan. Even if you don't memorize the percentages in the chart below, it's helpful to have a general sense of how common each roll is. When it is your turn and you are two spaces away from landing on an opponent's hotel in Monopoly, this probability chart may comfort you.         Dice Roll Probability The chance of rolling a total of 2 is 2.78 percent The chance of rolling a total of 3 is 5.56 percent The chance of rolling a total of 4 is 8.33 percent The chance of rolling a total of 5 is 11.11 percent The chance of rolling a total of 6 is 13.89 percent The chance of rolling a total of 7 is 16.67 percent The chance of rolling a total of 8 is 13.89 percent The chance of rolling a total of 9 is 11.11 percent The chance of rolling a total of 10 is 8.33 percent The chance of rolling a total of 11 is 5.56 percent The chance of rolling a total of 12 is 2.78 percent There's only one combination that yields a total of 2—when each die displays a 1. Likewise, there is only one combination that yields a total of 12—when each die displays a 6. They are the least likely combinations to occur. As you can see, 7 is the most common roll with two six-sided dice. You are six times more likely to roll a 7 than a 2 or a 12, which is a huge difference.   You are twice as likely to roll a 7 as you are to roll a 4 or a 10. However, it's only 1.2 times more likely that you'll roll a 7 than a 6 or an 8. Another way of looking at these numbers is that, over time, you will roll one 4 or 10 for every two 7s rolled. You'll see six 7s for every 2 or 12. Of course, dice have a bad habit of defying expectations, so don't rely on probabilities from a chart like this to work out your game strategy.         You're likely to find yourself on the losing end of a game if you do.

First lets look at the possibilities of the total of two dice. The table below shows the six possibilities for die 1 along the left column and the six possibilities for die 2 along the top column. The body of the table shows the sum of die 1 and die 2.   Two Dice Totals    Die 1  Die 2    1  2  3  4  5  6    1  2  3  4  5  6  7    2  3  4  5  6  7  8    3  4  5  6  7  8  9    4  5  6  7  8  9  10    5  6  7  8  9  10  11    6  7  8  9  10  11  12      The colors of the body of the table illustrate the number of ways to throw each total. The probability of throwing any given total is the number of ways to throw that total divided by the total number of combinations (36). In the following table the specific number of ways to throw each total and the probability of throwing that total is shown.      Total  Number of Combinations  Probability    2  1  2.78%    3  2  5.56%    4  3  8.33%    5  4  11.11%    6  5  13.89%    7  6  16.67%    8  5  13.89%    9  4  11.11%    10  3  8.33%    11  2  5.56%    12  1  2.78%    Total  36  100%      The following shows the probability of throwing each total in a chart format. As the chart shows the closer the total is to 7 the greater is the probability of it being thrown.   The Field Bet Example  Now that we understand the probability of throwing each total we can apply this information to the dice games in the casinos to calculate the house edge. For example consider the field bet in craps . This bet pays 1:1 (even money) if the next throw is a 3, 4, 9, 10, or 11, 2:1 (double the bet) on the 2, and 3:1 (triple the bet) on the 12. Note that there are 7 totals that win and only 4 that lose which might cause someone who didn't know better to think it was a good gamble.  The player's return can be defined as the sum of the products of the probability of each event and the net return of that event. The following table shows each possible total, the net return, the probability of throwing that total, and the average return. The average return is the product of the net return and the probability. The player's return is the sum of the average returns.      Total  Net Return  Probability  Average Return    2  2  0.0278  0.0556    3  1  0.0556  0.0556    4  1  0.0833  0.0833    5  -1  0.1111  -0.1111    6  -1  0.1389  -0.1389    7  -1  0.1667  -0.1667    8  -1  0.1389  -0.1389    9  1  0.1111  0.1111    10  1  0.0833  0.0833    11  1  0.0556  0.0556    12  3  0.0278  0.0834    Total   1  -0.0278      The last row shows the player's return to be -.0278, in other words for every $1 bet the player can expect to lose 2.78 cents. The player's loss is the house's gain so the house edge is the product of -1 and the player's return, in this case 0.0278 or 2.78%.  For the probabilities in the sum of more than two dice please see my probabilities for 1 to 25 dice section.

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

Dice Rolling Probability: The chances of rolling dice and its mathematical probability            Dice Rolling Probability basics   Dice Rolling Probability Figuring out the mathematical probability of rolling two dice is a lot easier than you think. If holding two dice in your hands, you'll probably figure this out on your own. Lets make sense of things, and why the dice do what they do.   Dice Roll Odds Understanding dice rolling probability isn't much different than a coin flip probability. A coin has two sides. If you flip a coin,probability dictates that either heads or tails have a 50% chance of coming up. If you choose heads before the flipping of a coin, then there's 1 way of 2 that would happen. It can be written as 1/2, 1 out of 2, or 50% (1 divided by 2).   Dice rolling probability is similar to a coins probability, only with more choices Looking at a die (only one from a pair of dice), you'll see 6 sides. The pips (the little white dots) are 1,2,3,4,5,6.   Take a trip back to high school and revisit fractions An apple pie (my favorite) is cut into 6 slices, and one of these slices contains a $100 bill (eww) - what would your chances be of grabbing that $100 bill? Saying it out loud gives you the answer: One slice out of the 6 slices has the $100. Therefore, that's your odds of grabbing it - 1 out of 6, 1/6, or ~16.67% (1 divided by 6) chance.  That's exactly the probability of one side of a die coming up when you roll it. The probability of at least one of the die coming up a 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 is exactly 1 out of 6.   Probability of rolling two dice Craps actually has two dice, and not anymore complicated than the pie example. There are 6 sides on each die.  There are two of them. Twist and turn each of the dice and you get 36 different variations.    Ever wanted to know the probability of rolling doubles with two dice? A hardway,2 or 12 has exactly a dice rolling probability of 1 out of 36 possibilities. Let's look at this chart, and see how it works. I know it's everywhere, but you can't fight science...    Dice Rolling Probability Chart:    # on Dice Ttl Combinations Combinations/Permutations    2 1 1-1    3 2 1-2    2-1    4 3 1-3    2-2    3-1    5 4 1-4    2-3    3-2    4-1    6 5 1-5    2-4    3-3    4-2    5-1    7 6 1-6    2-5    3-4    4-3    5-2    6-1    8 5 2-6    3-5    4-4    5-3    6-2    9 4 3-6    4-5    5-4    6-3    10 3 4-6    5-5    6-4    11 2 5-6    6-5    12 1 6-6    36 Total Combinations     7 has the most possibilities of coming up. The dice rolling probability can never change in a random roll.  It's the rules of probability . The chances of rolling dice are confined to the above chart. This is the reason 7 rolls more often then any number when you roll two dice randomly. When playing Monopoly, you'll have approximately a 66.7% chance of moving 5-9 spaces (hopefully not into another players' Boardwalk). Why? Because adding up the ways 5,6,7,8, and 9 can roll you get 24 different ways. Since there's only 36 results the dice can roll - you're left with 24 out of 36 ways 5-9 come up. That's 24 divided by 36, equaling .666666... Multiply by 100, and you have ~66.7%. So if exaclty two squares away is the "Go To Jail" square, you don't have to worry much on landing there. But there's always a chance of course (a 1 out of 36, or ~2.78% chance to be precise).  Since the 7 comes up more often than the rest, the casinos capitalize on this. The more random the dice are, the more this is true.     An easy way to remember each numbers' combination Looking at the chart, you see that there are pairs that have the same combinations: 2&12, 3&11, 4&10, 5&9,6&8. Just memorize this, because I'm going to show you a cool trick.  By subtracting 1 from any number from 2 to 7, you get the total combinations: Therefore the dice rolling probability of rolling a 6 with two dice is 5 out of 36 (Or 13.89%).  Knowing the pairs I just mentioned, helps you figure out any dice rolling probability. Viola!   When playing craps, you should keep these combinations in mind For example, most people play the 6 & 8 at the same time. The 6 has 5 different ways of coming up on the dice, and so does the 8 - totalling 10 different permutations. That's 10 out of 36 ways.  Translation - ~27.8% chance of hitting the 6 or 8; and a ~16.7% chance of losing. (dice rolling probability=6/36 ways the 7 can come out).  Others place bets on the "inside" - 5,6,8,9. Using what you know so far, try and figure the chance of winning one of those bets on the next roll. Did you get it? It's 50% because 5&9 have 4 ways each 6&8 has 5, giving you 18 (4+5+5+4) out of 36 ways the dice can come up.  I'm not saying whether these are good bets or bad ones, I'm just getting into the math right now. For some betting strategies, check out How to Win At Craps on this website.

The casinogenerally pays you less than true odds, which is how they make a profit. But the Free Odds bets are paid at the actual true odds and thereforecarry no house edge — which is why you should put most of your craps money on theFree Odds bets. In this article Bill Burton explains what True Odds are. Understanding Dice Odds Last time I discussed the basics of playing craps. In order to play the game youobviously need dice. You also need an understanding of the dice and the odds andprobabilities of rolling the numbers. In the movies you will see the players picking up the dice and rolling them togetherin both hands before letting them fly down the table as they scream, “Baby needsa new pair of shoes!” or some other wild chant. This is fine in the movies but ina real casino you are only allowed to handle the dice with one hand. Dice are actuallyprecision instruments manufactured to very strict specifications. They are inspectedfor any flaws such as nicks or chips before being put in to play. Rubbing them togetheror other rough handling can damage dice. If the dice are thrown off the table theyhave to be checked before being put back into play. The average life of a pair ofdice is only about eight hours, and then the casino replaces them to ensure thatthe game dice are fresh and fair. Let’s take a look the dice. They’re cubes, about three quarters of an inch square.One alone is called a die. Each die has spots called “pips” totaling a number fromone to six on each side. If you add the corresponding sides you will get the numberseven. The side with six pips will have one pip on the opposite side. Two and fiveare on corresponding sides as are the three and four. Since each die has six sidesand the game is played with two dice, there are 36 (6 x 6) combinations that canbe made giving totals of two through twelve. Take a look at the Dice Chart: You will see that there is only one way to make the numbers two (1 and 1) and twelve(6 and 6). There are two ways to make the number three: (2 and 1) and (1 and 2).If it helps you to understand the combinations, picture a blue and a red die. Youcould have number one on the red and two on the blue, or number two on the red andnumber one on the blue. There are two ways to make the three and eleven. There are three ways to make the four and ten. There are four ways to make the five and nine. There are five ways to make the six and eight. There are six ways to make the seven. By knowing how the numbers are made, you can calculate the odds of making any numberbefore the seven is rolled. Since the number 7 can be rolled six ways, you dividethe number six by the number of ways a number is rolled.   Number  # ways to roll  True Odds    4  3  2 to 1    5  4  3 to 2    6 or 8  5  6 to 5    9  4  3 to 2    10  3  2 to 1   Once you understand the odds and probabilities of the dice, you are on your wayto mastering the game of craps.

Die 1 : 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Die 2: 1,2,3,4,5,6 So there are three ways we can get 7 and they are : 1+6, 2+5,3+4. The order does not matter as we are concerned about the sum i.e. 7. So 3/36 = 1/12.

There are six possible ways to be 7 i.e. (1+6), (2+5), (3+4), (4+3), (5+2), (6+1) So, total probability is 6/36 or 1/6. Answer is B.

Total number of out comes = 6C1*6C1= 36 We can get a sum of 7 with following sets of number (1,6)(6,1)(2,5)(5,2)(3,4)(4,3) There are 6 such sets So, probability will be 6/36 = 1/6 Answer:-B                           amansiwach79      Intern           Joined: 06 May 2015   Posts: 4                       Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     23 Sep 2015, 07:32      Answer is B. If we considered the probability of the first dice as 1 since any no would have a corresponding no from the other dice to add up to 7. And the second dice P=1/6 hence the probability = 1x1/6=1/6 Would this be a correct approach?

See: how-many-positive-integers-less-than-10-000-are-there-in-85291.html#p639156 The question asks for a sum of 7 between two dice.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 5 stars and 1 bar. ***|** can be arranged in \(\frac{6!}{5!}\)= 6  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{6}{6^2}\) = answer choice B If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 8 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 2, there will be 4 stars and 1 bar. **|** can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{4!}\)= 5  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{5}{6^2}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 15 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, by symmetry it is equivalent to the probability of rolling a total of 6 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice. Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 3 stars and 2 bars. *|**| can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{2!3!}\)= 10  ways. There is a total of \(6^3\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{10}{6^3}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 10 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, you have to be a little careful. First arrange 7 stars and 2 bars, which can be arranged in \(9C2\) = 36 ways. But these 36 ways are including (1,1,8), which can be arranged in 3 ways and (1,2,7), which can be arranged in 6 ways.  After subtracting 9 from 36, the answer to this question becomes \(\frac{27}{6^3}\)                                GMATPrepNow      SVP        P     Joined: 12 Sep 2015   Posts: 2203   Location: Canada                      Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     23 Sep 2015, 13:26        1  This post received KUDOS       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side? (A)     1/12 (B)     1/6 (C)     2/7 (D)     1/3 (E)     1/2 Another approach: Name the dice "die1" and "die2" Now recognize that the value appearing on die1 is somewhat inconsequential , since the value of die2 will determine whether or not the sum is 7. To clarify, for ANY value of die1, there is a unique value that die2 can have that will create a sum of 7. For example, if die1 = 2, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 5 If die1 = 6, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 1 If die1 = 1, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 6 And so on. Notice that for any given value of die1, there is ONE value of die2 that will create a sum of 7. In other words, of the 6 possible values of die2, only 1 will create a sum of 7 So, P(sum is 7) = P(die1 has ANY value AND die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = P(die1 has ANY value) X P(die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = 1 X  1/6 = 1/6 = B Cheers, Brent _________________   Brent Hanneson – Founder of gmatprepnow.com                             Bunuel      Math Expert     V     Joined: 02 Sep 2009   Posts: 44510                            Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     27 Sep 2015, 11:54       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side?

First, probability is just desired outcomes divided by possible outcomes, so you will need to find this ratio. Second, if more than one event occurs, "and" means multiply and "or" means add. In this problem, we want to roll a combined 7. We can accomplish this in a number of ways. We can roll a 1 with our first die and a 6 with our second, a 2 first and a 5 second, a 3 first and a 4 second, a 4 first and a 3 second, a 5 first and a 2 second, or a 6 first and a 1 second. This gives us a total of 6 desired outcomes. Next, we will need to find our possible outcomes. Since we have 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die we should multiply 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Also note, that this is an "and" situation - we roll the first AND second die - so we want to multiply rather than add. Finally, we put desired outcomes over possible outcomes, to get 6/36 as the probability of rolling a combined 7. 6/36 simplifies to 1/6, which is answer (B) . _________________   New to the Math Forum?

Die 1 : 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Die 2: 1,2,3,4,5,6 So there are three ways we can get 7 and they are : 1+6, 2+5,3+4. The order does not matter as we are concerned about the sum i.e. 7. So 3/36 = 1/12.

If we considered the probability of the first dice as 1 since any no would have a corresponding no from the other dice to add up to 7. And the second dice P=1/6 hence the probability = 1x1/6=1/6 Would this be a correct approach?

See: how-many-positive-integers-less-than-10-000-are-there-in-85291.html#p639156 The question asks for a sum of 7 between two dice.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 5 stars and 1 bar. ***|** can be arranged in \(\frac{6!}{5!}\)= 6  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{6}{6^2}\) = answer choice B If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 8 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 2, there will be 4 stars and 1 bar. **|** can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{4!}\)= 5  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{5}{6^2}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 15 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, by symmetry it is equivalent to the probability of rolling a total of 6 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice. Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 3 stars and 2 bars. *|**| can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{2!3!}\)= 10  ways. There is a total of \(6^3\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{10}{6^3}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 10 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, you have to be a little careful. First arrange 7 stars and 2 bars, which can be arranged in \(9C2\) = 36 ways. But these 36 ways are including (1,1,8), which can be arranged in 3 ways and (1,2,7), which can be arranged in 6 ways.  After subtracting 9 from 36, the answer to this question becomes \(\frac{27}{6^3}\)                                GMATPrepNow      SVP        P     Joined: 12 Sep 2015   Posts: 2203   Location: Canada                      Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     23 Sep 2015, 13:26        1  This post received KUDOS       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side? (A)     1/12 (B)     1/6 (C)     2/7 (D)     1/3 (E)     1/2 Another approach: Name the dice "die1" and "die2" Now recognize that the value appearing on die1 is somewhat inconsequential , since the value of die2 will determine whether or not the sum is 7. To clarify, for ANY value of die1, there is a unique value that die2 can have that will create a sum of 7. For example, if die1 = 2, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 5 If die1 = 6, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 1 If die1 = 1, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 6 And so on. Notice that for any given value of die1, there is ONE value of die2 that will create a sum of 7. In other words, of the 6 possible values of die2, only 1 will create a sum of 7 So, P(sum is 7) = P(die1 has ANY value AND die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = P(die1 has ANY value) X P(die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = 1 X  1/6 = 1/6 = B Cheers, Brent _________________   Brent Hanneson – Founder of gmatprepnow.com                             Bunuel      Math Expert     V     Joined: 02 Sep 2009   Posts: 44510                            Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     27 Sep 2015, 11:54       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side?

First, probability is just desired outcomes divided by possible outcomes, so you will need to find this ratio. Second, if more than one event occurs, "and" means multiply and "or" means add. In this problem, we want to roll a combined 7. We can accomplish this in a number of ways. We can roll a 1 with our first die and a 6 with our second, a 2 first and a 5 second, a 3 first and a 4 second, a 4 first and a 3 second, a 5 first and a 2 second, or a 6 first and a 1 second. This gives us a total of 6 desired outcomes. Next, we will need to find our possible outcomes. Since we have 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die we should multiply 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Also note, that this is an "and" situation - we roll the first AND second die - so we want to multiply rather than add. Finally, we put desired outcomes over possible outcomes, to get 6/36 as the probability of rolling a combined 7. 6/36 simplifies to 1/6, which is answer (B) . _________________   New to the Math Forum?

and the Laws of Probability   by  Edward
D. Collins   For more questions and problems regarding dice (and coin)
probabilities, please see this page.           Let's
imagine you are playing a game which uses dice.  You are about to roll
three of them. You NEED to roll at least one 6. A 6 appearing on
any one (or more) of the three dice will win the game for you! What are
your chances?    33.3
%    42.1
%    50
%    66.6
%    Quite
some time ago, I was over at a friend's house watching him and another
friend play a board game called Axis & Allies. At one point this exact scenario came up - Kent was planning on rolling
three dice and really wanted at least one 6 to appear. He made a comment that with three
dice, his chances were 3 / 6 or 50%.  Kent's
reasoning was, with one die, the chances of rolling a 6 were 1 / 6 which is correct. He
also believed if he were to roll two dice, his chances were double this
or 2 / 6. This is INCORRECT and
this is where his faulty reasoning begins.  Knowing
a little bit about the laws of probability, I quickly knew the fraction
"2 / 6" for two dice and "3/6" for 
		three dice was incorrect and spent a brief moment computing and then 
		explaining the true percentages.  Unfortunately, I do not
believe I was successful in explaining to Kent why my figures were
correct. Maybe I can do so here.  Obviously,
with Kent's logic above, if the chances of rolling a 6 with two dice is
2 / 6 and the chances of
rolling a 6 with three dice is 3/6, then the chances of rolling a 6
with six dice would be 6 / 6 !!   100%?? Of course, this is obviously
incorrect. I don't care how many dice you roll, the chances of rolling
a 6 will never be 100%.  When
you roll just one die, there are six different ways the die can land,
as shown by the following graphic:                 When
two dice are rolled, there are now 36 different and unique ways the
dice can come up. This figure is arrived at by multiplying the number
of ways the first die can come up (six) by the number of ways the
second die can come up (six). 6 x 6 = 36.  This
graphic shows this very nicely. I've used two different colored dies to
help show a roll of 2-1 is different from a roll of 1-2.                     If
you use the above graphic and count the number of times is 6 appears
when two dice are rolled, you will see the answer is eleven. Eleven
times out of 36 or 30.5 %, slightly less than the 33.3% (2 / 6) Kent thought. When
you roll two dice, you have a 30.5 % chance at least one 6 will appear.  This
figure can also be figured out mathematically, without the use of the
graphic. One way to do so is to take the number of ways a single die
will NOT show a 6 when rolled (five) and multiply this by the number of
ways the second die will NOT show a 6 when rolled. (Also five.) 5 x 5 =
25. Subtract this from the total number of ways two dice can appear
(36) and we have our answer...eleven.  So,
let's use this same method to answer our question and determine the
chances of at least one 6 appearing when three dice
are rolled.  Take
the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the first die...   5 / 6   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the second die...   5 / 6 x 5 / 6 = 25 / 36   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the third die...   25 / 36 x 5 / 6 = 125 / 216   So,
there are 125 out of 216 chances of a 6 NOT appearing when three dice
are rolled. Simply subtract 125 from 216 which will give us the chances
a 6 WILL appear when three dice are rolled, which is 91. 91 out of 216
or 42.1 %, not quite the 50% Kent originally thought.  Here
is a table showing the fractions and percentages of a 6 appearing (or
any other single digit for that matter) and not appearing with several different numbers of dice:                     Chances

What are the most likely outcomes from rolling a pair of dice?  Assuming we have a standard six-sided die, the odds of rolling a particular value are 1/6. There is an equal probability of rolling each of the numbers 1-6. But, when we have two dice, the odds are not as simple. For example, there's only one way to roll a two (snake eyes), but there's a lot of ways to roll a seven (1+6, 2+5, 3+4).  Let's count how many ways there are to get each value, 2 through 12:    Outcome  List of Combinations  Total    2  1+1  1    3  1+2, 2+1  2    4  1+3, 2+2, 3+1  3    5  1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1  4    6  1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1  5    7  1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1  6    8  2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 6+2  5    9  3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3  4    10  4+6, 5+5, 6+4  3    11  5+6, 6+5  2    12  6+6  1    If we want to calculate the probability of rolling, say, a five, we need to divide the number of ways to get 5 by the total possible combinations of two dice.  How many total combinations are possible from rolling two dice? Since each die has 6 values, there are \(6*6=36\) total combinations we could get. If you add up the numbers in the total column above, you'll get 36.  So, we can calculate the probabilities of each outcome:    Outcome  Probability    2  1/36 = 2.78%    3  2/36 = 5.56%    4  3/36 = 8.33%    5  4/36 = 11.11%    6  5/36 = 13.89%    7  6/36 = 16.67%    8  5/36 = 13.89%    9  4/36 = 11.11%    10  3/36 = 8.33%    11  2/36 = 5.56%    12  1/36 = 2.78%               © 2017 Free Math Help.

Here in this case, we are essentially restricting our sample space to those outcomes where the numbers in the pair are not the same.  How many ways can you add up to $7$ with two dice?  How many ways can you not have rolled a pair?  Take the ratio. – JMoravitz  Jun 2 '17 at 15:30        1      Can you post your two attempts so we can pinpoint where you are making a mistake?

At present, your question has zero context... – Did  Jun 2 '17 at 15:43        1      Going by the posted Answer, how weird of a number that is, and how close it is to $\frac{1}{6}$, I am guessing that the 'total' is not the total from the last roll, but the total of all rolls. So, for example, the total would be 7 if the person rolls 1,1, followed by 2,3. So maybe you were assuming that the 'total' was the total of just the last roll? (that's what I did when reading the question, but apparently that's not what the question meant) – Bram28  Jun 2 '17 at 15:45             Unfortunately so @Bram28... and that answer checks out.  That being said, the question is very poorly worded as the simpler of the questions is the one that most people would immediately assume is the intended. – JMoravitz  Jun 2 '17 at 15:51        |  show 2 more comments          1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  3  down vote       In certain board game, two fair dice are rolled. If a pair of the same number is obtained, the dice are rolled for the second time. The player continues rolling those two dice and he stops when the numbers turn up on the dice are different. Evaluate the probability that a player obtains a total of seven points when he rolls the dice as described.   There are apparently two interpretations of this statement, and I will discuss the probabilities associated with each.  It is not made perfectly clear from the question how exactly the points are calculated.   Possibility 1:  The points are just counted from the final roll and no other rolls matter.   E.g. The sequence of rolls $(1,1),(1,1),(1,2)$ would end in a failure since the "total" here would be $1+2=3$ whereas the sequence of rolls $(1,1),(3,4)$ would be considered a success since the final roll $(3,4)$ has $3+4=7$.  Under this interpretation, we may use a conditional probability argument to convince ourselves that we may look instead at the restricted sample space $\{(1,2),(1,3),\dots,(2,1),(2,3),\dots,(6,4),(6,5)\}$ which has only $30$ members, six of which correspond to success.  This would have the probability be then $\frac{6}{30}=0.2$   If it is hard to convince yourself of this, then you may approach in a more tedious way: letting $p$ be the probability of rolling doubles on a specific roll and $q$ the probability of success on a specific roll, i.e. $p=q=1/6$, we would have the probability as $=q+pq+p^2q+p^3q+\dots+p^nq+\dots = \frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6^2}+\frac{1}{6^3}+\dots = \frac{1/6}{1-1/6}=0.2$, same answer as before     Possibility 2: The points are counted from all rolls combined   E.g. the sequence of rolls $(1,1),(1,1),(1,2)$ would end in a success this time since the "total" here would be $1+1+1+1+1+2=7$ whereas the sequence of rolls $(1,1),(3,4)$ would be considered a failure since the total here is $1+1+3+4=9$.  Under this interpretation, we use a great deal more casework.  Fortunately, the desired total is small and we are guaranteed to have won or lost by the third roll.  The possibilities:   Win on the first roll  Win on the second roll after having rolled (1,1)  Win on the second roll after having rolled (2,2)  Win on the third roll after having rolled (1,1) twice in a row   Convince yourself that there are no other possibilities.  We could not for example win after having rolled $(3,3)$ on the first turn because the total would be $3+3+\dots+a+b>7$.  So then, we continue by counting probabilities and combining for a final total probability of:  $$\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{36}\cdot\frac{4}{36} + \frac{1}{36}\cdot\frac{2}{36}+\frac{1}{36}\cdot\frac{1}{36}\cdot\frac{2}{36} = \frac{3997}{23328}$$  The terms in the above are calculated directly via multiplication principle and direct counting.  For example, the final term corresponds to rolling a (1,1) followed by a (1,1) followed by something which adds to three ( noting that no combination that adds to three will result in a pair ).     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 2 '17 at 16:10       JMoravitz   42k 3 31 75                  Thanks for you detailed explanation.

If holding two dice in your hands, you'll probably figure this out on your own. Lets make sense of things, and why the dice do what they do.   Dice Roll Odds Understanding dice rolling probability isn't much different than a coin flip probability. A coin has two sides. If you flip a coin,probability dictates that either heads or tails have a 50% chance of coming up. If you choose heads before the flipping of a coin, then there's 1 way of 2 that would happen. It can be written as 1/2, 1 out of 2, or 50% (1 divided by 2).   Dice rolling probability is similar to a coins probability, only with more choices Looking at a die (only one from a pair of dice), you'll see 6 sides. The pips (the little white dots) are 1,2,3,4,5,6.   Take a trip back to high school and revisit fractions An apple pie (my favorite) is cut into 6 slices, and one of these slices contains a $100 bill (eww) - what would your chances be of grabbing that $100 bill? Saying it out loud gives you the answer: One slice out of the 6 slices has the $100. Therefore, that's your odds of grabbing it - 1 out of 6, 1/6, or ~16.67% (1 divided by 6) chance.  That's exactly the probability of one side of a die coming up when you roll it. The probability of at least one of the die coming up a 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 is exactly 1 out of 6.   Probability of rolling two dice Craps actually has two dice, and not anymore complicated than the pie example. There are 6 sides on each die.  There are two of them. Twist and turn each of the dice and you get 36 different variations.    Ever wanted to know the probability of rolling doubles with two dice? A hardway,2 or 12 has exactly a dice rolling probability of 1 out of 36 possibilities. Let's look at this chart, and see how it works. I know it's everywhere, but you can't fight science...    Dice Rolling Probability Chart:    # on Dice Ttl Combinations Combinations/Permutations    2 1 1-1    3 2 1-2    2-1    4 3 1-3    2-2    3-1    5 4 1-4    2-3    3-2    4-1    6 5 1-5    2-4    3-3    4-2    5-1    7 6 1-6    2-5    3-4    4-3    5-2    6-1    8 5 2-6    3-5    4-4    5-3    6-2    9 4 3-6    4-5    5-4    6-3    10 3 4-6    5-5    6-4    11 2 5-6    6-5    12 1 6-6    36 Total Combinations     7 has the most possibilities of coming up. The dice rolling probability can never change in a random roll.  It's the rules of probability . The chances of rolling dice are confined to the above chart. This is the reason 7 rolls more often then any number when you roll two dice randomly. When playing Monopoly, you'll have approximately a 66.7% chance of moving 5-9 spaces (hopefully not into another players' Boardwalk). Why? Because adding up the ways 5,6,7,8, and 9 can roll you get 24 different ways. Since there's only 36 results the dice can roll - you're left with 24 out of 36 ways 5-9 come up. That's 24 divided by 36, equaling .666666... Multiply by 100, and you have ~66.7%. So if exaclty two squares away is the "Go To Jail" square, you don't have to worry much on landing there. But there's always a chance of course (a 1 out of 36, or ~2.78% chance to be precise).  Since the 7 comes up more often than the rest, the casinos capitalize on this. The more random the dice are, the more this is true.     An easy way to remember each numbers' combination Looking at the chart, you see that there are pairs that have the same combinations: 2&12, 3&11, 4&10, 5&9,6&8. Just memorize this, because I'm going to show you a cool trick.  By subtracting 1 from any number from 2 to 7, you get the total combinations: Therefore the dice rolling probability of rolling a 6 with two dice is 5 out of 36 (Or 13.89%).  Knowing the pairs I just mentioned, helps you figure out any dice rolling probability. Viola!   When playing craps, you should keep these combinations in mind For example, most people play the 6 & 8 at the same time. The 6 has 5 different ways of coming up on the dice, and so does the 8 - totalling 10 different permutations. That's 10 out of 36 ways.  Translation - ~27.8% chance of hitting the 6 or 8; and a ~16.7% chance of losing. (dice rolling probability=6/36 ways the 7 can come out).  Others place bets on the "inside" - 5,6,8,9. Using what you know so far, try and figure the chance of winning one of those bets on the next roll. Did you get it? It's 50% because 5&9 have 4 ways each 6&8 has 5, giving you 18 (4+5+5+4) out of 36 ways the dice can come up.  I'm not saying whether these are good bets or bad ones, I'm just getting into the math right now. For some betting strategies, check out How to Win At Craps on this website.

June 12th, 2014  If you roll two six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling doubles?  To calculate your chance of rolling doubles, add up all the possible ways to roll doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3; 4,4; 5,5; 6,6). There are 6 ways we can roll doubles, or a probability of 6/36, or 1/6, on any roll of two fair dice. So you have a 16.7% probability of rolling doubles with 2 fair six-sided dice.  You can also think of a sample space of all 36 possible outcomes, with the doubles highlighted:   How about the probability of rolling snake eyes (1,1)? Well, using the sample space above, it’s 1/36. So your odds of rolling snake eyes are about 35 to 1. Not that common!    Click here to view archived puzzles...

When a die is thrown the outcome can be any of the numbers from 1 to 6. If two dice are thrown the set of outcomes that ensure the sum is 9 is {(3, 6), (6,3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}. The total number of possible outcomes is 6*6 = 36  This gives the required probability as 4/36 = 1/9  The probability of getting 9 as the sum when 2 dice are thrown is 1/9.  Problem 2.  A standard deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 aces and 4 queens. The total number of outcomes when two cards are randomly picked is 52*51 = 2652. There are 4 ways in which the first card picked can be an ace. And there are 4 ways in which the second card can be a queen. It is important to notice that the order of picking an ace and a queen is not important here. As a result, we also have to consider the possibility of picking a queen followed by an ace. This gives the total number of ways in which an ace and a queen can be picked as 4*4 + 4*4 = 32. The required probability is 32/2652 = 8/663  When 2 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of cards the probability of picking a queen and an ace is 8/663 .      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    1. In order to get a sum of 9 with two dice, you would have to roll the pairs 4 & 5, 5 & 4, 3 & 6, or 6 & 3. Since you have two dice there are 36 different combinations (6 faces*6 faces) you could roll, but only 4 of them would give you a sum of 9. That makes the probability 4/36 or 1/9 .  2. There are 52 cards in a deck. If you draw two at random you'd have 52 to choose from for your first draw and only 51 for your second. That gives you 2,652 combinations of cards total. Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 4 are aces and 4 are queens. This means you can choose an ace and then a queen (4*4) or a queen and then an ace (4*4). You'll have 32 combinations of an ace and a queen total, giving you a probability of 32/2,652 or 8/663 .                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

 solids and Archimedean duals the obvious
 choices. The die can be "rolled" by throwing it in the air and allowing
 it to come to rest on one of its faces. Dice are used in many games of chance as
 a way of picking random numbers on which to bet,
 and are used in board or role-playing games to determine the number of spaces to
 move, results of a conflict, etc. A coin can be viewed
 as a degenerate 2-sided case of a die.  In 1787, Mozart wrote the measures and instructions for a musical composition dice game. The idea is to cut and paste pre-written measures of music together to create a Minuet (Chuang).   The most common type of die is a six-sided cube with the numbers 1-6 placed on the faces. The value of the roll is indicated by the number
 of "spots" showing on the top. For the six-sided die, opposite faces are
 arranged to always sum to seven. This gives two possible mirror
 image arrangements in which the numbers 1, 2, and 3 may be arranged in a clockwise
 or counterclockwise order about a corner. Commercial dice may, in fact, have either
 orientation. The illustrations above show 6-sided dice with counterclockwise and
 clockwise arrangements, respectively, when viewed from along the three-fold rotation
 axis towards the center of the die.  The cube has the nice property that there is an upward-pointing face opposite the bottom face from which the value of the "roll" can easily
 be read. This would not be true, for instance, for a tetrahedral die, which would have to be picked up and turned over to reveal the number underneath
 (although it could be determined by noting which number 1-4 was not visible
 on one of the upper three faces). The arrangement of spots corresponding to a roll
 of 5 on a six-sided die is called the quincunx . There
 are also special names for certain rolls of two six-sided dice: two 1s are called snake eyes and two 6s are called Boxcars .  Shapes of dice other than the usual 6-sided cube are commercially available from companies such as Dice & Games, Ltd.® Diaconis and Keller
 (1989) show that there exist "fair" dice other than the usual Platonic
 solids and duals of the Archimedean solids ,
 where a fair die is one for which its symmetry group acts transitively on its faces
 (i.e., isohedra ). There are 30 isohedra.  The probability of obtaining points (a roll of ) on  -sided dice can
 be computed as follows. The number of ways in which can be obtained
 is the coefficient of in     (1)     since each possible arrangement contributes one term. can be written
 as a multinomial series     (2)   (3)    so the desired number is the coefficient of in     (4)     Expanding,     (5)     so in order to get the coefficient of , include all
 terms with     (6)      is therefore     (7)     But only when , so
 the other terms do not contribute. Furthermore,     (8)     so     (9)     where is the floor
 function , and     (10)     (Uspensky 1937, pp. 23-24).  Consider now . For six-sided dice,     (11)     and    (12)   (13)   (14)   (15)   (16)    The most common roll is therefore seen to be a 7, with probability , and the
 least common rolls are 2 and 12, both with probability 1/36.  For six-sided dice,     (17)     and    (18)   (19)   (20)   (21)    For three six-sided dice, the most common rolls are 10 and 11, both with probability 1/8; and the least common rolls are 3 and 18, both with probability 1/216.  For four six-sided dice, the most common roll is 14, with probability 73/648; and the least common rolls are 4 and 24, both with probability 1/1296.  In general, the likeliest roll for  -sided dice is given
 by     (22)     which can be written explicitly as     (23)     For 6-sided dice, the likeliest rolls are given by     (24)     or 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, ... for , 3, ... (OEIS A030123 ) dice. The probabilities corresponding

Hi Bruce One way to approach a probability problem is to make a list or description of all the possible outcomes of the experiment, and then calculate the proportion of these possible outcomes satisfy the condition you are looking for, here that the sum is seven. To make this work you need to find a way to list the possible outcomes so that every item on the list has the same probability of occurring. In the experiment of rolling two dice think of one as red and the other as green and list the possible result of the roll in a table. Here, for example, the (3,5) in third row and fifth column means a 3 was rolled on the red die and a 5 on the green die. As the table shows there are 36 possible outcomes.       1 2  3 4  5 6   1  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   2  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   3  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   4  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   5  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   6  (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)     For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

Anthony Bradshaw/Getty Images      Rolling two six-sided dice is common in many of the most popular board games, including Monopoly , Backgammon and The Settlers of Catan. Even if you don't memorize the percentages in the chart below, it's helpful to have a general sense of how common each roll is. When it is your turn and you are two spaces away from landing on an opponent's hotel in Monopoly, this probability chart may comfort you.         Dice Roll Probability The chance of rolling a total of 2 is 2.78 percent The chance of rolling a total of 3 is 5.56 percent The chance of rolling a total of 4 is 8.33 percent The chance of rolling a total of 5 is 11.11 percent The chance of rolling a total of 6 is 13.89 percent The chance of rolling a total of 7 is 16.67 percent The chance of rolling a total of 8 is 13.89 percent The chance of rolling a total of 9 is 11.11 percent The chance of rolling a total of 10 is 8.33 percent The chance of rolling a total of 11 is 5.56 percent The chance of rolling a total of 12 is 2.78 percent There's only one combination that yields a total of 2—when each die displays a 1. Likewise, there is only one combination that yields a total of 12—when each die displays a 6. They are the least likely combinations to occur. As you can see, 7 is the most common roll with two six-sided dice. You are six times more likely to roll a 7 than a 2 or a 12, which is a huge difference.   You are twice as likely to roll a 7 as you are to roll a 4 or a 10. However, it's only 1.2 times more likely that you'll roll a 7 than a 6 or an 8. Another way of looking at these numbers is that, over time, you will roll one 4 or 10 for every two 7s rolled. You'll see six 7s for every 2 or 12. Of course, dice have a bad habit of defying expectations, so don't rely on probabilities from a chart like this to work out your game strategy.         You're likely to find yourself on the losing end of a game if you do.

First lets look at the possibilities of the total of two dice. The table below shows the six possibilities for die 1 along the left column and the six possibilities for die 2 along the top column. The body of the table shows the sum of die 1 and die 2.   Two Dice Totals    Die 1  Die 2    1  2  3  4  5  6    1  2  3  4  5  6  7    2  3  4  5  6  7  8    3  4  5  6  7  8  9    4  5  6  7  8  9  10    5  6  7  8  9  10  11    6  7  8  9  10  11  12      The colors of the body of the table illustrate the number of ways to throw each total. The probability of throwing any given total is the number of ways to throw that total divided by the total number of combinations (36). In the following table the specific number of ways to throw each total and the probability of throwing that total is shown.      Total  Number of Combinations  Probability    2  1  2.78%    3  2  5.56%    4  3  8.33%    5  4  11.11%    6  5  13.89%    7  6  16.67%    8  5  13.89%    9  4  11.11%    10  3  8.33%    11  2  5.56%    12  1  2.78%    Total  36  100%      The following shows the probability of throwing each total in a chart format. As the chart shows the closer the total is to 7 the greater is the probability of it being thrown.   The Field Bet Example  Now that we understand the probability of throwing each total we can apply this information to the dice games in the casinos to calculate the house edge. For example consider the field bet in craps . This bet pays 1:1 (even money) if the next throw is a 3, 4, 9, 10, or 11, 2:1 (double the bet) on the 2, and 3:1 (triple the bet) on the 12. Note that there are 7 totals that win and only 4 that lose which might cause someone who didn't know better to think it was a good gamble.  The player's return can be defined as the sum of the products of the probability of each event and the net return of that event. The following table shows each possible total, the net return, the probability of throwing that total, and the average return. The average return is the product of the net return and the probability. The player's return is the sum of the average returns.      Total  Net Return  Probability  Average Return    2  2  0.0278  0.0556    3  1  0.0556  0.0556    4  1  0.0833  0.0833    5  -1  0.1111  -0.1111    6  -1  0.1389  -0.1389    7  -1  0.1667  -0.1667    8  -1  0.1389  -0.1389    9  1  0.1111  0.1111    10  1  0.0833  0.0833    11  1  0.0556  0.0556    12  3  0.0278  0.0834    Total   1  -0.0278      The last row shows the player's return to be -.0278, in other words for every $1 bet the player can expect to lose 2.78 cents. The player's loss is the house's gain so the house edge is the product of -1 and the player's return, in this case 0.0278 or 2.78%.  For the probabilities in the sum of more than two dice please see my probabilities for 1 to 25 dice section.

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.     Roll  1 die  2 dice  3 dice  4 dice  5 dice    1  1/6 (16.667%)  0  0  0  0    2  1/6 (16.667%)  1/36 (2.778%)  0  0  0    3  1/6 (16.667%)  2/36 (5.556%)  1/216 (0.463%)  0  0    4  1/6 (16.667%)  3/36 (8.333%)  3/216 (1.389%)  1/1296 (0.077%)  0    5  1/6 (16.667%)  4/36 (11.111%)  6/216 (2.778%)  4/1296 (0.309%)  1/7776 (0.013%)    6  1/6 (16.667%)  5/36 (13.889%)  10/216 (4.630%)  10/1296 (0.772%)  5/7776 (0.064%)    7  0 6/36 (16.667%) 15/216 (6.944%) 20/1296 (1.543%) 15/7776 (0.193%)  8  0  5/36 (13.889%)  21/216 (9.722%)  35/1296 (2.701%)  35/7776 (0.450%)   9  0  4/36 (11.111%)  25/216 (11.574%)  56/1296 (4.321%)  70/7776 (0.900%)   10  0  3/36 (8.333%)  27/216 (12.500%)  80/1296 (6.173%)  126/7776 (1.620%)   11  0  2/36 (5.556%)  27/216 (12.500%)  104/1296 (8.025%)  205/7776 (2.636%)   12  0  1/36 (2.778%)  25/216 (11.574%)  125/1296 (9.645%)  305/7776 (3.922%)   13  0  0  21/216 (9.722%)  140/1296 (10.802%)  420/7776 (5.401%)   14  0  0  15/216 (6.944%)  146/1296 (11.265%)  540/7776 (6.944%)   15  0  0  10/216 (4.630%)  140/1296 (10.802%)  651/7776 (8.372%)   16  0  0  6/216 (2.778%)  125/1296 (9.645%)  735/7776 (9.452%)   17  0  0  3/216 (1.389%)  104/1296 (8.025%)  780/7776 (10.031%)   18  0  0  1/216 (0.463%)  80/1296 (6.173%)  780/7776 (10.031%)   19  0  0  0  56/1296 (4.321%)  735/7776 (9.452%)   20  0  0  0  35/1296 (2.701%)  651/7776 (8.372%)   21  0  0  0  20/1296 (1.543%)  540/7776 (6.944%)   22  0  0  0  10/1296 (0.772%)  420/7776 (5.401%)   23  0  0  0  4/1296 (0.309%)  305/7776 (3.922%)   24  0  0  0  1/1296 (0.077%)  205/7776 (2.636%)   25  0  0  0  0  126/7776 (1.620%)   26  0  0  0  0  70/7776 (0.900%)   27  0  0  0  0  35/7776 (0.450%)   28  0  0  0  0  15/7776 (0.193%)   29  0  0  0  0  5/7776 (0.064%)   30  0  0  0  0  1/7776 (0.013%)  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number or less on a set of so many 6-sided dice. It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

Dice Rolling Probability: The chances of rolling dice and its mathematical probability            Dice Rolling Probability basics   Dice Rolling Probability Figuring out the mathematical probability of rolling two dice is a lot easier than you think. If holding two dice in your hands, you'll probably figure this out on your own. Lets make sense of things, and why the dice do what they do.   Dice Roll Odds Understanding dice rolling probability isn't much different than a coin flip probability. A coin has two sides. If you flip a coin,probability dictates that either heads or tails have a 50% chance of coming up. If you choose heads before the flipping of a coin, then there's 1 way of 2 that would happen. It can be written as 1/2, 1 out of 2, or 50% (1 divided by 2).   Dice rolling probability is similar to a coins probability, only with more choices Looking at a die (only one from a pair of dice), you'll see 6 sides. The pips (the little white dots) are 1,2,3,4,5,6.   Take a trip back to high school and revisit fractions An apple pie (my favorite) is cut into 6 slices, and one of these slices contains a $100 bill (eww) - what would your chances be of grabbing that $100 bill? Saying it out loud gives you the answer: One slice out of the 6 slices has the $100. Therefore, that's your odds of grabbing it - 1 out of 6, 1/6, or ~16.67% (1 divided by 6) chance.  That's exactly the probability of one side of a die coming up when you roll it. The probability of at least one of the die coming up a 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 is exactly 1 out of 6.   Probability of rolling two dice Craps actually has two dice, and not anymore complicated than the pie example. There are 6 sides on each die.  There are two of them. Twist and turn each of the dice and you get 36 different variations.    Ever wanted to know the probability of rolling doubles with two dice? A hardway,2 or 12 has exactly a dice rolling probability of 1 out of 36 possibilities. Let's look at this chart, and see how it works. I know it's everywhere, but you can't fight science...    Dice Rolling Probability Chart:    # on Dice Ttl Combinations Combinations/Permutations    2 1 1-1    3 2 1-2    2-1    4 3 1-3    2-2    3-1    5 4 1-4    2-3    3-2    4-1    6 5 1-5    2-4    3-3    4-2    5-1    7 6 1-6    2-5    3-4    4-3    5-2    6-1    8 5 2-6    3-5    4-4    5-3    6-2    9 4 3-6    4-5    5-4    6-3    10 3 4-6    5-5    6-4    11 2 5-6    6-5    12 1 6-6    36 Total Combinations     7 has the most possibilities of coming up. The dice rolling probability can never change in a random roll.  It's the rules of probability . The chances of rolling dice are confined to the above chart. This is the reason 7 rolls more often then any number when you roll two dice randomly. When playing Monopoly, you'll have approximately a 66.7% chance of moving 5-9 spaces (hopefully not into another players' Boardwalk). Why? Because adding up the ways 5,6,7,8, and 9 can roll you get 24 different ways. Since there's only 36 results the dice can roll - you're left with 24 out of 36 ways 5-9 come up. That's 24 divided by 36, equaling .666666... Multiply by 100, and you have ~66.7%. So if exaclty two squares away is the "Go To Jail" square, you don't have to worry much on landing there. But there's always a chance of course (a 1 out of 36, or ~2.78% chance to be precise).  Since the 7 comes up more often than the rest, the casinos capitalize on this. The more random the dice are, the more this is true.     An easy way to remember each numbers' combination Looking at the chart, you see that there are pairs that have the same combinations: 2&12, 3&11, 4&10, 5&9,6&8. Just memorize this, because I'm going to show you a cool trick.  By subtracting 1 from any number from 2 to 7, you get the total combinations: Therefore the dice rolling probability of rolling a 6 with two dice is 5 out of 36 (Or 13.89%).  Knowing the pairs I just mentioned, helps you figure out any dice rolling probability. Viola!   When playing craps, you should keep these combinations in mind For example, most people play the 6 & 8 at the same time. The 6 has 5 different ways of coming up on the dice, and so does the 8 - totalling 10 different permutations. That's 10 out of 36 ways.  Translation - ~27.8% chance of hitting the 6 or 8; and a ~16.7% chance of losing. (dice rolling probability=6/36 ways the 7 can come out).  Others place bets on the "inside" - 5,6,8,9. Using what you know so far, try and figure the chance of winning one of those bets on the next roll. Did you get it? It's 50% because 5&9 have 4 ways each 6&8 has 5, giving you 18 (4+5+5+4) out of 36 ways the dice can come up.  I'm not saying whether these are good bets or bad ones, I'm just getting into the math right now. For some betting strategies, check out How to Win At Craps on this website.

The casinogenerally pays you less than true odds, which is how they make a profit. But the Free Odds bets are paid at the actual true odds and thereforecarry no house edge — which is why you should put most of your craps money on theFree Odds bets. In this article Bill Burton explains what True Odds are. Understanding Dice Odds Last time I discussed the basics of playing craps. In order to play the game youobviously need dice. You also need an understanding of the dice and the odds andprobabilities of rolling the numbers. In the movies you will see the players picking up the dice and rolling them togetherin both hands before letting them fly down the table as they scream, “Baby needsa new pair of shoes!” or some other wild chant. This is fine in the movies but ina real casino you are only allowed to handle the dice with one hand. Dice are actuallyprecision instruments manufactured to very strict specifications. They are inspectedfor any flaws such as nicks or chips before being put in to play. Rubbing them togetheror other rough handling can damage dice. If the dice are thrown off the table theyhave to be checked before being put back into play. The average life of a pair ofdice is only about eight hours, and then the casino replaces them to ensure thatthe game dice are fresh and fair. Let’s take a look the dice. They’re cubes, about three quarters of an inch square.One alone is called a die. Each die has spots called “pips” totaling a number fromone to six on each side. If you add the corresponding sides you will get the numberseven. The side with six pips will have one pip on the opposite side. Two and fiveare on corresponding sides as are the three and four. Since each die has six sidesand the game is played with two dice, there are 36 (6 x 6) combinations that canbe made giving totals of two through twelve. Take a look at the Dice Chart: You will see that there is only one way to make the numbers two (1 and 1) and twelve(6 and 6). There are two ways to make the number three: (2 and 1) and (1 and 2).If it helps you to understand the combinations, picture a blue and a red die. Youcould have number one on the red and two on the blue, or number two on the red andnumber one on the blue. There are two ways to make the three and eleven. There are three ways to make the four and ten. There are four ways to make the five and nine. There are five ways to make the six and eight. There are six ways to make the seven. By knowing how the numbers are made, you can calculate the odds of making any numberbefore the seven is rolled. Since the number 7 can be rolled six ways, you dividethe number six by the number of ways a number is rolled.   Number  # ways to roll  True Odds    4  3  2 to 1    5  4  3 to 2    6 or 8  5  6 to 5    9  4  3 to 2    10  3  2 to 1   Once you understand the odds and probabilities of the dice, you are on your wayto mastering the game of craps.

Die 1 : 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Die 2: 1,2,3,4,5,6 So there are three ways we can get 7 and they are : 1+6, 2+5,3+4. The order does not matter as we are concerned about the sum i.e. 7. So 3/36 = 1/12.

There are six possible ways to be 7 i.e. (1+6), (2+5), (3+4), (4+3), (5+2), (6+1) So, total probability is 6/36 or 1/6. Answer is B.

If we considered the probability of the first dice as 1 since any no would have a corresponding no from the other dice to add up to 7. And the second dice P=1/6 hence the probability = 1x1/6=1/6 Would this be a correct approach?

See: how-many-positive-integers-less-than-10-000-are-there-in-85291.html#p639156 The question asks for a sum of 7 between two dice.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 5 stars and 1 bar. ***|** can be arranged in \(\frac{6!}{5!}\)= 6  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{6}{6^2}\) = answer choice B If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 8 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 2, there will be 4 stars and 1 bar. **|** can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{4!}\)= 5  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{5}{6^2}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 15 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, by symmetry it is equivalent to the probability of rolling a total of 6 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice. Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 3 stars and 2 bars. *|**| can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{2!3!}\)= 10  ways. There is a total of \(6^3\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{10}{6^3}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 10 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, you have to be a little careful. First arrange 7 stars and 2 bars, which can be arranged in \(9C2\) = 36 ways. But these 36 ways are including (1,1,8), which can be arranged in 3 ways and (1,2,7), which can be arranged in 6 ways.  After subtracting 9 from 36, the answer to this question becomes \(\frac{27}{6^3}\)                                GMATPrepNow      SVP        P     Joined: 12 Sep 2015   Posts: 2203   Location: Canada                      Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     23 Sep 2015, 13:26        1  This post received KUDOS       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side? (A)     1/12 (B)     1/6 (C)     2/7 (D)     1/3 (E)     1/2 Another approach: Name the dice "die1" and "die2" Now recognize that the value appearing on die1 is somewhat inconsequential , since the value of die2 will determine whether or not the sum is 7. To clarify, for ANY value of die1, there is a unique value that die2 can have that will create a sum of 7. For example, if die1 = 2, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 5 If die1 = 6, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 1 If die1 = 1, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 6 And so on. Notice that for any given value of die1, there is ONE value of die2 that will create a sum of 7. In other words, of the 6 possible values of die2, only 1 will create a sum of 7 So, P(sum is 7) = P(die1 has ANY value AND die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = P(die1 has ANY value) X P(die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = 1 X  1/6 = 1/6 = B Cheers, Brent _________________   Brent Hanneson – Founder of gmatprepnow.com                             Bunuel      Math Expert     V     Joined: 02 Sep 2009   Posts: 44510                            Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     27 Sep 2015, 11:54       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side?

First, probability is just desired outcomes divided by possible outcomes, so you will need to find this ratio. Second, if more than one event occurs, "and" means multiply and "or" means add. In this problem, we want to roll a combined 7. We can accomplish this in a number of ways. We can roll a 1 with our first die and a 6 with our second, a 2 first and a 5 second, a 3 first and a 4 second, a 4 first and a 3 second, a 5 first and a 2 second, or a 6 first and a 1 second. This gives us a total of 6 desired outcomes. Next, we will need to find our possible outcomes. Since we have 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die we should multiply 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Also note, that this is an "and" situation - we roll the first AND second die - so we want to multiply rather than add. Finally, we put desired outcomes over possible outcomes, to get 6/36 as the probability of rolling a combined 7. 6/36 simplifies to 1/6, which is answer (B) . _________________   New to the Math Forum?

Die 1 : 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Die 2: 1,2,3,4,5,6 So there are three ways we can get 7 and they are : 1+6, 2+5,3+4. The order does not matter as we are concerned about the sum i.e. 7.

If we considered the probability of the first dice as 1 since any no would have a corresponding no from the other dice to add up to 7. And the second dice P=1/6 hence the probability = 1x1/6=1/6 Would this be a correct approach?

See: how-many-positive-integers-less-than-10-000-are-there-in-85291.html#p639156 The question asks for a sum of 7 between two dice.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 5 stars and 1 bar. ***|** can be arranged in \(\frac{6!}{5!}\)= 6  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{6}{6^2}\) = answer choice B If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 8 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 2, there will be 4 stars and 1 bar. **|** can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{4!}\)= 5  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{5}{6^2}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 15 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, by symmetry it is equivalent to the probability of rolling a total of 6 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice. Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 3 stars and 2 bars. *|**| can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{2!3!}\)= 10  ways. There is a total of \(6^3\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{10}{6^3}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 10 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, you have to be a little careful. First arrange 7 stars and 2 bars, which can be arranged in \(9C2\) = 36 ways. But these 36 ways are including (1,1,8), which can be arranged in 3 ways and (1,2,7), which can be arranged in 6 ways.  After subtracting 9 from 36, the answer to this question becomes \(\frac{27}{6^3}\)                                GMATPrepNow      SVP        P     Joined: 12 Sep 2015   Posts: 2203   Location: Canada                      Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     23 Sep 2015, 13:26        1  This post received KUDOS       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side?

To clarify, for ANY value of die1, there is a unique value that die2 can have that will create a sum of 7. For example, if die1 = 2, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 5 If die1 = 6, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 1 If die1 = 1, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 6 And so on. Notice that for any given value of die1, there is ONE value of die2 that will create a sum of 7. In other words, of the 6 possible values of die2, only 1 will create a sum of 7 So, P(sum is 7) = P(die1 has ANY value AND die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = P(die1 has ANY value) X P(die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = 1 X  1/6 = 1/6 = B Cheers, Brent _________________   Brent Hanneson – Founder of gmatprepnow.com                             Bunuel      Math Expert     V     Joined: 02 Sep 2009   Posts: 44510                            Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     27 Sep 2015, 11:54       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side?

First, probability is just desired outcomes divided by possible outcomes, so you will need to find this ratio. Second, if more than one event occurs, "and" means multiply and "or" means add. In this problem, we want to roll a combined 7. We can accomplish this in a number of ways. We can roll a 1 with our first die and a 6 with our second, a 2 first and a 5 second, a 3 first and a 4 second, a 4 first and a 3 second, a 5 first and a 2 second, or a 6 first and a 1 second. This gives us a total of 6 desired outcomes. Next, we will need to find our possible outcomes. Since we have 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die we should multiply 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Also note, that this is an "and" situation - we roll the first AND second die - so we want to multiply rather than add. Finally, we put desired outcomes over possible outcomes, to get 6/36 as the probability of rolling a combined 7. 6/36 simplifies to 1/6, which is answer (B) . _________________   New to the Math Forum?

and the Laws of Probability   by  Edward
D. Collins   For more questions and problems regarding dice (and coin)
probabilities, please see this page.           Let's
imagine you are playing a game which uses dice.  You are about to roll
three of them. You NEED to roll at least one 6. A 6 appearing on
any one (or more) of the three dice will win the game for you! What are
your chances?    33.3
%    42.1
%    50
%    66.6
%    Quite
some time ago, I was over at a friend's house watching him and another
friend play a board game called Axis & Allies. At one point this exact scenario came up - Kent was planning on rolling
three dice and really wanted at least one 6 to appear. He made a comment that with three
dice, his chances were 3 / 6 or 50%.  Kent's
reasoning was, with one die, the chances of rolling a 6 were 1 / 6 which is correct. He
also believed if he were to roll two dice, his chances were double this
or 2 / 6. This is INCORRECT and
this is where his faulty reasoning begins.  Knowing
a little bit about the laws of probability, I quickly knew the fraction
"2 / 6" for two dice and "3/6" for 
		three dice was incorrect and spent a brief moment computing and then 
		explaining the true percentages.  Unfortunately, I do not
believe I was successful in explaining to Kent why my figures were
correct. Maybe I can do so here.  Obviously,
with Kent's logic above, if the chances of rolling a 6 with two dice is
2 / 6 and the chances of
rolling a 6 with three dice is 3/6, then the chances of rolling a 6
with six dice would be 6 / 6 !!   100%?? Of course, this is obviously
incorrect. I don't care how many dice you roll, the chances of rolling
a 6 will never be 100%.  When
you roll just one die, there are six different ways the die can land,
as shown by the following graphic:                 When
two dice are rolled, there are now 36 different and unique ways the
dice can come up. This figure is arrived at by multiplying the number
of ways the first die can come up (six) by the number of ways the
second die can come up (six). 6 x 6 = 36.  This
graphic shows this very nicely. I've used two different colored dies to
help show a roll of 2-1 is different from a roll of 1-2.                     If
you use the above graphic and count the number of times is 6 appears
when two dice are rolled, you will see the answer is eleven. Eleven
times out of 36 or 30.5 %, slightly less than the 33.3% (2 / 6) Kent thought. When
you roll two dice, you have a 30.5 % chance at least one 6 will appear.  This
figure can also be figured out mathematically, without the use of the
graphic. One way to do so is to take the number of ways a single die
will NOT show a 6 when rolled (five) and multiply this by the number of
ways the second die will NOT show a 6 when rolled. (Also five.) 5 x 5 =
25. Subtract this from the total number of ways two dice can appear
(36) and we have our answer...eleven.  So,
let's use this same method to answer our question and determine the
chances of at least one 6 appearing when three dice
are rolled.  Take
the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the first die...   5 / 6   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the second die...   5 / 6 x 5 / 6 = 25 / 36   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the third die...   25 / 36 x 5 / 6 = 125 / 216   So,
there are 125 out of 216 chances of a 6 NOT appearing when three dice
are rolled. Simply subtract 125 from 216 which will give us the chances
a 6 WILL appear when three dice are rolled, which is 91. 91 out of 216
or 42.1 %, not quite the 50% Kent originally thought.  Here
is a table showing the fractions and percentages of a 6 appearing (or
any other single digit for that matter) and not appearing with several different numbers of dice:                     Chances

you have just over a 50 % chance (51.77) of rolling at least one 6 when
rolling four dice. With six dice it's just over 66 %. Also notice even
when you roll nine dice, rolling a 6 is far from a certainty - you
have just a little better than 80 % chance of rolling this 6. This
means, on the average, even when you roll nine dice, two times out of
ten you will not roll a single 6!  Hope
this helped clear it up, Kent!  Learning the dice probabilities can be really useful when playing all

What are the most likely outcomes from rolling a pair of dice?  Assuming we have a standard six-sided die, the odds of rolling a particular value are 1/6. There is an equal probability of rolling each of the numbers 1-6. But, when we have two dice, the odds are not as simple. For example, there's only one way to roll a two (snake eyes), but there's a lot of ways to roll a seven (1+6, 2+5, 3+4).  Let's count how many ways there are to get each value, 2 through 12:    Outcome  List of Combinations  Total    2  1+1  1    3  1+2, 2+1  2    4  1+3, 2+2, 3+1  3    5  1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1  4    6  1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1  5    7  1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1  6    8  2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 6+2  5    9  3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3  4    10  4+6, 5+5, 6+4  3    11  5+6, 6+5  2    12  6+6  1    If we want to calculate the probability of rolling, say, a five, we need to divide the number of ways to get 5 by the total possible combinations of two dice.  How many total combinations are possible from rolling two dice? Since each die has 6 values, there are \(6*6=36\) total combinations we could get. If you add up the numbers in the total column above, you'll get 36.  So, we can calculate the probabilities of each outcome:    Outcome  Probability    2  1/36 = 2.78%    3  2/36 = 5.56%    4  3/36 = 8.33%    5  4/36 = 11.11%    6  5/36 = 13.89%    7  6/36 = 16.67%    8  5/36 = 13.89%    9  4/36 = 11.11%    10  3/36 = 8.33%    11  2/36 = 5.56%    12  1/36 = 2.78%               © 2017 Free Math Help.

Here in this case, we are essentially restricting our sample space to those outcomes where the numbers in the pair are not the same.  How many ways can you add up to $7$ with two dice?  How many ways can you not have rolled a pair?  Take the ratio. – JMoravitz  Jun 2 '17 at 15:30        1      Can you post your two attempts so we can pinpoint where you are making a mistake?

At present, your question has zero context... – Did  Jun 2 '17 at 15:43        1      Going by the posted Answer, how weird of a number that is, and how close it is to $\frac{1}{6}$, I am guessing that the 'total' is not the total from the last roll, but the total of all rolls. So, for example, the total would be 7 if the person rolls 1,1, followed by 2,3. So maybe you were assuming that the 'total' was the total of just the last roll? (that's what I did when reading the question, but apparently that's not what the question meant) – Bram28  Jun 2 '17 at 15:45             Unfortunately so @Bram28... and that answer checks out.  That being said, the question is very poorly worded as the simpler of the questions is the one that most people would immediately assume is the intended. – JMoravitz  Jun 2 '17 at 15:51        |  show 2 more comments          1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  3  down vote       In certain board game, two fair dice are rolled. If a pair of the same number is obtained, the dice are rolled for the second time. The player continues rolling those two dice and he stops when the numbers turn up on the dice are different. Evaluate the probability that a player obtains a total of seven points when he rolls the dice as described.   There are apparently two interpretations of this statement, and I will discuss the probabilities associated with each.  It is not made perfectly clear from the question how exactly the points are calculated.   Possibility 1:  The points are just counted from the final roll and no other rolls matter.   E.g. The sequence of rolls $(1,1),(1,1),(1,2)$ would end in a failure since the "total" here would be $1+2=3$ whereas the sequence of rolls $(1,1),(3,4)$ would be considered a success since the final roll $(3,4)$ has $3+4=7$.  Under this interpretation, we may use a conditional probability argument to convince ourselves that we may look instead at the restricted sample space $\{(1,2),(1,3),\dots,(2,1),(2,3),\dots,(6,4),(6,5)\}$ which has only $30$ members, six of which correspond to success.  This would have the probability be then $\frac{6}{30}=0.2$   If it is hard to convince yourself of this, then you may approach in a more tedious way: letting $p$ be the probability of rolling doubles on a specific roll and $q$ the probability of success on a specific roll, i.e. $p=q=1/6$, we would have the probability as $=q+pq+p^2q+p^3q+\dots+p^nq+\dots = \frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6^2}+\frac{1}{6^3}+\dots = \frac{1/6}{1-1/6}=0.2$, same answer as before     Possibility 2: The points are counted from all rolls combined   E.g. the sequence of rolls $(1,1),(1,1),(1,2)$ would end in a success this time since the "total" here would be $1+1+1+1+1+2=7$ whereas the sequence of rolls $(1,1),(3,4)$ would be considered a failure since the total here is $1+1+3+4=9$.  Under this interpretation, we use a great deal more casework.  Fortunately, the desired total is small and we are guaranteed to have won or lost by the third roll.  The possibilities:   Win on the first roll  Win on the second roll after having rolled (1,1)  Win on the second roll after having rolled (2,2)  Win on the third roll after having rolled (1,1) twice in a row   Convince yourself that there are no other possibilities.  We could not for example win after having rolled $(3,3)$ on the first turn because the total would be $3+3+\dots+a+b>7$.  So then, we continue by counting probabilities and combining for a final total probability of:  $$\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{36}\cdot\frac{4}{36} + \frac{1}{36}\cdot\frac{2}{36}+\frac{1}{36}\cdot\frac{1}{36}\cdot\frac{2}{36} = \frac{3997}{23328}$$  The terms in the above are calculated directly via multiplication principle and direct counting.  For example, the final term corresponds to rolling a (1,1) followed by a (1,1) followed by something which adds to three ( noting that no combination that adds to three will result in a pair ).     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 2 '17 at 16:10       JMoravitz   42k 3 31 75                  Thanks for you detailed explanation.
