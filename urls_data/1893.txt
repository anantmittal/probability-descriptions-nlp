Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

For the second, you need to be more clear.  Are you asking a practical question about the independence of gender statistics in families or an abstract question assuming that one child's gender is independent of all the others?  If the latter, then $\frac 12$. – lulu  May 26 '16 at 10:46            Are you assuming that each individual birth has a 50/50 chance of being male or female?   Or are you allowing for the fact that various sex selection factors act at conception, or between conception and birth, so that having 4 boys could indicate one of the partners has some factor tending to produce boys? – Colin McLarty  May 26 '16 at 10:49            No biological preference is assumed,50/50 chance for male/female – Hailey  May 26 '16 at 10:50        add a comment |           5 Answers 5     active  oldest  votes            up vote  13  down vote  accepted      Regarding the first question:   A and B are married. They have two kids. One of them is a girl. What
  is the probability that the other kid is also a girl?   This is a classical problem in probability. What makes this question confusing is the fact that the question is ambiguous since there may be no such thing as "the other kid".  Suppose a couple has two children, call then $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$. When you say "one of them is a girl" two possible interpretations are:  #1 Someone told me the couple has at least one girl but I don't know if both children are girls, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl, or if $\mathcal{Y}$ is a girl; the possible cases are GG, GB, BG. I want to compute the probability that both of the couple's children are girls (GG).  or  #2 Someone told me $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl but I don't know if $\mathcal{Y}$ is a boy or a girl; the possible cases are GG, GB. I want to compute the probability that $\mathcal{Y}$ is also a girl (GG).  Now, you can answer each of these questions using, for example, expressions for conditional probabilities (the answers to interpretations #1 and #2 are 1/3 and 1/2, respectively). However, if you are left with a feeling of "sure, I see how you can obtain that result but why isn't my answer correct?" read on.   Interpretation #1:  (This is the one I find interestingly confusing.)  When you first think about the problem you might use the following ( incorrect ) reasoning:   I know at least one of the children is a girl, what is the probability
  that the other child (the child of unknown gender) is also a girl? well,
  shouldn't it be 1/2? I mean, the other child can be a boy or a girl regardless ... right?   One of the problems with this reasoning is that there is no such thing as " the child of unknown gender " (therefore, there is no such thing as " the other child "). In fact, you do not know either of the children's genders (in this interpretation both children have unknown gender!). All you know is that there is a girl in there somewhere, but you do not know which of the two children is the girl. How can you hope to compute the probability that the other child (the child of unknown gender) is a girl if there is no such thing as "the child of unknown gender"? In fact, if you happen to know that $\mathcal{X}$ (or $\mathcal{Y}$) is a girl then you are using a different interpretation of the question (interpretation #2).  The other problem with this reasoning is related to independence. As people have pointed out, given the added overarching assumption that there is at least one girl, "$\mathcal{X}$'s gender" and "$\mathcal{Y}$'s gender" are not independent random variables. This is easy to see since, for example, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a boy then $\mathcal{Y}$ is forced to be a girl with probability 1 (not 1/2). This lack of independence is the reason why you can't say that one of the two children is a boy or girl independently/regardless of the other.  Formal Derivation of Answer to Interpretation #1:  Using the formula for conditional probabilities we have
\begin{align*}
P\big(\text{Both are Girls } \big| \text{ At Least One Girl}\big)&=\frac{P\Big(\big(\text{Both are Girls}\big)\cap\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)\Big)}{P\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)}\\
&=\frac{P\big(\text{Both are Girls}\big)}{P\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)}\\
&= \frac{1/4}{3/4}=\frac{1}{3}.
\end{align*}   Interpretation #2:  I don't think there is anything confusing about this interpretation. You know the $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl and $\mathcal{Y}$ can be a girl or a boy independently of $\mathcal{X}$. In this case, the random variables "$\mathcal{X}$'s gender" and "$\mathcal{Y}$'s gender" are not linked by any added overarching assumption and are independent.  Formal Derivation of Answer to Interpretation #2:  Using the independence of the second child's gender relative to the first child's gender:  \begin{align*}
P\big(\text{Second is a Girl } \big| {\text{ First is a Girl}}\big)=P\big(\text{Second is a Girl}\big)=\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}   Regarding the second question:   Now A and B have 4 children and all of them are boys. B is pregnant.
  So what is the probability that A and B are gifted with a baby girl?
  Is it 1/2 or there will be some conditional probability?   The answer is that the next child's gender is independent of the first four children's genders (by assumption), this is because there is no added overarching assumption involving the next child. The answer is then simply $1/2$. (This is just like in Interpretation #2.)     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Aug 10 '17 at 17:41             answered May 26 '16 at 19:48       Karla H.   503 1 10                  +1 Thanks for the lovely answer to an often asked question.

While I've known the mathematical answer to this problem and have been familiar with the ambiguity of the question for a while, I had always struggled to explain (without math) why the incorrect reasoning was incorrect. In my head the answer was often just "that's not how probability works". I'm glad to have come up with a semi-satisfying non-math-based explanation. – Karla H.  Jun 5 '16 at 18:50            i dont see how is this reliable? i know the answer is right but P(A/B) is calculated only if A and B are dependent, how the events of giving birth of two babies are affecting eachother conditionally ?if someone roll a dice and makes 6, the second toss would never depend on the first. – Abra001  Jun 5 '16 at 19:54             First: you can compute P(A|B) regardless of whether A and B are dependent or not.  Second: You are almost right, without other assumptions two babies can be assumed to have independent gender. However, in this case you are adding another assumption : you can't have two boys. Originally the babies genders are independent but once you start adding assumptions like "you can't have two boys" or "the second baby has to have different gender than the first baby" then the genders can become dependent random variables. – Karla H.

In this case, $A$ is the event that the other kid is a girl, and $B$ is the event that one of the kids is a girl.  $A\cap B$ would be both kids are girls, which has a probability of $\frac14$.  $B$ would be the event that one of the kids is a girl, which has a probability of $\frac34$.  Therefore, the required probability is $\frac{1/4}{3/4}=\frac13$.   And for the second question, we can do it using conditional probability or without.  Using conditional probability:  $A$ be the event that the fifth child is a girl.  $B$ be the event that the first four children are boys.  $P(A\cap B)$ would be $\left(\frac12\right)^5=\frac1{32}$.  $P(B)$ would be $\left(\frac12\right)^4=\frac1{16}$.  The required probability would be $\frac{1/32}{1/16}=\frac12$.  Without using conditional probability:  Notice that event $A$ is independent on event $B$.  Therefore, $P(A)=\frac12$.   Notes  In the first question, the probability in question is the probability that "the other kid is also a girl", making the two events dependent.  However, in the second question, the word other is gone, leaving us with independent events.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 26 '16 at 10:56             answered May 26 '16 at 10:45       Kenny Lau   13.9k 20 44                  and for the second question? – Hailey  May 26 '16 at 10:46        add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Originally there are $4$ equiprobable possibilities: BB,GB,GG,BG.

This is an example where we need to be extra careful using ordinary language to express what we mean mathematically.  Does it mean :   One specific kid is a girl ( for example first born ).  Any one of the two kids is a girl.  Exactly one of the kids is a girl (thanks to drhab's comment)   For 1 we only have the freedom left to consider two cases girl & boy which should be an equi-probable independent event. That is: probability $1/2$.  For 2 it is like sampling one of the letters $\{BB, BG, GB, GG\}$, noticing that it is a $G$ and then wondering what the other would be. As you can see there is only one G which has another G besides it but three which have any 1 G, so here the probability it would be $1/3$.  For 3 it could be if a parent says "I have two children of which one is a girl" it probably is assumed that only one of the kids is a girl and then the probability of second kid to be a girl would be 0.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 27 '16 at 11:41             answered May 26 '16 at 20:49       mathreadler   12.9k 7 17 54              1      There is even a third possibility: one of the kids is a girl could also mean exactly one of the kids is a girl .

[duplicate]         up vote  5  down vote  favorite  1       This question already has an answer here:    In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?  20 answers     My initial thought process: Sample space: GG, GB, BG, BB. I then crossed out BG because it's the same as GB because order doesn't matter here. And because we know one is a girl, there leaves two possibilities left. If the other is a boy, the probability should be 1/2, much like how they deduced it Finding probability of other child also being a boy .  However, I was told by my teacher that the answer is not 1/2 . I'm wondering if any of you guys can see a way in how the question is worded so that it's not 1/2...

The sample space is (and needs to be) $\{BB, BG, GB, GG\}.$  We know one child is a girl, so that rules out BB. That leaves us with a sample space of BG, GB, GG  In which case the probability that the second child is a boy is $\dfrac 23$.   Each of the four outcomes has a probability of $\frac 14$. BG: "Having a boy, and then a girl" is a different outcome than $GB:$ having a girl, and then a boy.  To omit one of the boy-girl/girl-boy pairs leaves a sample space of three, with each outcome having probability of 13, which is not correct. Having a boy-girl pair is twice as likely as having two boys, and twice as likely as having 2 girls, and we can only obtain this by counting all four outcomes as distinct, indeed, distinguishable.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 18 '13 at 15:55             answered Dec 14 '13 at 22:07       amWhy   187k 25 215 427                  I was thinking about that, but why?

If you knew that the older child was a girl, then the sample space would be simply $\{GG,GB\}$, where the older child is listed first, and the probability would indeed be $\frac12$. Similarly, if you knew that the younger child was a girl, the probability would be $\frac12$. If you knew that the taller child was a girl, it would be $\frac12$. But all you know here is that one of the children is a girl; if you list the possibilities in the order older-younger, you can rule out only $BB$. – Brian M.

If we assume that boys and girls are born with equal probability, then the probability to have two girls (and one boy) should be the same as the probability to have two boys and one girl. So you would have two cases with probability 2/3, giving an impossible 4/3 probability for both cases. – Thomas Padron-McCarthy  Jun 1 '16 at 6:48         10      Also, your list "Boy-Boy-Girl, Boy-Girl-Boy, and Girl-Boy-Boy" seems strange.

Strictly speaking, none of the answers are correct. If you make a few assumptions (some of which definitely aren't true for actual families) then you can get 3/8. The answer of 3/8 is an approximate solution, of the "assume a spherical cow" variety. – Glen_b  Jun 2 '16 at 2:26         add a comment |           8 Answers 8     active  oldest  votes            up vote  58  down vote      No, the possible outcomes are
$$\mathsf{BBB, \boxed{\mathsf{BBG}}, \boxed{\mathsf{BGB}}, \boxed{\mathsf{GBB}}, BGG,\mathsf{GBG}, GGB, GGG}$$
wherein $3$ meet the requirement. There are $8$ possible outcomes, all equally likely (if we assume each gender is equally likely).  Hence the choice is $3/8$.  We can also think about it in at least one more way: 
You identified all the possible ways to get 2 boys and one girl. Since the events are disjoint, we can add up the probabilities
\begin{align*}
P(\text{2 boys, 1 girl}) &= P(\mathsf{BBG})+P(\mathsf{BGB})+P(\mathsf{GBB}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{3}{8}.

BBB, BBG, BGG, and GGG could be used as the unordered results, but the middle two would need to be weighted 3x because there are 3 ways that each outcome is possible. – Dan Neely  Jun 2 '16 at 13:41        3      @Randy: Order doesn't matter, which is why the probability of all the combinations with the same frequency distribution of each sex are added together — i.e. all those with two boys and one girl — and then divided by the the total of all possible ones. – martineau  Jun 2 '16 at 13:45             Ok I get it.

You had three permutations. They would be BBB, BBG, BGB, BGG, GBB, GBG, GGB, and GGG. Out of those, the permutations with two boys and one girl are BBG, BGB, and GBB.

However, in the twenty-first century there are numerous other genders and gender identifications.   To assert otherwise would be racist, politically incorrect, and a micro-agression that could, at UCLA, subject one to disciplinary action.  So, let p be the probability of a boy, q the probability of a girl, and r be the probability of one of those other genders, with p+q+r=1.  Assume that genders are independent of previous births.   Not enough space here, but you can lay out the 27 possible outcomes and their probabilities. – richard1941  Jun 8 '16 at 23:13         1      Is it not also discriminant to combine all non-binary genders into one? – asher drummond  Jun 9 '16 at 19:50        add a comment |             up vote  11  down vote      I drew it out this way:   So the answer is $\frac{3}{8}$.  Another way to think about it. After a first boy we need one of each (50%). After a first girl we must have only boys (25%).

So if you had a lottery ticket, it matters whether you had the right combination of numbers. Or in this case, we are asking for the number of boys and girls, rather than the order that they appeared. The Permutations do consider order, so that would be more like a code for a safe that must be done in order, or the letters in a password, or in this case the sequence of genders where BGB would be a different sequence to GBB.  So a combination is like the list of stuff at the beginning of a recipe, and the permutation is the order that you add the ingredients. You can take the same list of things and add them in different amounts and different orders, and it will likely make a big difference to the result.  Working from combinations  Just to add that you can do it via combinations, as you originally thought, but you have to take into account the relative probabilities of those combinations, which derive from the set of permutations. As we have seen from the other answers, there are 3 permutations out of 8 which contain 2 boys and a girl.  But what if we looked at the combinations instead? The combinations of 2 genders among 3 children are:   3 girls  2 girls, 1 boy  1 girl, 2 boys  3 boys   Now for the frequencies   3 girls can only be arranged 1 way, so this is a frequency of 1  2 girls, 1 boy can be rearranged, and the boy can have 3 positions (youngest, middle or oldest). Once we have the position of the boy, the girls are known, so there are 3 positions  1 girl, 2 boys: same logic as above, frequency of 3  3 boys: as with 3 girls, frequency of 1   The total of them all is 8, and the number matching our requirement is 3, giving 3/8ths.  In this question, the easiest and clearest approach was to list out the permutations and count how many matched our requirement. For larger problems, it can be simpler to either quickly collect the easy cases and then look at the permutations for a restricted set, or focus on the possible combinations. This is particularly true when there are more complex options in the construction of the set.  Edit: More on Combinations and Permutations  @WoJ has a question: why does order matter? Suppose they were triplets?  I'm not saying that the chronological order of birth is what matters, only that you have to label them. We generally write permutations as a sequence which maps to an ordering of the variables; if I flip a coin 3 times and the result is HTH then I'm implicitly saying that the sequence represents the flips ordered chronologically. But we could flip 3 coins and order them by size, or by the age of the coin; it's just a way of identifying the different flips so that we can correctly account for the possibilities.  But! You must label them before you consider how they landed . Arranging heads first then tails is already turning the result from a permutation to a combination, and making things much harder by making the result dependent on the values, when they were independent variables at the beginning. So to assess the relationship between the original tosses and the resulting combinations we have to label them first or we'll give ourselves a headache.  We can see that it is the permutations that matter rather than the combinations for random independent coin flips by doing this experiment: flip 2 coins, and if they land the same (2H or 2T), then mark 1 in the 'Same' column. If they land differently (1H 1T) then mark 1 in the 'Diff' column. If the probability is determined by the combinations, then there is only 1 combination (1H 1T) that will give a 'Diff' result, vs 2 (2H and 2T) that give a 'Same' result, and after a few rounds of flips we should see twice as many marks in the 'Diff' column. Feel free to try the experiment; run it maybe 20 times so that it is clear whether the answer is more like 2:1 or like 1:1.  I predict that the result will be 1:1, because the probability is in the coin flip, so we have to look there for the statistical basis of our calculations. The probability is 50/50 of a single independent coin flip. So the first flip (or the flip of the biggest or oldest coin) is 50/50 H or T. Now, given that the first flip was a Head, what will the second be? These are independent coin flips, so the chances are still 50/50. This gives us a second value. Since these are independent flips, we label them differently and draw up either a table of their values, or a list of the permutations:  First
         H    T
2nd  H  0.25 0.25
     T  0.25 0.25  Now we can look at the categorisation of these permutations as combinations:  H       T
 H    2H     1H 1T
 T   1H 1T    2T  So although there are 3 labelled combinations (2H, 2T, 1H 1T), they are not evenly spread among the permutations (HH, TT, HT, TH), and we have already said that in this case the probability is being driven by the permutations, not the combinations. So to correctly account for the probabilities assigned to those combinations, we have to start from the permutations and see how they map to combinations; 2 go to becoming '1H 1T', and one each to '2H' and '2T'. How do they then map to the categories of 'Same' and 'Diff'?  H    T            1H 1T  Diff  = 0.25+0.25
 H   Same Diff   or    2H     Same  = 0.25
 T   Diff Same         2T     Same  = 0.25  And thus we have P(Same) = 0.25+0.25 = 0.5 and P(Diff) = 0.25+0.25 = 0.5.  At no point have we cared how we ordered the coins, only that we could identify them separately because they have independent probabilities assigned to their flips.  Are there cases where you can't get the answer by just looking at the permutations? Yes, absolutely. For example, the permutations are not always neatly equally likely as we have in these constructed problems. The possible colours of socks in my drawer might be Yellow, Green and Black, but I have a lot more Black socks because the world doesn't share my fascination with Green yet. If we looked at the permutations of 2 socks picked from the drawer, we would get YY, YG, YB, GY, GG, GB, BY, BG, BB. If we just naively looked at the permutations we might imagine the chance of getting a matched pair was 3/9, or 1/3. But it is not, because there are a lot more black socks.  We might instead have a lottery ticket, which only matters what the combination is; then looking at the permutations would be a fruitless exercise, as the drawing process enforces the relationship between probability and combination rather than permutation.  Triplets by combination  Do demonstrate the problems of arranging the triplet birth result into combinations before applying the probabilities, let's actually calculate it that way around. We flip 3 coins, and ignoring the chronology arrange them with heads first. The possible results are HHH, HHT, HTT, TTT. 4 combinations.  But how can we apply our probability that each birth is 50/50? By rearranging the order, we are breaking the mapping between an individual birth and the item in the combination; you can see that straight away in that the only way the first coin in our rearranged set can be a T is if all 3 coins came up T, and we know intuitively that that's much less likely than the probability for any given toss being T. Can we still do it? Well, yes, but it's tricky.  The first combination is HHH. What is the chance of throwing HHH? The flips are independent, and these coins can be rearranged however you like, but it will always have to be 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.125. So immediately the HHH combination has a chance of 0.125 instead of 0.25. Just because we have 4 categories, doesn't mean the probability relates to that number in any way.  The same argument applies for TTT. So now we have accounted for 0.25 of the probability out of half the combinations.  What of HHT and HTT? Well, since the chances of H and T are equal, we could relabel H as T and T as H, or call the sides A and B without any loss of generality, so the probabilities must be equal here too; both combinations are 2 of one and 1 of the other. So the remaining 6/8 of the probability give us 3/8 for each option.  What if H and T were not interchangeable? Suppose P(H) was 3/5, not 1/2? We can see that the combinations don't give us a straight answer because they are unchanged (3H, 2H, 1H, 0H) but we know intuitively that the chances of getting 2H must depend on the bias of the coin flip. Here we would have a remaining probability of 1 - 0.4*0.4*0.4 - 0.6*0.6*0.6 = 0.72. The two remaining combinations are HTT and HHT. So we know that the first and last of those coins came out the same, and this is the set of tosses which contain one head and one tail. Removing that head and tail leaves the outcome of a single coin. It doesn't matter which order the coins were tossed in, or even how we reordered them afterwards. The final coin has P(H)=0.6 and P(T)=0.4, so P(H)/P(T) = 1.5. We already have the other two coins, so we have P(2H 1T)/P(1H 2T) = 1.5. Distributing the remaining probability of 0.72 gives us P(2H 1T)+P(1H 2T)=0.72, and we can then substitute to get P(2H 1T)+P(2H 1T)/1.5=0.72, so P(2H 1T)=0.432.  By contrast, to calculate that from the original tosses, we have:  P(2H,1T) = P(HHT)+P(HTH)+P(THH) 
         = .6*.6*.4 + .6*.4*.6 + .4*.6*.6
         = 0.144 * 3 = 0.432  So if we have independent variables (births, coin tosses), it is easiest to look at the permutations and collect the probabilities of the permutations we want than to start from the combinations and work backwards to figure out how their probabilities relate to the individual variable probabilities. But it is not impossible, and in some cases preferable.  TLDR: The important thing is to look at the mechanism by which randomness appears in the system, and to then measure the probabilities from there either in terms of combinations or permutations, but not blindly applying either as the method entirely depends on the mechanism of the randomness. Both approaches can be made to work, but only if you correctly account for the probabilities according to the system you are considering.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 3 '16 at 13:20             answered Jun 1 '16 at 10:05       Phil H   883 1 5 12                  I have a hard time understanding why the order needs to be taken into account at all. Let's imagine they were triplets which were born at the same time. The outcome of this pregnancy can be one of the four you listed. Out of these only one satisfies the requirement, so why isn't the probability 1/4? – WoJ  Jun 2 '16 at 14:00            @WoJ: I have added a further wall of text to answer you. Basically, it's not about chronology but about labelling so that we can apply the probability we know about (that each birth is 50/50 boy or girl). By arranging the results into combinations, you have already skipped the step of relating the individual birth probabilities to permutation probabilities, and thus are not accounting for the given probabilities correctly. If that isn't clear, let me know. – Phil H  Jun 3 '16 at 11:39            I like the idea of having him do a simulation by coin flipping!   A couple hundred trials should be enough to distinguish between 3/8 and 1/3. I wonder if this would be permitted on the exam...  It is almost like cheating.  But I remember a theorem in probability to the effect that anything can be simulated by a sequence of Bernoulli trials. – richard1941  Jun 8 '16 at 23:25         add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      A systematic way to calculate @probablyme s answer to encode the letters B (boy) and G (girl) as a 3 digit binary number with the logical value 1 for true and 0 for false ( that the digit represents a boy ).  Then we loop through all combinations, for example by incrementing by 1  each step.$$000\to001\to010\to011\to100\to 101\to110\to111$$  We then count the total number of "ones" equals 2. This is the same as the "population count" function used in this question and answer .  The output of the function would be:
$$0\to1\to1\to2\to1\to2\to2\to3$$  And as we can see, for 3 of the 8 states the function evaluates to 2. This means that after counting all possibilities, we found that 3 of the 8 equiprobable states correspond to two boys. This gives a probability of $\frac{3}{8}$.   The strength of this approach is of course that if we modify the question to account for more advanced things, these can be included with fast logical bit-wise operations on the numbers!     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:21       Community ♦   1        answered Jun 1 '16 at 16:28       mathreadler   12.9k 7 17 54              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Since the question does not mention the order, the possible combinations are   3 Boys  2 Boys and 1 Girl (3 ways to do it)  1 Boy and 2 Girls (3 ways to do it)  3 Girls   That means the correct answer is 37,5% or 3/8     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 1 '16 at 11:44             answered Jun 1 '16 at 11:37       GodlyHedgehog   1 2                  Did you really compute 37½% before rationalizing it to 3/8? – Anton Sherwood  Jun 7 '16 at 18:50             In my high school some teachers asked to write probability-related values with percentage. – GodlyHedgehog  Jun 21 '16 at 9:58        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      because 'not a boy' is same as a girl (opposite), it could be calculated like this.  $ \binom{3}{2}  (\frac{1}{2})^2(\frac{1}{2})^{2-1} = 0.375 $   $ \binom{n}{k}  (p)^k(1-p)^{n-k} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 2 '16 at 10:36       P_95   1 1              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The following method avoids any need to consider the number of permutations with 2 boys and 1 girl.  3 children must include either at least 2 boys or at least 2 girls (but not both).

The probability that at least one of two children is a boy born in spring is therefore $1 - (1 - \frac 18)^2$ = $\frac{15}{64}$.  The probability that both children are boys born in spring is $(\frac 18)^2 = \frac{1}{64}$. The probability that one child is a boy born in spring and the other is a boy born in one of the other three seasons is $\frac{15-1}{64}$ x $ \frac37$ = $\frac{6}{64}$ (multiplying by $\frac37$ rather than $\frac48$ because $\frac{15-1}{64}$ excludes the case in which the other child is also a boy born in spring). This makes a total joint probability of two boys and at least one boy born in spring of $\frac{7}{64}$.  The desired conditional probability is therefore $\frac{7}{64}$ / $\frac{15}{64}$ = $\frac{7}{15}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 19 '12 at 8:42             answered Sep 18 '12 at 21:50       Adam Bailey   1,604 11 17                  you get  boy born in spring and the other boy born in another season is $14/64\times 3/7$.

Judging from the probabilities 0.25 of both boys and 0.75 of at least 1 boy, I can surely say that P(boy) = 0.5 and P(girl)=0.5 .  I presume that you are asking how is the probability of both boys given that at least 1 boy is born in spring = $\frac{7}{15}$  Now, since the word "spring" is somehow introduced, lets assume that it is possible for a child to be born in any of the 4 seasons with equal probability.  Lets now have a look at the sample space:  A = All events in Set(Both Boys | One is born in Spring) = 2*(Boys in Autumn, Winter, Summer) + (Both boys in Spring)  B = All events in Set (One Boy born in Spring) = 2*(Boys in Autumn, Winter, Summer) + (Both boys in Spring) + 2*(Girl in Autumn, Winter, Summer, Spring)  Hence, Probability of (Both Boys|One boy is born in spring) = $\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}$  We assume no chance of twins.

Suppose there is a birthday party to which all of the girls (and none of the boys) in a small town are invited. If you run into a mother who has dropped off a kid at this birthday party and who has two children, the chance that she has two girls is $1/3$. Why? $3/4$ of the mothers with two children will have a daughter at the birthday party, the ones with two girls ($1/4$ of the total mothers with two children) and the ones with one girl and one boy ($1/2$ of the total mothers with two children). Out of these $3/4$ of the mothers, $1/3$ have two girls.  On the other hand, if the birthday party is only for fifth-grade girls, you get a different answer. Assuming there are no siblings who are both in the fifth grade, the answer in this case is $1/2$. The child in fifth grade is a girl, but the other child has probability $1/2$ of being a girl. Situations of this kind arise in real life much more commonly than situations of the other kind, so the answer of $1/3$ is quite nonintuitive.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '10 at 1:54             answered Dec 23 '10 at 1:05       Peter Shor   2,466 14 22              add a comment |             up vote  60  down vote      In a family with 2 children there are four possibilities:  1) the first child is a boy and the second child is a boy (bb)  2) the first child is a boy and the second child is a girl (bg)  3) the first child is a girl and the second child is a boy (gb)  4) the first child is a girl and the second child is a girl (gg)  Since we are given that at least one child is a girl there are three possibilities: bg, gb, or gg.

Of course this is not unique to English, and I think you should be able to find similar similar puzzles in pretty much any natural language.  Here is an example that brings out the difficulty more clearly.  First, consider the following similar puzzle:   A family has two children, Robin and Lindsay. Lindsay is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   In elementary probability class, they teach you to answer this by making a table of the four options  Robin    Lindsay
  B        B
* B        G
  G        B
* G        G  The starred rows are the ones where Lindsay is a girl, and we compute from them that the chance that both children are girls is 1/2.  Now consider this puzzle   A family has two children, Robin and Lindsay. At least one of them is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   The elementary probability method gives the following table, and a probability of 1/3.  The difference is that we gain one more row, compared to the previous puzzle.  Robin    Lindsay
  B        B
* B        G
* G        B
* G        G  After looking at these, you can see that the difficulty of the original puzzle comes because, in English, "one of the children" can mean several different things:   "one" can mean "a particular one". If you read the original puzzle like this, it becomes analogous to the first puzzle I wrote, and the answer will be 1/2.  "one" can mean "at least one". If you read the original puzzle like this, it become analogous to the second puzzle I wrote, and the answer is 1/3.  "one" can mean "exactly one". If you read the original puzzle like this, the answer is 0.   There is a common convention in mathematics that "one" usually means "at least one". For example, this is the sense intended in the following sentence, which is a typical example of mathematical English: "if a natural number $n$ is a multiple of a prime number $p$, and $n = ab$, then one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by $p$."  We would not read this as saying that exactly one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by $p$.  I don't believe this convention is very common in non-mathematical English. If I say, "one of my children is a girl", in normal English this means that the other is a boy. Similar discrepancies between mathematical and non-mathematical English come up with our use of the word "or" and our use of the phrase "if/then".  When we teach mathematics, we have to spend time explaining this mathematical argot to students, so they can use the same English conventions that we do.  Probability puzzles like the one you're asking about rely on these differences of English meaning, rather than on any logical or mathematical problem.  In that sense, they aren't really puzzles, they're just tricks.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 23 '10 at 15:47       Carl Mummert   61.2k 7 116 227                  I now, at last, agree that the correct answer is 1/3.

It's long, but bear with me - after reading this answer, you should feel intuitively-comfortable with almost all other probabilistic fallacies, not just this one.  The first and most important thing is to define what we mean by "probability."  Let's define it to mean "the expected percentage of positive outcomes when repeating an observation over a large sample"  (Go ahead, read that again, more slowly) .  Also, let's call the method we use to chose this large sample the "model."  This may sound trivial, but it has some important implications.  For example, what is the probability you will die before age 40?  According to our definition, this question has no meaning:  we can't observe you multiple times before age forty and record how many times you die.  Instead, we observe other people below age 40, and record how many of them die.  So let's say we observe all other people on earth below age 40 (our model), and find that 1/2 of them die before hitting the big four-oh.  Does this mean the probability of you dying before 40 is 50%?  Well, according to this model, it does!  However, this is hardly a fair model.  Perhaps you live in a first-world country - now when we revise our model to include only people below 40 in first-world countries, your chances become a much-less-grim 1/10 † .  But you are also not a smoker, and don't live in the city, and ride your bike on Sundays with your wife and crazy mother-in-law, which makes your chances 123/4567!  That's much better... however, our model still doesn't take into account that you are also an avid skydiver ;)  † I am pulling these numbers out of nowhere, they are not real statistics.  So the point is, asking for a "probability" only makes sense in the context of a certain model - a way of repeating our observation many times.  Without that, asking for a probability is meaningless.   Now, back to the original question.  Before we can assign a probability, we must choose a model; how are we choosing the families to sample from?  I see two obvious choices, which will lead to different answers:   Consider only families which have two children, one of whom is a girl, and choose one randomly.  Consider only girls who have exactly one sibling, and choose one randomly.   Do you see the difference?  In the first case, every family has the same probability of being chosen.  However, in the second case, the families with two girls are more likely to be chosen than families with only one girl, because every girl has an equal chance of being chosen:  the two-girl families have doubled their odds by having two girls.  If children were raffle tickets, they would have bought two tickets while the one-girl families bought only one.  Thus, we should expect the probabilities in these two cases to be different.  Let's calculate them more rigorously (writing BG to mean "boy was born, then girl):   There are three equally probable family-types: BG , GB , and GG  ( BB was removed from consideration, because they have no girls) .  Since only one of the three has two girls, our chances of having two girls are 1/3 .  We have the same possibilities as above, but now GG is twice as likely as BG or GB .  Thus, the probabilities are GG: 2/4 , GB: 1/4 , and BG: 1/4 , meaning the probability of a girl-sibling is 2/4 = 1/2  (alternatively, we could have noted that there are only two equally-probable possibilities for the sibling:  boy or girl) .   Here lies the fallacy:  the model our intuition assumes is the second one, but the way the problem is worded strongly implies the first one.  When we think in terms of "randomly choosing a family (over a large number of families)," our intuition meshes perfectly with the result.   Let's take a look at another similar problem   In a family of two children, where the oldest child is a girl, what is the probability they are both girls?   Once again, I can see two different, plausible models for observing our random sample:   Consider only families with two children, the oldest of whom is a girl, and choose one randomly.  Consider only girls who have exactly one (younger) sibling, and choose one at random.   So once again, the question strongly implies the first model, though arguments for either could be made.  However, when we actually calculate the probability...   Same as before, but we've also eliminated BG , where the first child was a boy.  This leaves only two equally-probable possibilities, GB and GG .  Thus, the chances are 1/2 .  We've also eliminated BG from this case, leaving GB and GG .  However, unlike the original question, GG is no longer twice as likely, since the younger child can no longer be the one who was randomly chosen.  Thus, GB and GG are equally likely, and we again have a probability of 1/2  (alternatively, we could have noted that there are only two equally-probable possibilities for the sibling:  boy or girl) .   ...we find that the choice between these two models doesn't matter, because in this case both have the same probability!  Among two-child families with an older daughter, it doesn't matter if we randomly choose the family or the older-daughter, because in both cases there is only one of each per family.   Hopefully that all made sense.  For bonus points, try applying this reasoning to the Monty Hall problem.  What is our model - how are we making repeated observations?  Why does it clash with our intuition?  For even more bonus points, try to figure out the following question; the math isn't too difficult, but it took me a long while to figure out why, intuitively, the answer should be correct:   In a family of two children, one of whom is a girl named Florida, what are the chances of two girls?

Mathematically, there is no problem at all. Once we list the possible events and the favorable events, the probability is just the corresponding fraction. So the difficulty in these puzzles is just that English hasn't evolved a clear way to describe a probability space. There are two reasonable probability spaces here, and usual English is not clear about which of them is intended. But regardless what anyone knows about the children, I can still compute the probabilities in both these spaces, to get 1/3 and 1/2, respectively. – Carl Mummert  Dec 23 '10 at 15:06             @Carl: Then you must believe that the Monty Hall problem is ambiguous in exactly the same way, no?  I'm afraid I have to disagree with that. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Dec 23 '10 at 17:15         2      I do feel that the difficulty in the Monty Hall problem is also not "mathematical", in the sense that as soon as any probability model has been rigorously stated then the probabilities can be calculated using basic methods. The arguments about the Monty Hall problem stem from a lack of rigour in the statement, which I think is often intentional in order to make an otherwise easy probability exercise into a "puzzle". – Carl Mummert  Dec 23 '10 at 17:44            @Carl: In both cases, it's not that it's ambiguous or not mathematically-defined, it's just counter-intuitive. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Dec 23 '10 at 21:29        2      The two puzzles are similar, and you've made a nice comparison.  They each have two simple probability models, and it's clear which gives the clever, counter-intuitive solution.  But if you admit any more complexity, there's a lot of ambiguity in both problems.  For example, given a room full of people convinced that switching doors is the right strategy, an adversarial Monty Hall can make sure no one wins by offering the switch only to those who first choose the car.  In real life, I would assume ratings and TV gimmicks affect what choices I'm given, and I have no probability model for that! – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 23 '10 at 23:04        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  10  down vote      Here's some idea.  Suppose you sample $4n$ families with two children, where $n$ is a very large integer. Then, with a very high probability, about $n$ of them have two boys, about $n$ have two girls, and about $2n$ have one girl and one boy.
Since you ignore the families with two boys, the desired probability is given by $n/(3n) = 1/3$.  EDIT: The above solution corresponds to the following situation. You visit a large number of families. In each family, you check if there are two kids. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you check if one of the kids is a girl. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you check if both kids are girls.  EDIT: Among all the OP's examples, only one is relevant here. Namely, "I visit this family. I know they have 2 kids. One of them, a girl, comes into the room. The probability that the 2nd kid is also a girl is 1/2, no?". Well, in this situation the probability is indeed $1/2$, assuming the following interpretation. You visit a large number of families. In each family, you check if there are two kids. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you wait until one of the kids comes into the room. If it is a boy, you ignore this family; otherwise you check if both kids are girls. It is readily understood that this leads to a probability of $1/2$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 21 '10 at 13:52             answered Dec 21 '10 at 12:47       Shai Covo   20.7k 1 27 52              4      Of course, a lot depends on how we interpret the question. – Shai Covo  Dec 21 '10 at 12:52        1      @NotSuper: It all depends a lot on the precise formulation, as Shai already pointed out.

(The original question is a little ambiguous, but I agree that 1/3 is the best answer.)  The marble example and the example of the firstborn daughter are the same situation-- the second trial is independent, and the odds are 1/2.  In these cases you know the first trial is independent, and you can ignore it.  The original question intends you to imagine a randomly chosen 2 child family from among all families with at least 1 daughter.  For example, suppose there is a social science study on 2 child families with at least 1 daughter-- in this situation, about 1/3 of the families will be daughter-daughter, 1/3 will be daughter-son, and 1/3 will be son-daughter.  You have to consider the full probability space of two trials (d-d,d-s,s-d,s-s) and eliminate the s-s possibility.  This leaves a 1/3 chance of 2 daughters.  For other variations on this question, you have to decide the appropriate probability space before answering.  (One common, confusing variation is to suppose the family has two children, one of which is a son born on a Tuesday-- what are the odds of two sons?)  In your example where the first child in the room is a daughter, if we suppose that the order the children enter has nothing to do with sex, then the probability the other child is a daughter is 1/2.  However, maybe the family encourages their daughters to play inside and their sons outside-- then you could assume the other child is a son, since he hasn't come in yet.  Maybe the culture has a tradition that the oldest daughter in the household (if there is a daughter) offers guests drinks-- then you know the family has at least one daughter, and the odds that they have another daughter is 1/3.  Once you've chosen your assumptions, you can define the probability space and compute the answer.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 21 '10 at 14:03       Jonas Kibelbek   5,049 1 21 28              1      @Jonas  It isn't at all clear that "The original question intends you to imagine a randomly chosen 2 child family from among all families with at least 1 daughter." Instead I imagined I hadn't seen my nephew in a decade, and we hadn't kept in touch. But I had heard that he had 2 kids and one was a girl. I was going to visit him soon and was wondering about the other child. Girl? or boy? I figured the chances of a girl was 1 in 2, and I still do. I found the Wikipedia article linked to by Rawling enlightening. – NotSuper  Dec 21 '10 at 15:15             @NotSuper: Yes, I agree it's ambiguous.  It is clear that I gave Mlodinow's intended interpretation only because he gave the answer 1/3.  But your nephew scenario is ambiguous as well-- how did you hear that one child is a girl?  You could learn that among their children is at least one daughter (maybe they send an old dollhouse to your grandchildren), which gives 1/3.  Or, you could specify one of their children (oldest, first to answer the phone, etc., as long as it's independent of sex) and learn she is a girl, which gives 1/2. – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 21 '10 at 15:42            These correspond to the two probability spaces described in my answer and in the Wikipedia article.  When you hear that one child is a girl, can you cross off son-son and son-daughter, or can you just cross off son-son?  (With other information and messier probability models, we could get other answers than 1/2 and 1/3 as well.  But these are the two most sensible models to apply.) – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 21 '10 at 15:46             @Jonas "How did you hear that one child is a girl?" I wrote "I had heard that he had 2 kids and one was a girl." I think that implies that someone told me that (or possibly wrote that to me in a letter or email), and that's all I know about my nephew's children. Isn't that the standard interpretation? – NotSuper  Dec 24 '10 at 13:34             @NotSuper: To quote from Carl's answer, "one child" can be interpreted several ways in English: "one particular child," "at least one child," or "exactly one child."  If the letter or e-mail gives you enough context to pick one interpretation, then it's easy to compute the probability.  Your intuitive answer of 1/2 is a correct answer, provided you recognize you are using the "one particular child" interpretation.  But, since this is a puzzle or riddle, the smallest assumption ("at least one child"), which gives the counter-intuitive answer, is the riddler's preferred answer.  Do you agree? – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 24 '10 at 16:34        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  2  down vote      This is really a continuation of BlueRaja's answer, where I'm changing the question slightly to give another illustration of the underlying point.  Consider the following two procedures:  Procedure A: I flip two coins, a nickel and a penny.  After the flip, I
pick one at random, and report its value to you.  Procedure B: I flip two coins, a nickel and a penny.  If exactly one lands
heads, I report that one's value to you, i.e. I say either "the nickel
landed heads" or "the penny landed heads" as appropriate.  If both land
heads, I report on one of them chosen at random.  If neither lands
heads, I say "both landed tails."  Now, if I follow Procedure A and say "the nickel landed
heads", then the probability that the penny landed heads is 50/50.  But
if I say the very same thing after following Procedure B, the
probability that the penny landed heads is 1 in 3.  Now take the following problem:  I flip two coins and say to you "the
nickel landed heads".  What is the probability that the penny landed
heads? Clearly there's no way to answer without knowing or assuming something about the procedure I'm following.  (All this having been said, I agree that the best answer to the original question is 1/3.)     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 22 '10 at 22:47       Larry Denenberg   656 3 10              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?  0%.

In this case we are given that one or both of the children is a girl, but not given any information about which one(s) -- so a simple evaluation of the 4 possible scenarios (for a two-child family) reveals the answer of 33%.  The confusion stems from the slightly ambiguous language used.  The phrase one of the children was used to mean one or both of the children .  Based on that language, our brains trick us into thinking that a specific  one of the children is given and therefore we can evaluate the other child independently.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 6 '13 at 4:24       nobar   101 2                  A link to this Wikipedia article was given in the main comments, but I wanted to point out that the article addresses the psychology of this problem , in an attempt to expose the seeming "paradox" of common intuition. – nobar  May 13 '13 at 2:20             youtu.be/be2wuOaglFY?t=37m0s "This problem is famous for being ill-posed." – nobar  Mar 3 '17 at 1:43            There is some ambiguity about whether I should have said "4 possible scenarios" or "3 possible scenarios". – nobar  Mar 3 '17 at 1:46        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Let $X$ be the event "one of the children is a girl" Let $BG$ refer to the event the family has one boy and one girl (I'm not distinguishing $BG$ and $GB$), and so forth. Everything is conditioned on the family having two children.  $$ P(GG | X) = \frac{P(GG \wedge X)}{P(X)} 
= \frac{P(X|GG) P(GG)}{P(X|GG) P(GG) + P(X|BG)P(BG) + P(X|BB)P(BB)}

1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + P(X|BG) \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}}

$$  (note that I am assuming this isn't taken as a "trick" question, so that $P(X|GG) = 1$ is meant, rather than $P(X|GG)=0$)  So everything boils down to the probability of "one of the children is a girl" given that the family has a boy and a girl.  Now, what does the phrase "one of the children is a girl" mean? There are two typical options   This phrase simply means that this is not an all-boy family. In this case, $P(X|BG) = 1$, and $P(GG|X) = 1/3$.  The phrase means that a particular child was chosen and it could just has easily have been the boy, so that $P(X|BG) = 1/2$, and $P(GG|X) = 1/2$.   In my opinion, an English speaker would almost always interpret the phrase the first way rather than the second way.  However, there is a nasty linguistic trap: even meaning it the first way, we may often pick a girl to be the referent of "one" (e.g. so that we can speak of the "other" child). And since we've picked a girl, we get stuck in the second interpretation. This is exacerbated by the fact the second interpretation has a very appealing shortcut for reasoning out the solution.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 17 '15 at 3:51             answered Oct 17 '15 at 3:37       Hurkyl   102k 8 100 237              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      You have to read carefully.

girl".  Two of them lead to the 1/2 and 1/3 answers which have been discussed
at length, but I found only one brief
answer covering the third
interpretation (though I did only skim).  The meaning of the statement, and consequently the correct answer, can be
altered by considering it to answer different questions.   "How many of your children are girls?"  "One of my children is a girl."  "Is one of your children a girl?"  "Yes, one of my children is a girl."  "Is the child in the stroller a boy or a girl?"  "This one is a girl."   Suppose you've just had the first discussion; what do you think the other child
will be in that case?  There is no chance the other is a girl.  The second question would prompt most people to search their set of children
for a girl and answer "yes" if they can find one or "no" otherwise.
Consequently, out of the 3/4 of two-child parents who can answer yes, about 1/3
of those will have another girl.  However it's conceivable that some kind of contrarian may resolve "one of your
children" even before they have considered the rest of the question, choosing
one at random regardless of its gender, and answering the rest of the question
with respect to that random choice.  This renders the situation equivalent to
the third case.  In the third case, obviously, the gender of the other child is independent of
all the information we have.  So it's a 1/2 chance.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:20       Community ♦   1        answered Feb 22 '17 at 18:54       sh1   117 2                  This is entirely incorrect.

I set $q=P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \mbox{He has $\{B,G\}$})$.  If you sample at family level, then you ask the father if he has at least a daughter or you check official records. In that case $q=1$.  If you sample at child level, by for instance meeting the father in the company of one child or otherwise happening to find out about one child, then $q=1/2$. In this case you will half the time miss this family because you happen to see the son first.  Using Bayes' formula, we get
$$
P(\{B,G\}) \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})
= \frac{P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{B,G\}) P(\{B,G\})}
{P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})}.
$$  Since
$$P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter}) = P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{B,G\}) P(\{B,G\}) + P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{G, G\}) P(\{G, G\}),
$$  we get 
$$
P(\{B,G\} \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter}) = (q \times 1/2)/(q \times 1/2 + 1 \times 1/4) = 2q/(1 + 2q),
$$  and it follows that 
$$
P(\{G, G\} \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})=1/(1 + 2q).
$$  If $q=1/2$, we get $P=1/2$, and $q=1$ gives $P=1/3$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 2 '17 at 18:23       Helmer.Aslaksen   21 2              add a comment |             up vote  -2  down vote      Ok let us consider the unknown. A couple has a girl child. The wife gets pregnant. What are the odds the second child will be a (girl) or (boy).  Now we have reduced the question to a single possibility set.
 the child will have x-x chromosomes
 The child will have x-y Chromosomes  The wife ONLY provides X chromosomes. The husband has the coin toss x or y.
As there is ONLY one coin being thrown (the second x or y in our fair coin toss) then the odds remain 50%. We are NOT Throwing two fair coins to find an answer in this case.  Given a fair coin, the odds are 50% of either outcome, period. We can now use this theory regardless of anything else when asking about the next occurrence (or unknown previous occurrence) as it is separate from any other occurrence and not related in any way. There are TWO options only.  You can stack all the "possibilities and probabilities" you want to, however we KNOW that given a coin toss the next toss has a 50% chance of either outcome. IT is ONLY in looking backward at "n" tosses and in the ORDER of results that any other probability exists and that does not apply to the next toss itself. Having tossed three Y's consecutively does not increase the odds of an X on the next toss, nor reduce it.  Where the first toss is unknown (the second child is a girl) then it still makes no difference...there is an xx, xy possibility genetically as to the first toss. Therefore 50% chance. Ignore english completely...look at the basic problem, unless you care about order or statistics of results over "n" tosses etc.  The ONLY way that one ever has a statistic of 
gg
gb
bg
bb  is when a fair coin is tossed n times and actually create the "expected" result given above. It is not possible to change the odds of "next throw" of a fair coin(s). Only to look backward to the odds that a specific result might be expected over n tosses in a specific order or not. We only have ONE toss involved (next or unknown previous toss) then there is only one possible answer, a 50% chance an x or y chromosome exists.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 26 '16 at 22:55       Djea3   1              add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      It's 1/2 as order is not important, just the physical combination.  i.e. BG == GB.

I dont see any ambiguity with this question. Clearly, the OP, didnt specify the position of the first girl. Even if the OP, asked "...if the Eldest is a girl, that both children are girls?" and we have to include the 'order' of the genders in determining the probability of the 2nd child the answer is still 1/2.  General basis...that there's a 50% chance that the 2nd child is either a boy or a girl(gender is an independent event). Therefore, (ignoring reality that the ratio of boys and girls is skewed in favor of girls) its distribution within a population (multiple events) is equally, half boys and half girls, for the second child.  Proof of this is by looking at genetics. Males, carries the xy chromosomes and xx for the females.  A child can be either xx or xy.  In a family of 2 children then the distribution of chromosomes would be the following combination...  xx xx (all girls) xy xy (all boys) xx xy (a girl and a boy)  *note the 3rd combination, it's not order specific, which also represent the combination xy xx  It's given that one child is a girl therefore we can remove the combination xy xy. We end up with only 2 combination, one of the combination is xx xx (all girls) therefore the chance of that happening is 1/2.  If we have to be specific with the gender order then our combination would be...  xx xx xy xy xx xy xy xx  and "...if the Eldest is a girl..."  a) one child is a girl therefore we can remove the xy xy combination  b) eldest is a girl therefore we can remove the xy xx combination (boy is older)  which leaves us with the following combination....  xx xy xx xx  clearly 1/2  Why 1/3 is wrong...  The original assumption is that there are 4 combinations as oppose to 3. The 4 combinations only applies if the order is specified either the eldest or the youngest.  If the known girl is the eldest then the combination BG has to be excluded for consideration.  If the known girl is the youngest then the combination GB has to be excluded for consideration.  The 1/3 proponent assume that there is no order and represented the boy and girl combination both ways instead of one. Or, there is order but neglected to remove the combination that doesnt represent the actual position of the known girl.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 21 '13 at 8:30             answered Dec 21 '13 at 8:22       nick   1 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

So don't wait until you ovulate. Use our handy dandy ovulation calculator to help you plan to do the deed two or more days before ovulation. Or you could try The Whelan Method , named after Elizabeth Whelan, author of Boy or Girl, which is basically the opposite approach. The Shettles Method boasts a slightly higher success rate of 75 percent at conceiving the child of choice.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

However, if you're not great at dealing with probabilities yet, the numbers involved in this question are so small that you could 'map-out' all of the possibilities. In that way, "brute force" can get you the correct answer rather quickly. Since the probability of having a girl is identical to the probability of having a boy, we don't have to do anything special with the math. The possible outcomes for having 3 children are: B=Boy, G=Girl BBB BBG BGB GBB GGG GGB GBG BGG The question asks for the probability of having 3 children that are ALL the SAME gender (meaning all boys or all girls): Total possibilities = 8 Total with 3 boys or 3 girls = 2 2/8 = 1/4 Final Answer: [Reveal] Spoiler: E GMAT assassins aren't born, they're made, Rich _________________   760+: Learn What GMAT Assassins Do to Score at the Highest Levels Contact Rich at: Rich.C@empowergmat.com       Rich Cohen  Co-Founder & GMAT Assassin   Follow          Special Offer: Save $75 + GMAT Club Tests Free Official GMAT Exam Packs + 70 Pt.

In the family there is already one girl. Then the probability of a second girl is 1/2. Why does it matter whether the girl is the first or the second in the family?. I know that I am wrong but I don´t understand why. _________________  Encourage cooperation!

If it was so, then the probability would indeed be \(\frac{1}{2}\). But here we need to consider following two cases: 1) The first child is a girl In this case there are two possibilities - \(GB, GG\). 1) The first child is a boy In this case there is just one possibility - \(BG\). Notice that \(BB\) is not possible as the question explicitly states that one girl is a child. Hence the probability is \(\frac{1}{3}\). _________________   The buttons on the left are the buttons you are looking for                          eltonj      Intern           Joined: 17 Mar 2015   Posts: 10                      Re: A couple has two children, one of whom is a girl.

If you walk up to a couple and already know that A) they have two children and B) one is a girl.... then half the time they will have two girls and half the time they will have a boy and a girl...

I was having the same problem as eltonj - but after reading through this thread, Bunuel 's last explanation cleared it up. Thank's Bunuel . Here's an interesting link that shows an interesting visual explaining conditional probability: http://setosa.io/conditional/                         TimeTraveller      Senior Manager        B     Joined: 28 Jun 2015   Posts: 298   Concentration: Finance   GPA: 3.5                      Re: A couple has two children, one of whom is a girl. If the probability [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     14 Jul 2015, 06:47      Sample space = {bb,bg,gb,gg} Favourable event = {gg}. Since it's given that one of the child is a girl, the new Sample Space = {bg,gb,gg}. So, probability = 1/3. Ans (C). _________________   I used to think the brain was the most important organ.

Hello HKD1710 Please go Through eshan429 's post probability-217147.html#p1406381 IMHO, I don't feel you need to consider younger /older in this case. The chances of having a twins ( Boy and Girl) in a single delivery can not be rejected. Both Boy and Girl may be born at the same time, we need to consider only the probability of having only 2 daughters ( They may be twins as well - Born on the same day) Younger / Elder daughter is not important in this case , we simply restrict ourself to a female child (daughter) Happy Preparations Abhishek  _________________   Thanks and Regards Abhishek....

So total probability of that event happening is 6*1/16 = 3/8 = A The answer would not change for 2 boys and 1 girl Which will be 3*1/8 = 3/8 _________________  You've been walking the ocean's edge, holding up your robes to keep them dry.

Choosing 2 boys out of 4 leaves 2 girls, hence no additional selection of girls is required. Finally, probability of choosing exactly 2 boys and 2 girls is 1/16 * 6 = 3/8.

You can easily verify this by using the same methodology. There are _ _ _ --> 3 possible spots, 1 for every child. Each of these spots has only 2 possible outcomes occurring with equal likelihood (1/2). This leaves us with a probability of (1/2)^3 =1/8 for every single possible outcome. The next thing to ask yourself is how many of all possible cases include 2 boys (B) and 1 girl (G). The answer is 3 and turns out to be very intuitive if you start to write down a few possible outcomes. GBB BGB BBG All other scenarios will either include 2 girls and 1 boy, 3 boys or 3 girls. Final step is to multiply the probability of each individual outcome with the number of outcomes that satisfy the condition we are looking for. --> 3x(1/8)=3/8                          Temurkhon      Director        G     Joined: 23 Jan 2013   Posts: 592   Schools:  Cambridge'16                       Re: A couple decides to have 4 children.

I mean, I would think BBGG to be the same as BGBG - since the question asks about exactly 2 girls and 2 boys, irrespective of any order of delivery. We have 5 possibilities: 4 boys, 3 boys and 1 girl, 2 boys and 2 girls, 1 boy and 3 girls, and finally all 4 girls. So shouldn't the probability be 1/5? too simplistic - I know. but where am I wrong?

Bump seeking an answer to the question above: I got 1/5 as well. BBBB BBBG BBGG GGGB GGGG 1/5 outcomes The question doesn't say anything about the order. How do we know when order matters? In this case we are saying that the probability of BGGG is the same as the probability of BBGG. But that is not so. You can have 1 boy and 3 girls in 4 ways: BGGG, GBGG, GGBG, GGGB But you can have 2 boys and 2 girls in 6 ways: BBGG, BGGB, GGBB, BGBG, GBGB, GBBG So the probability depends on the number of ways in which you can get 2 boys and 2 girls. Think of it this way: if you throw two dice, is the probability of getting a sum of 2 same as the probability of getting a sum of 8? No. For sum fo 2, you must get 1 + 1 only. For sum of 8, you could get 4 + 4 or 3 + 5 or 2 + 6 etc. So probability of getting sum of 8 would be higher. In the same way, the order matters in this question. _________________  Karishma Veritas Prep | GMAT Instructor My Blog  Get started with Veritas Prep GMAT On Demand for $199 Veritas Prep Reviews                          ManonLi      Intern           Joined: 01 Nov 2014   Posts: 16                      Re: A couple decides to have 4 children.

By ordering I mean bbgg is different from ggbb and repetition happens because b or g can happen more than once. 2.

We can solve this problem in a couple of ways. First, realize that there are 2^4 = 16 total possibilities (boy/girl = 2 options * 4 instances). Next, you can realize that there is 1 way to have all boys and 1 way to have all girls. So the total number of invalid options is 2. Then, if you have 1 boy and 3 girls or if you have 1 girl and 3 boys, then you the chances of these outcomes occurring should be equal. And there are 4 ways to have 1 boy, so there must be 4 ways to have one girl. The total number of invalid cases is 2+4+4 = 10 out of 16 total options. So the number we care about is the remaining number of options with 2 boys and 2 girls = 16-10 = 6. 6/16 = 3/8.                          guialain      Manager        S     Joined: 01 Dec 2016   Posts: 121   Concentration: Finance, Entrepreneurship   Schools:  Insead Sept'18 (A) , Booth (A) , Stern (A)    GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V34     WE: Investment Banking (Investment Banking)                       Re: A couple decides to have 4 children. If they succeed in having 4 child [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     19 Jun 2017, 02:56      I did it the binomial way. Proba of having a girl is same as proba of having a boy, which is 1/2. Proba of having exactly 2 girls and 2 boys is given by 4C2 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6/16 or 3/8. Answer is A The question would be much more interesting if proba of having a girl was 1/3 for instance, and we were asked to find the proba of having exactly 3 girls and 1 boy. In this case the answer would have been: 4C3 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81. Binomial Proba is fast and easy... _________________   What was previously considered impossible is now obvious reality .

Hi Fluke, How does the combination of BGG and GBG vary?

Each child could be boy or girl --> 2 ways for C1; 2 ways for C2; 2 ways for C3. We have total 2x2x2 = 8 ways. It means you considered the order already i.e. BGB # BBG. Thus, when you count the combination (1boy, 2 girls), you have to consider the order . So we have three orders that have 1 boy and 2 girls BGG; GBG; GGB => probability = 3/8 Hope it's clear. _________________  Please +1 KUDO if my post helps. Thank you.

I remember this kind of query coming on from a member  anyways, you pre-arranged the sets here by saying 1 boy and three girls or two boys and two girls  these are not total possible outcomes but rather the sets pre-arranged by you  Plz compare children A,B,C,D may be borne with two independent gender type - male or female  when you say two boys and two girls it's not one outcome, but this is one event  the no of outcomes for this event is 6, two boys and two girls can be formed AB, CD, AD, AC, BD, BC  the same way all your events one boy and three girls -> no of outcomes would be 4C3  all four boys or girls 4C4  anyways, you need to understand the difference between event and outcome here  quit boys and girls, consider each child as a coin and it may land tail/head when tossed - probability 1/2 (independence of events) in any combination the set with probabilities (yes will be boy and no will not be boy) is 1/2 by 1/2 and so on. Hence 1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2 or (1/2)^4  How many outcomes are possible for two boys or two girls, select among four children 4C2 or 6 ways  6*(1/4)^4=3/8  _________________ Success doesn't come overnight!           +1 Upvote Post      Quote       Flag                ArunangsuSahu  Master | Next Rank: 500 Posts       Follow User       View User Profile      Joined  31 Mar 2011    Posted:  382 messages    Upvotes:  15          Fri Dec 30, 2011 9:26 am            Sample Space = 2^4( as each one can be either a boy or a girl)=16  Exactly 2 boys and exactly 2 girls in 4C2*2C2 ways = Event = 6  Required Probability = 6/16 = 3/8            +1 Upvote Post      Quote       Flag            ankush123251  Senior | Next Rank: 100 Posts       Follow User       View User Profile      Joined  17 Feb 2011    Posted:  49 messages    Followed by:  2 members    Upvotes:  8          Mon Dec 19, 2011 11:26 pm            Each child has 2 options being a boy or a girl.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!  You'll also want to see: What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?             Gender Odds   What are the odds of having another boy or girl?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  Does having boys or girls run in the family?

There are 4 things that increase your chances of having a girl.
1. Have sex from the last day of your period (every day) to just 3 or 4 days before you are ovulating. You can do this with an ovulation kit. Studies have shown that girl sperm live much longer than boy sperm. Doing this will allow the girl sperm to stay alive long enough to fertilize the egg without having to compete with the boy sperm who will get there faster.
2. Eat foods that are very acidic. Girl sperm are not harmed by acidic levels and boy sperm usually die off and do better in alkali environments.
3. Use sexual positions that have shallow penetration, such as the missionary, that will leave the boy sperm furthest away from the egg as possible (because they are faster.)
4. It has also been suggested that it is better for the woman to NOT orgasm because it will make the environment more alkali.                 k.fordahl    Answered 1/17/09               52 found this helpful     You can&#39;t control the sex of your baby. It&#39;s impossible it all depends on the genetic makeup of the sperm.                 wood93    Answered 7/11/14               25 found this helpful     I&#39;d never heard much about acid/alkali, but we used the Shettles (sp?) method. Basically, you are fertile for four days. Use an ovulation test daily for a month so you can see how long you are fertile. The first day (or two) the strip starts to show fertility, you are more likely to get a girl (we did) and the later days when the strip is bold, solid, and dark, more likely to get a boy (we did). Another post said something like this too in a much more articulated way about the way the girls live longer etc... ;o)                 Jessie Johnson 6806    Answered 7/9/13               25 found this helpful     OH, and NO orgasm for the girl if you want a little princess...                 HarkerMommy    Answered 5/28/11               21 found this helpful     A report recently came out that women with high calorie diets, including eating breakfast(cereal), were more likely to conceive boys. And, that women with reduced calorie diets were then more likely to conceive girls. I am not really sure why this would be, since it is the sperm that determines the sex of the baby. Maybe the calories somehow change the womans reproductive tract environment, making it more or less favorable to an x or y sperm? With that being said, Victoria Beckham (who reportedly only eats 900 calories a day) has 3 sons.                 timmy mac mom    Answered 5/3/08               19 found this helpful     Ok my new partner has 2 teen sons and wants a girl so I looked in to all this. I&#39;m sorry to say that there is no sure way to up the chances of a girl and no provable scientific face. You can try most of the suggestions but please do some research before trying any as some can be harmful to your body and some can reduced your chances of getting pregnant. I love my partner and I know she wants a little girl more than anything but honestly please don&#39;t try anything that may harm your baby&#39;s development           a BabyCenter member   Answered 8/27/16               19 found this helpful     It depends on what kind of foods you are putting in your diet.. along with shallow penetration (have him release as far out as he can without pulling out completely), timing (do it everyday after your period up until 3-4 days before ovulation. Your boy days are during ovulation. The girls will last longer while the males die off) your diet also can make your environment more friendly toward male (eat lots of sodium/potassium rich foods-- potatoes etc.) or female (lots of calcium/magnesium rich foods-- whole grain cereal, green leafy veggies, yogurt, cranberry juice etc) You can also take supplements for calcium &amp; Magnesium to increase your chances. If you take the pH of your vagina before sex (be sure that it is around a pH of 4 for a girl) and also after sex just to be sure that it remains in that acidic pH level. (you can use certain douches, and replens to keep your environment acidic)

Any tips any advise to do so? Can i get some tips about having a baby of prefered sex. Thank you very much.                 saedahigginds    Answered 4/16/17               17 found this helpful     This might be a weird tip but my husband and I ran into an interesting woman on our anniversary in a restaurant. She sat down and started talking to us about my pregnancy and we were telling her how we were having a girl and how next time my husband would really like a boy.

 She told us a really sad story about how her husband left her after finding out she was pregnant with a girl and so she did a lot of research on how to conceive a boy in order to get him back. She told us low sodium and low red meat diets will increase your chances for a girl and that when we are trying for a boy to start eating tons of meat and a high sodium diet. Males are dependent on the girl gene. This might just be a old wives tale. But trying anything can help right!?

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

For the second, you need to be more clear.  Are you asking a practical question about the independence of gender statistics in families or an abstract question assuming that one child's gender is independent of all the others?  If the latter, then $\frac 12$. – lulu  May 26 '16 at 10:46            Are you assuming that each individual birth has a 50/50 chance of being male or female?   Or are you allowing for the fact that various sex selection factors act at conception, or between conception and birth, so that having 4 boys could indicate one of the partners has some factor tending to produce boys? – Colin McLarty  May 26 '16 at 10:49            No biological preference is assumed,50/50 chance for male/female – Hailey  May 26 '16 at 10:50        add a comment |           5 Answers 5     active  oldest  votes            up vote  13  down vote  accepted      Regarding the first question:   A and B are married. They have two kids. One of them is a girl. What
  is the probability that the other kid is also a girl?   This is a classical problem in probability. What makes this question confusing is the fact that the question is ambiguous since there may be no such thing as "the other kid".  Suppose a couple has two children, call then $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$. When you say "one of them is a girl" two possible interpretations are:  #1 Someone told me the couple has at least one girl but I don't know if both children are girls, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl, or if $\mathcal{Y}$ is a girl; the possible cases are GG, GB, BG. I want to compute the probability that both of the couple's children are girls (GG).  or  #2 Someone told me $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl but I don't know if $\mathcal{Y}$ is a boy or a girl; the possible cases are GG, GB. I want to compute the probability that $\mathcal{Y}$ is also a girl (GG).  Now, you can answer each of these questions using, for example, expressions for conditional probabilities (the answers to interpretations #1 and #2 are 1/3 and 1/2, respectively). However, if you are left with a feeling of "sure, I see how you can obtain that result but why isn't my answer correct?" read on.   Interpretation #1:  (This is the one I find interestingly confusing.)  When you first think about the problem you might use the following ( incorrect ) reasoning:   I know at least one of the children is a girl, what is the probability
  that the other child (the child of unknown gender) is also a girl? well,
  shouldn't it be 1/2? I mean, the other child can be a boy or a girl regardless ... right?   One of the problems with this reasoning is that there is no such thing as " the child of unknown gender " (therefore, there is no such thing as " the other child "). In fact, you do not know either of the children's genders (in this interpretation both children have unknown gender!). All you know is that there is a girl in there somewhere, but you do not know which of the two children is the girl. How can you hope to compute the probability that the other child (the child of unknown gender) is a girl if there is no such thing as "the child of unknown gender"? In fact, if you happen to know that $\mathcal{X}$ (or $\mathcal{Y}$) is a girl then you are using a different interpretation of the question (interpretation #2).  The other problem with this reasoning is related to independence. As people have pointed out, given the added overarching assumption that there is at least one girl, "$\mathcal{X}$'s gender" and "$\mathcal{Y}$'s gender" are not independent random variables. This is easy to see since, for example, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a boy then $\mathcal{Y}$ is forced to be a girl with probability 1 (not 1/2). This lack of independence is the reason why you can't say that one of the two children is a boy or girl independently/regardless of the other.  Formal Derivation of Answer to Interpretation #1:  Using the formula for conditional probabilities we have
\begin{align*}
P\big(\text{Both are Girls } \big| \text{ At Least One Girl}\big)&=\frac{P\Big(\big(\text{Both are Girls}\big)\cap\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)\Big)}{P\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)}\\
&=\frac{P\big(\text{Both are Girls}\big)}{P\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)}\\
&= \frac{1/4}{3/4}=\frac{1}{3}.
\end{align*}   Interpretation #2:  I don't think there is anything confusing about this interpretation. You know the $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl and $\mathcal{Y}$ can be a girl or a boy independently of $\mathcal{X}$. In this case, the random variables "$\mathcal{X}$'s gender" and "$\mathcal{Y}$'s gender" are not linked by any added overarching assumption and are independent.  Formal Derivation of Answer to Interpretation #2:  Using the independence of the second child's gender relative to the first child's gender:  \begin{align*}
P\big(\text{Second is a Girl } \big| {\text{ First is a Girl}}\big)=P\big(\text{Second is a Girl}\big)=\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}   Regarding the second question:   Now A and B have 4 children and all of them are boys. B is pregnant.
  So what is the probability that A and B are gifted with a baby girl?
  Is it 1/2 or there will be some conditional probability?   The answer is that the next child's gender is independent of the first four children's genders (by assumption), this is because there is no added overarching assumption involving the next child. The answer is then simply $1/2$. (This is just like in Interpretation #2.)     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Aug 10 '17 at 17:41             answered May 26 '16 at 19:48       Karla H.   503 1 10                  +1 Thanks for the lovely answer to an often asked question.

While I've known the mathematical answer to this problem and have been familiar with the ambiguity of the question for a while, I had always struggled to explain (without math) why the incorrect reasoning was incorrect. In my head the answer was often just "that's not how probability works". I'm glad to have come up with a semi-satisfying non-math-based explanation. – Karla H.  Jun 5 '16 at 18:50            i dont see how is this reliable? i know the answer is right but P(A/B) is calculated only if A and B are dependent, how the events of giving birth of two babies are affecting eachother conditionally ?if someone roll a dice and makes 6, the second toss would never depend on the first. – Abra001  Jun 5 '16 at 19:54             First: you can compute P(A|B) regardless of whether A and B are dependent or not.  Second: You are almost right, without other assumptions two babies can be assumed to have independent gender. However, in this case you are adding another assumption : you can't have two boys. Originally the babies genders are independent but once you start adding assumptions like "you can't have two boys" or "the second baby has to have different gender than the first baby" then the genders can become dependent random variables. – Karla H.

In this case, $A$ is the event that the other kid is a girl, and $B$ is the event that one of the kids is a girl.  $A\cap B$ would be both kids are girls, which has a probability of $\frac14$.  $B$ would be the event that one of the kids is a girl, which has a probability of $\frac34$.  Therefore, the required probability is $\frac{1/4}{3/4}=\frac13$.   And for the second question, we can do it using conditional probability or without.  Using conditional probability:  $A$ be the event that the fifth child is a girl.  $B$ be the event that the first four children are boys.  $P(A\cap B)$ would be $\left(\frac12\right)^5=\frac1{32}$.  $P(B)$ would be $\left(\frac12\right)^4=\frac1{16}$.  The required probability would be $\frac{1/32}{1/16}=\frac12$.  Without using conditional probability:  Notice that event $A$ is independent on event $B$.  Therefore, $P(A)=\frac12$.   Notes  In the first question, the probability in question is the probability that "the other kid is also a girl", making the two events dependent.  However, in the second question, the word other is gone, leaving us with independent events.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 26 '16 at 10:56             answered May 26 '16 at 10:45       Kenny Lau   13.9k 20 44                  and for the second question? – Hailey  May 26 '16 at 10:46        add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Originally there are $4$ equiprobable possibilities: BB,GB,GG,BG.

This is an example where we need to be extra careful using ordinary language to express what we mean mathematically.  Does it mean :   One specific kid is a girl ( for example first born ).  Any one of the two kids is a girl.  Exactly one of the kids is a girl (thanks to drhab's comment)   For 1 we only have the freedom left to consider two cases girl & boy which should be an equi-probable independent event. That is: probability $1/2$.  For 2 it is like sampling one of the letters $\{BB, BG, GB, GG\}$, noticing that it is a $G$ and then wondering what the other would be. As you can see there is only one G which has another G besides it but three which have any 1 G, so here the probability it would be $1/3$.  For 3 it could be if a parent says "I have two children of which one is a girl" it probably is assumed that only one of the kids is a girl and then the probability of second kid to be a girl would be 0.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 27 '16 at 11:41             answered May 26 '16 at 20:49       mathreadler   12.9k 7 17 54              1      There is even a third possibility: one of the kids is a girl could also mean exactly one of the kids is a girl .

[duplicate]         up vote  5  down vote  favorite  1       This question already has an answer here:    In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?  20 answers     My initial thought process: Sample space: GG, GB, BG, BB. I then crossed out BG because it's the same as GB because order doesn't matter here. And because we know one is a girl, there leaves two possibilities left. If the other is a boy, the probability should be 1/2, much like how they deduced it Finding probability of other child also being a boy .  However, I was told by my teacher that the answer is not 1/2 . I'm wondering if any of you guys can see a way in how the question is worded so that it's not 1/2...

The sample space is (and needs to be) $\{BB, BG, GB, GG\}.$  We know one child is a girl, so that rules out BB. That leaves us with a sample space of BG, GB, GG  In which case the probability that the second child is a boy is $\dfrac 23$.   Each of the four outcomes has a probability of $\frac 14$. BG: "Having a boy, and then a girl" is a different outcome than $GB:$ having a girl, and then a boy.  To omit one of the boy-girl/girl-boy pairs leaves a sample space of three, with each outcome having probability of 13, which is not correct. Having a boy-girl pair is twice as likely as having two boys, and twice as likely as having 2 girls, and we can only obtain this by counting all four outcomes as distinct, indeed, distinguishable.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 18 '13 at 15:55             answered Dec 14 '13 at 22:07       amWhy   187k 25 215 427                  I was thinking about that, but why?

If you knew that the older child was a girl, then the sample space would be simply $\{GG,GB\}$, where the older child is listed first, and the probability would indeed be $\frac12$. Similarly, if you knew that the younger child was a girl, the probability would be $\frac12$. If you knew that the taller child was a girl, it would be $\frac12$. But all you know here is that one of the children is a girl; if you list the possibilities in the order older-younger, you can rule out only $BB$. – Brian M.

If we assume that boys and girls are born with equal probability, then the probability to have two girls (and one boy) should be the same as the probability to have two boys and one girl. So you would have two cases with probability 2/3, giving an impossible 4/3 probability for both cases. – Thomas Padron-McCarthy  Jun 1 '16 at 6:48         10      Also, your list "Boy-Boy-Girl, Boy-Girl-Boy, and Girl-Boy-Boy" seems strange.

Strictly speaking, none of the answers are correct. If you make a few assumptions (some of which definitely aren't true for actual families) then you can get 3/8. The answer of 3/8 is an approximate solution, of the "assume a spherical cow" variety. – Glen_b  Jun 2 '16 at 2:26         add a comment |           8 Answers 8     active  oldest  votes            up vote  58  down vote      No, the possible outcomes are

wherein $3$ meet the requirement. There are $8$ possible outcomes, all equally likely (if we assume each gender is equally likely).  Hence the choice is $3/8$.  We can also think about it in at least one more way: 
You identified all the possible ways to get 2 boys and one girl. Since the events are disjoint, we can add up the probabilities
\begin{align*}
P(\text{2 boys, 1 girl}) &= P(\mathsf{BBG})+P(\mathsf{BGB})+P(\mathsf{GBB}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{3}{8}.

If order doesn't matter, GGB is the same as GBG. In both cases you have two girls and a boy.

BBB, BBG, BGG, and GGG could be used as the unordered results, but the middle two would need to be weighted 3x because there are 3 ways that each outcome is possible. – Dan Neely  Jun 2 '16 at 13:41        3      @Randy: Order doesn't matter, which is why the probability of all the combinations with the same frequency distribution of each sex are added together — i.e. all those with two boys and one girl — and then divided by the the total of all possible ones. – martineau  Jun 2 '16 at 13:45             Ok I get it.

You had three permutations. They would be BBB, BBG, BGB, BGG, GBB, GBG, GGB, and GGG. Out of those, the permutations with two boys and one girl are BBG, BGB, and GBB. The answer is the ratio of how many choices fit your conditions to the total number of possibilities, $\frac{3}{8}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 1 '16 at 2:32       asher drummond   494 1 15                  This answer could mislead someone who expects the word ‘permutations’ to have its usual meaning rather than a metaphorical extension. – Anton Sherwood  Jun 7 '16 at 18:48            Is this not the usual definition? – asher drummond  Jun 7 '16 at 21:42            The usual definition of ‘permutations’ is different sequences of the SAME set of distinguishable elements. – Anton Sherwood  Jun 8 '16 at 16:27        1      All of the above answers presume that there are only two genders.   However, in the twenty-first century there are numerous other genders and gender identifications.   To assert otherwise would be racist, politically incorrect, and a micro-agression that could, at UCLA, subject one to disciplinary action.  So, let p be the probability of a boy, q the probability of a girl, and r be the probability of one of those other genders, with p+q+r=1.  Assume that genders are independent of previous births.   Not enough space here, but you can lay out the 27 possible outcomes and their probabilities. – richard1941  Jun 8 '16 at 23:13         1      Is it not also discriminant to combine all non-binary genders into one? – asher drummond  Jun 9 '16 at 19:50        add a comment |             up vote  11  down vote      I drew it out this way:   So the answer is $\frac{3}{8}$.  Another way to think about it. After a first boy we need one of each (50%). After a first girl we must have only boys (25%). So the probability is $.5*\frac{1}{2} + .25*\frac{1}{2} = .375$ which is also equal to $\frac{3}{8}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 1 '16 at 16:14             answered Jun 1 '16 at 16:07       wally   211 1 7              add a comment |             up vote  10  down vote      Combinations vs Permutations  In case this is causing confusion, combinations don't depend on order. So if you had a lottery ticket, it matters whether you had the right combination of numbers. Or in this case, we are asking for the number of boys and girls, rather than the order that they appeared. The Permutations do consider order, so that would be more like a code for a safe that must be done in order, or the letters in a password, or in this case the sequence of genders where BGB would be a different sequence to GBB.  So a combination is like the list of stuff at the beginning of a recipe, and the permutation is the order that you add the ingredients. You can take the same list of things and add them in different amounts and different orders, and it will likely make a big difference to the result.  Working from combinations  Just to add that you can do it via combinations, as you originally thought, but you have to take into account the relative probabilities of those combinations, which derive from the set of permutations. As we have seen from the other answers, there are 3 permutations out of 8 which contain 2 boys and a girl.  But what if we looked at the combinations instead? The combinations of 2 genders among 3 children are:   3 girls  2 girls, 1 boy  1 girl, 2 boys  3 boys   Now for the frequencies   3 girls can only be arranged 1 way, so this is a frequency of 1  2 girls, 1 boy can be rearranged, and the boy can have 3 positions (youngest, middle or oldest). Once we have the position of the boy, the girls are known, so there are 3 positions  1 girl, 2 boys: same logic as above, frequency of 3  3 boys: as with 3 girls, frequency of 1   The total of them all is 8, and the number matching our requirement is 3, giving 3/8ths.  In this question, the easiest and clearest approach was to list out the permutations and count how many matched our requirement. For larger problems, it can be simpler to either quickly collect the easy cases and then look at the permutations for a restricted set, or focus on the possible combinations. This is particularly true when there are more complex options in the construction of the set.  Edit: More on Combinations and Permutations  @WoJ has a question: why does order matter? Suppose they were triplets?  I'm not saying that the chronological order of birth is what matters, only that you have to label them. We generally write permutations as a sequence which maps to an ordering of the variables; if I flip a coin 3 times and the result is HTH then I'm implicitly saying that the sequence represents the flips ordered chronologically. But we could flip 3 coins and order them by size, or by the age of the coin; it's just a way of identifying the different flips so that we can correctly account for the possibilities.  But! You must label them before you consider how they landed . Arranging heads first then tails is already turning the result from a permutation to a combination, and making things much harder by making the result dependent on the values, when they were independent variables at the beginning. So to assess the relationship between the original tosses and the resulting combinations we have to label them first or we'll give ourselves a headache.  We can see that it is the permutations that matter rather than the combinations for random independent coin flips by doing this experiment: flip 2 coins, and if they land the same (2H or 2T), then mark 1 in the 'Same' column. If they land differently (1H 1T) then mark 1 in the 'Diff' column. If the probability is determined by the combinations, then there is only 1 combination (1H 1T) that will give a 'Diff' result, vs 2 (2H and 2T) that give a 'Same' result, and after a few rounds of flips we should see twice as many marks in the 'Diff' column. Feel free to try the experiment; run it maybe 20 times so that it is clear whether the answer is more like 2:1 or like 1:1.  I predict that the result will be 1:1, because the probability is in the coin flip, so we have to look there for the statistical basis of our calculations. The probability is 50/50 of a single independent coin flip. So the first flip (or the flip of the biggest or oldest coin) is 50/50 H or T. Now, given that the first flip was a Head, what will the second be? These are independent coin flips, so the chances are still 50/50. This gives us a second value. Since these are independent flips, we label them differently and draw up either a table of their values, or a list of the permutations:  First
         H    T
2nd  H  0.25 0.25
     T  0.25 0.25  Now we can look at the categorisation of these permutations as combinations:  H       T
 H    2H     1H 1T
 T   1H 1T    2T  So although there are 3 labelled combinations (2H, 2T, 1H 1T), they are not evenly spread among the permutations (HH, TT, HT, TH), and we have already said that in this case the probability is being driven by the permutations, not the combinations. So to correctly account for the probabilities assigned to those combinations, we have to start from the permutations and see how they map to combinations; 2 go to becoming '1H 1T', and one each to '2H' and '2T'. How do they then map to the categories of 'Same' and 'Diff'?  H    T            1H 1T  Diff  = 0.25+0.25
 H   Same Diff   or    2H     Same  = 0.25
 T   Diff Same         2T     Same  = 0.25  And thus we have P(Same) = 0.25+0.25 = 0.5 and P(Diff) = 0.25+0.25 = 0.5.  At no point have we cared how we ordered the coins, only that we could identify them separately because they have independent probabilities assigned to their flips.  Are there cases where you can't get the answer by just looking at the permutations? Yes, absolutely. For example, the permutations are not always neatly equally likely as we have in these constructed problems. The possible colours of socks in my drawer might be Yellow, Green and Black, but I have a lot more Black socks because the world doesn't share my fascination with Green yet. If we looked at the permutations of 2 socks picked from the drawer, we would get YY, YG, YB, GY, GG, GB, BY, BG, BB. If we just naively looked at the permutations we might imagine the chance of getting a matched pair was 3/9, or 1/3. But it is not, because there are a lot more black socks.  We might instead have a lottery ticket, which only matters what the combination is; then looking at the permutations would be a fruitless exercise, as the drawing process enforces the relationship between probability and combination rather than permutation.  Triplets by combination  Do demonstrate the problems of arranging the triplet birth result into combinations before applying the probabilities, let's actually calculate it that way around. We flip 3 coins, and ignoring the chronology arrange them with heads first. The possible results are HHH, HHT, HTT, TTT. 4 combinations.  But how can we apply our probability that each birth is 50/50? By rearranging the order, we are breaking the mapping between an individual birth and the item in the combination; you can see that straight away in that the only way the first coin in our rearranged set can be a T is if all 3 coins came up T, and we know intuitively that that's much less likely than the probability for any given toss being T. Can we still do it? Well, yes, but it's tricky.  The first combination is HHH. What is the chance of throwing HHH? The flips are independent, and these coins can be rearranged however you like, but it will always have to be 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.125. So immediately the HHH combination has a chance of 0.125 instead of 0.25. Just because we have 4 categories, doesn't mean the probability relates to that number in any way.  The same argument applies for TTT. So now we have accounted for 0.25 of the probability out of half the combinations.  What of HHT and HTT? Well, since the chances of H and T are equal, we could relabel H as T and T as H, or call the sides A and B without any loss of generality, so the probabilities must be equal here too; both combinations are 2 of one and 1 of the other. So the remaining 6/8 of the probability give us 3/8 for each option.  What if H and T were not interchangeable? Suppose P(H) was 3/5, not 1/2? We can see that the combinations don't give us a straight answer because they are unchanged (3H, 2H, 1H, 0H) but we know intuitively that the chances of getting 2H must depend on the bias of the coin flip. Here we would have a remaining probability of 1 - 0.4*0.4*0.4 - 0.6*0.6*0.6 = 0.72. The two remaining combinations are HTT and HHT. So we know that the first and last of those coins came out the same, and this is the set of tosses which contain one head and one tail. Removing that head and tail leaves the outcome of a single coin. It doesn't matter which order the coins were tossed in, or even how we reordered them afterwards. The final coin has P(H)=0.6 and P(T)=0.4, so P(H)/P(T) = 1.5. We already have the other two coins, so we have P(2H 1T)/P(1H 2T) = 1.5. Distributing the remaining probability of 0.72 gives us P(2H 1T)+P(1H 2T)=0.72, and we can then substitute to get P(2H 1T)+P(2H 1T)/1.5=0.72, so P(2H 1T)=0.432.  By contrast, to calculate that from the original tosses, we have:  P(2H,1T) = P(HHT)+P(HTH)+P(THH) 
         = .6*.6*.4 + .6*.4*.6 + .4*.6*.6
         = 0.144 * 3 = 0.432  So if we have independent variables (births, coin tosses), it is easiest to look at the permutations and collect the probabilities of the permutations we want than to start from the combinations and work backwards to figure out how their probabilities relate to the individual variable probabilities. But it is not impossible, and in some cases preferable.  TLDR: The important thing is to look at the mechanism by which randomness appears in the system, and to then measure the probabilities from there either in terms of combinations or permutations, but not blindly applying either as the method entirely depends on the mechanism of the randomness. Both approaches can be made to work, but only if you correctly account for the probabilities according to the system you are considering.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 3 '16 at 13:20             answered Jun 1 '16 at 10:05       Phil H   883 1 5 12                  I have a hard time understanding why the order needs to be taken into account at all. Let's imagine they were triplets which were born at the same time. The outcome of this pregnancy can be one of the four you listed.

Basically, it's not about chronology but about labelling so that we can apply the probability we know about (that each birth is 50/50 boy or girl). By arranging the results into combinations, you have already skipped the step of relating the individual birth probabilities to permutation probabilities, and thus are not accounting for the given probabilities correctly. If that isn't clear, let me know. – Phil H  Jun 3 '16 at 11:39            I like the idea of having him do a simulation by coin flipping!   A couple hundred trials should be enough to distinguish between 3/8 and 1/3. I wonder if this would be permitted on the exam...  It is almost like cheating.  But I remember a theorem in probability to the effect that anything can be simulated by a sequence of Bernoulli trials. – richard1941  Jun 8 '16 at 23:25         add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      A systematic way to calculate @probablyme s answer to encode the letters B (boy) and G (girl) as a 3 digit binary number with the logical value 1 for true and 0 for false ( that the digit represents a boy ).  Then we loop through all combinations, for example by incrementing by 1  each step.$$000\to001\to010\to011\to100\to 101\to110\to111$$  We then count the total number of "ones" equals 2. This is the same as the "population count" function used in this question and answer .  The output of the function would be:
$$0\to1\to1\to2\to1\to2\to2\to3$$  And as we can see, for 3 of the 8 states the function evaluates to 2. This means that after counting all possibilities, we found that 3 of the 8 equiprobable states correspond to two boys. This gives a probability of $\frac{3}{8}$.   The strength of this approach is of course that if we modify the question to account for more advanced things, these can be included with fast logical bit-wise operations on the numbers!     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:21       Community ♦   1        answered Jun 1 '16 at 16:28       mathreadler   12.9k 7 17 54              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Since the question does not mention the order, the possible combinations are   3 Boys  2 Boys and 1 Girl (3 ways to do it)  1 Boy and 2 Girls (3 ways to do it)  3 Girls   That means the correct answer is 37,5% or 3/8     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 1 '16 at 11:44             answered Jun 1 '16 at 11:37       GodlyHedgehog   1 2                  Did you really compute 37½% before rationalizing it to 3/8? – Anton Sherwood  Jun 7 '16 at 18:50             In my high school some teachers asked to write probability-related values with percentage. – GodlyHedgehog  Jun 21 '16 at 9:58        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      because 'not a boy' is same as a girl (opposite), it could be calculated like this.  $ \binom{3}{2}  (\frac{1}{2})^2(\frac{1}{2})^{2-1} = 0.375 $   $ \binom{n}{k}  (p)^k(1-p)^{n-k} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 2 '16 at 10:36       P_95   1 1              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The following method avoids any need to consider the number of permutations with 2 boys and 1 girl.  3 children must include either at least 2 boys or at least 2 girls (but not both).

The probability that at least one of two children is a boy born in spring is therefore $1 - (1 - \frac 18)^2$ = $\frac{15}{64}$.  The probability that both children are boys born in spring is $(\frac 18)^2 = \frac{1}{64}$. The probability that one child is a boy born in spring and the other is a boy born in one of the other three seasons is $\frac{15-1}{64}$ x $ \frac37$ = $\frac{6}{64}$ (multiplying by $\frac37$ rather than $\frac48$ because $\frac{15-1}{64}$ excludes the case in which the other child is also a boy born in spring). This makes a total joint probability of two boys and at least one boy born in spring of $\frac{7}{64}$.

Judging from the probabilities 0.25 of both boys and 0.75 of at least 1 boy, I can surely say that P(boy) = 0.5 and P(girl)=0.5 .  I presume that you are asking how is the probability of both boys given that at least 1 boy is born in spring = $\frac{7}{15}$  Now, since the word "spring" is somehow introduced, lets assume that it is possible for a child to be born in any of the 4 seasons with equal probability.  Lets now have a look at the sample space:  A = All events in Set(Both Boys | One is born in Spring) = 2*(Boys in Autumn, Winter, Summer) + (Both boys in Spring)  B = All events in Set (One Boy born in Spring) = 2*(Boys in Autumn, Winter, Summer) + (Both boys in Spring) + 2*(Girl in Autumn, Winter, Summer, Spring)  Hence, Probability of (Both Boys|One boy is born in spring) = $\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}$  We assume no chance of twins.  Hope that solves the question.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 18 '12 at 21:44             answered Sep 18 '12 at 21:28       rrampage   327 2 9              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      A simple way is to keep track of the older child.

Suppose there is a birthday party to which all of the girls (and none of the boys) in a small town are invited. If you run into a mother who has dropped off a kid at this birthday party and who has two children, the chance that she has two girls is $1/3$. Why? $3/4$ of the mothers with two children will have a daughter at the birthday party, the ones with two girls ($1/4$ of the total mothers with two children) and the ones with one girl and one boy ($1/2$ of the total mothers with two children). Out of these $3/4$ of the mothers, $1/3$ have two girls.  On the other hand, if the birthday party is only for fifth-grade girls, you get a different answer. Assuming there are no siblings who are both in the fifth grade, the answer in this case is $1/2$. The child in fifth grade is a girl, but the other child has probability $1/2$ of being a girl. Situations of this kind arise in real life much more commonly than situations of the other kind, so the answer of $1/3$ is quite nonintuitive.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '10 at 1:54             answered Dec 23 '10 at 1:05       Peter Shor   2,466 14 22              add a comment |             up vote  60  down vote      In a family with 2 children there are four possibilities:  1) the first child is a boy and the second child is a boy (bb)  2) the first child is a boy and the second child is a girl (bg)  3) the first child is a girl and the second child is a boy (gb)  4) the first child is a girl and the second child is a girl (gg)  Since we are given that at least one child is a girl there are three possibilities: bg, gb, or gg.

Of course this is not unique to English, and I think you should be able to find similar similar puzzles in pretty much any natural language.  Here is an example that brings out the difficulty more clearly.  First, consider the following similar puzzle:   A family has two children, Robin and Lindsay. Lindsay is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   In elementary probability class, they teach you to answer this by making a table of the four options  Robin    Lindsay
  B        B
* B        G
  G        B
* G        G  The starred rows are the ones where Lindsay is a girl, and we compute from them that the chance that both children are girls is 1/2.  Now consider this puzzle   A family has two children, Robin and Lindsay. At least one of them is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   The elementary probability method gives the following table, and a probability of 1/3.  The difference is that we gain one more row, compared to the previous puzzle.  Robin    Lindsay
  B        B
* B        G
* G        B
* G        G  After looking at these, you can see that the difficulty of the original puzzle comes because, in English, "one of the children" can mean several different things:   "one" can mean "a particular one". If you read the original puzzle like this, it becomes analogous to the first puzzle I wrote, and the answer will be 1/2.  "one" can mean "at least one". If you read the original puzzle like this, it become analogous to the second puzzle I wrote, and the answer is 1/3.  "one" can mean "exactly one". If you read the original puzzle like this, the answer is 0.   There is a common convention in mathematics that "one" usually means "at least one". For example, this is the sense intended in the following sentence, which is a typical example of mathematical English: "if a natural number $n$ is a multiple of a prime number $p$, and $n = ab$, then one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by $p$."  We would not read this as saying that exactly one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by $p$.  I don't believe this convention is very common in non-mathematical English. If I say, "one of my children is a girl", in normal English this means that the other is a boy. Similar discrepancies between mathematical and non-mathematical English come up with our use of the word "or" and our use of the phrase "if/then".  When we teach mathematics, we have to spend time explaining this mathematical argot to students, so they can use the same English conventions that we do.  Probability puzzles like the one you're asking about rely on these differences of English meaning, rather than on any logical or mathematical problem.  In that sense, they aren't really puzzles, they're just tricks.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 23 '10 at 15:47       Carl Mummert   61.2k 7 116 227                  I now, at last, agree that the correct answer is 1/3.

It's long, but bear with me - after reading this answer, you should feel intuitively-comfortable with almost all other probabilistic fallacies, not just this one.  The first and most important thing is to define what we mean by "probability."  Let's define it to mean "the expected percentage of positive outcomes when repeating an observation over a large sample"  (Go ahead, read that again, more slowly) .  Also, let's call the method we use to chose this large sample the "model."  This may sound trivial, but it has some important implications.  For example, what is the probability you will die before age 40?  According to our definition, this question has no meaning:  we can't observe you multiple times before age forty and record how many times you die.  Instead, we observe other people below age 40, and record how many of them die.  So let's say we observe all other people on earth below age 40 (our model), and find that 1/2 of them die before hitting the big four-oh.  Does this mean the probability of you dying before 40 is 50%?  Well, according to this model, it does!  However, this is hardly a fair model.  Perhaps you live in a first-world country - now when we revise our model to include only people below 40 in first-world countries, your chances become a much-less-grim 1/10 † .  But you are also not a smoker, and don't live in the city, and ride your bike on Sundays with your wife and crazy mother-in-law, which makes your chances 123/4567!  That's much better... however, our model still doesn't take into account that you are also an avid skydiver ;)  † I am pulling these numbers out of nowhere, they are not real statistics.  So the point is, asking for a "probability" only makes sense in the context of a certain model - a way of repeating our observation many times.  Without that, asking for a probability is meaningless.   Now, back to the original question.  Before we can assign a probability, we must choose a model; how are we choosing the families to sample from?  I see two obvious choices, which will lead to different answers:   Consider only families which have two children, one of whom is a girl, and choose one randomly.  Consider only girls who have exactly one sibling, and choose one randomly.   Do you see the difference?  In the first case, every family has the same probability of being chosen.  However, in the second case, the families with two girls are more likely to be chosen than families with only one girl, because every girl has an equal chance of being chosen:  the two-girl families have doubled their odds by having two girls.  If children were raffle tickets, they would have bought two tickets while the one-girl families bought only one.  Thus, we should expect the probabilities in these two cases to be different.  Let's calculate them more rigorously (writing BG to mean "boy was born, then girl):   There are three equally probable family-types: BG , GB , and GG  ( BB was removed from consideration, because they have no girls) .  Since only one of the three has two girls, our chances of having two girls are 1/3 .  We have the same possibilities as above, but now GG is twice as likely as BG or GB .  Thus, the probabilities are GG: 2/4 , GB: 1/4 , and BG: 1/4 , meaning the probability of a girl-sibling is 2/4 = 1/2  (alternatively, we could have noted that there are only two equally-probable possibilities for the sibling:  boy or girl) .   Here lies the fallacy:  the model our intuition assumes is the second one, but the way the problem is worded strongly implies the first one.  When we think in terms of "randomly choosing a family (over a large number of families)," our intuition meshes perfectly with the result.   Let's take a look at another similar problem   In a family of two children, where the oldest child is a girl, what is the probability they are both girls?   Once again, I can see two different, plausible models for observing our random sample:   Consider only families with two children, the oldest of whom is a girl, and choose one randomly.  Consider only girls who have exactly one (younger) sibling, and choose one at random.   So once again, the question strongly implies the first model, though arguments for either could be made.  However, when we actually calculate the probability...   Same as before, but we've also eliminated BG , where the first child was a boy.  This leaves only two equally-probable possibilities, GB and GG .  Thus, the chances are 1/2 .  We've also eliminated BG from this case, leaving GB and GG .  However, unlike the original question, GG is no longer twice as likely, since the younger child can no longer be the one who was randomly chosen.  Thus, GB and GG are equally likely, and we again have a probability of 1/2  (alternatively, we could have noted that there are only two equally-probable possibilities for the sibling:  boy or girl) .   ...we find that the choice between these two models doesn't matter, because in this case both have the same probability!  Among two-child families with an older daughter, it doesn't matter if we randomly choose the family or the older-daughter, because in both cases there is only one of each per family.   Hopefully that all made sense.  For bonus points, try applying this reasoning to the Monty Hall problem.  What is our model - how are we making repeated observations?  Why does it clash with our intuition?  For even more bonus points, try to figure out the following question; the math isn't too difficult, but it took me a long while to figure out why, intuitively, the answer should be correct:   In a family of two children, one of whom is a girl named Florida, what are the chances of two girls?   (If you have troubles, post a question and leave a link to it in the comments, and I'll try to answer it there as best I can :) )     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 31 '14 at 16:57             answered Dec 21 '10 at 18:36       BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft   5,225 3 26 42              4      I don't completely agree with this analysis. Mathematically, there is no problem at all. Once we list the possible events and the favorable events, the probability is just the corresponding fraction. So the difficulty in these puzzles is just that English hasn't evolved a clear way to describe a probability space. There are two reasonable probability spaces here, and usual English is not clear about which of them is intended. But regardless what anyone knows about the children, I can still compute the probabilities in both these spaces, to get 1/3 and 1/2, respectively. – Carl Mummert  Dec 23 '10 at 15:06             @Carl: Then you must believe that the Monty Hall problem is ambiguous in exactly the same way, no?  I'm afraid I have to disagree with that. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Dec 23 '10 at 17:15         2      I do feel that the difficulty in the Monty Hall problem is also not "mathematical", in the sense that as soon as any probability model has been rigorously stated then the probabilities can be calculated using basic methods. The arguments about the Monty Hall problem stem from a lack of rigour in the statement, which I think is often intentional in order to make an otherwise easy probability exercise into a "puzzle". – Carl Mummert  Dec 23 '10 at 17:44            @Carl: In both cases, it's not that it's ambiguous or not mathematically-defined, it's just counter-intuitive. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Dec 23 '10 at 21:29        2      The two puzzles are similar, and you've made a nice comparison.  They each have two simple probability models, and it's clear which gives the clever, counter-intuitive solution.  But if you admit any more complexity, there's a lot of ambiguity in both problems.  For example, given a room full of people convinced that switching doors is the right strategy, an adversarial Monty Hall can make sure no one wins by offering the switch only to those who first choose the car.  In real life, I would assume ratings and TV gimmicks affect what choices I'm given, and I have no probability model for that! – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 23 '10 at 23:04        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  10  down vote      Here's some idea.  Suppose you sample $4n$ families with two children, where $n$ is a very large integer. Then, with a very high probability, about $n$ of them have two boys, about $n$ have two girls, and about $2n$ have one girl and one boy.
Since you ignore the families with two boys, the desired probability is given by $n/(3n) = 1/3$.  EDIT: The above solution corresponds to the following situation. You visit a large number of families. In each family, you check if there are two kids. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you check if one of the kids is a girl. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you check if both kids are girls.  EDIT: Among all the OP's examples, only one is relevant here. Namely, "I visit this family. I know they have 2 kids. One of them, a girl, comes into the room. The probability that the 2nd kid is also a girl is 1/2, no?". Well, in this situation the probability is indeed $1/2$, assuming the following interpretation. You visit a large number of families. In each family, you check if there are two kids. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you wait until one of the kids comes into the room. If it is a boy, you ignore this family; otherwise you check if both kids are girls. It is readily understood that this leads to a probability of $1/2$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 21 '10 at 13:52             answered Dec 21 '10 at 12:47       Shai Covo   20.7k 1 27 52              4      Of course, a lot depends on how we interpret the question. – Shai Covo  Dec 21 '10 at 12:52        1      @NotSuper: It all depends a lot on the precise formulation, as Shai already pointed out. Let's say you visit a friend who flips a coin twice.

So you know more than in the experiment I formulated. In that experiment, I assumed that you know that at least one of the two outcomes is Heads, but if it's only one head, then you don't know which coin it is! In your experiment you know that that coin lying closer to you is a head, so it's a different experiment. – Hendrik Vogt  Dec 21 '10 at 15:38         1      @NotSuper: I understand that this is a bit difficult. Let me put my experiment in different words: When I write "Given that at least one of the outcomes is Heads", then this means: someone looked at both coins and provided you with the information that one of the outcomes is Heads. In your experiment, you look only at one of the coins. – Hendrik Vogt  Dec 21 '10 at 17:46        1      @NotSuper: No. Looking at only one coin and looking a two coins gives different knowledge.

(The original question is a little ambiguous, but I agree that 1/3 is the best answer.)  The marble example and the example of the firstborn daughter are the same situation-- the second trial is independent, and the odds are 1/2.  In these cases you know the first trial is independent, and you can ignore it.  The original question intends you to imagine a randomly chosen 2 child family from among all families with at least 1 daughter.  For example, suppose there is a social science study on 2 child families with at least 1 daughter-- in this situation, about 1/3 of the families will be daughter-daughter, 1/3 will be daughter-son, and 1/3 will be son-daughter.  You have to consider the full probability space of two trials (d-d,d-s,s-d,s-s) and eliminate the s-s possibility.  This leaves a 1/3 chance of 2 daughters.  For other variations on this question, you have to decide the appropriate probability space before answering.  (One common, confusing variation is to suppose the family has two children, one of which is a son born on a Tuesday-- what are the odds of two sons?)  In your example where the first child in the room is a daughter, if we suppose that the order the children enter has nothing to do with sex, then the probability the other child is a daughter is 1/2.  However, maybe the family encourages their daughters to play inside and their sons outside-- then you could assume the other child is a son, since he hasn't come in yet.  Maybe the culture has a tradition that the oldest daughter in the household (if there is a daughter) offers guests drinks-- then you know the family has at least one daughter, and the odds that they have another daughter is 1/3.  Once you've chosen your assumptions, you can define the probability space and compute the answer.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 21 '10 at 14:03       Jonas Kibelbek   5,049 1 21 28              1      @Jonas  It isn't at all clear that "The original question intends you to imagine a randomly chosen 2 child family from among all families with at least 1 daughter." Instead I imagined I hadn't seen my nephew in a decade, and we hadn't kept in touch. But I had heard that he had 2 kids and one was a girl. I was going to visit him soon and was wondering about the other child. Girl? or boy? I figured the chances of a girl was 1 in 2, and I still do. I found the Wikipedia article linked to by Rawling enlightening. – NotSuper  Dec 21 '10 at 15:15             @NotSuper: Yes, I agree it's ambiguous.  It is clear that I gave Mlodinow's intended interpretation only because he gave the answer 1/3.  But your nephew scenario is ambiguous as well-- how did you hear that one child is a girl?  You could learn that among their children is at least one daughter (maybe they send an old dollhouse to your grandchildren), which gives 1/3.  Or, you could specify one of their children (oldest, first to answer the phone, etc., as long as it's independent of sex) and learn she is a girl, which gives 1/2. – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 21 '10 at 15:42            These correspond to the two probability spaces described in my answer and in the Wikipedia article.  When you hear that one child is a girl, can you cross off son-son and son-daughter, or can you just cross off son-son?  (With other information and messier probability models, we could get other answers than 1/2 and 1/3 as well.  But these are the two most sensible models to apply.) – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 21 '10 at 15:46             @Jonas "How did you hear that one child is a girl?" I wrote "I had heard that he had 2 kids and one was a girl." I think that implies that someone told me that (or possibly wrote that to me in a letter or email), and that's all I know about my nephew's children. Isn't that the standard interpretation? – NotSuper  Dec 24 '10 at 13:34             @NotSuper: To quote from Carl's answer, "one child" can be interpreted several ways in English: "one particular child," "at least one child," or "exactly one child."  If the letter or e-mail gives you enough context to pick one interpretation, then it's easy to compute the probability.  Your intuitive answer of 1/2 is a correct answer, provided you recognize you are using the "one particular child" interpretation.  But, since this is a puzzle or riddle, the smallest assumption ("at least one child"), which gives the counter-intuitive answer, is the riddler's preferred answer.

Consider the following two procedures:  Procedure A: I flip two coins, a nickel and a penny.  After the flip, I
pick one at random, and report its value to you.  Procedure B: I flip two coins, a nickel and a penny.  If exactly one lands
heads, I report that one's value to you, i.e. I say either "the nickel
landed heads" or "the penny landed heads" as appropriate.  If both land
heads, I report on one of them chosen at random.  If neither lands
heads, I say "both landed tails."  Now, if I follow Procedure A and say "the nickel landed
heads", then the probability that the penny landed heads is 50/50.  But
if I say the very same thing after following Procedure B, the
probability that the penny landed heads is 1 in 3.  Now take the following problem:  I flip two coins and say to you "the
nickel landed heads".  What is the probability that the penny landed
heads? Clearly there's no way to answer without knowing or assuming something about the procedure I'm following.  (All this having been said, I agree that the best answer to the original question is 1/3.)     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 22 '10 at 22:47       Larry Denenberg   656 3 10              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?  0%.

In this case we are given that one or both of the children is a girl, but not given any information about which one(s) -- so a simple evaluation of the 4 possible scenarios (for a two-child family) reveals the answer of 33%.  The confusion stems from the slightly ambiguous language used.  The phrase one of the children was used to mean one or both of the children .

$$  (note that I am assuming this isn't taken as a "trick" question, so that $P(X|GG) = 1$ is meant, rather than $P(X|GG)=0$)  So everything boils down to the probability of "one of the children is a girl" given that the family has a boy and a girl.  Now, what does the phrase "one of the children is a girl" mean? There are two typical options   This phrase simply means that this is not an all-boy family. In this case, $P(X|BG) = 1$, and $P(GG|X) = 1/3$.  The phrase means that a particular child was chosen and it could just has easily have been the boy, so that $P(X|BG) = 1/2$, and $P(GG|X) = 1/2$.   In my opinion, an English speaker would almost always interpret the phrase the first way rather than the second way.  However, there is a nasty linguistic trap: even meaning it the first way, we may often pick a girl to be the referent of "one" (e.g. so that we can speak of the "other" child). And since we've picked a girl, we get stuck in the second interpretation. This is exacerbated by the fact the second interpretation has a very appealing shortcut for reasoning out the solution.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 17 '15 at 3:51             answered Oct 17 '15 at 3:37       Hurkyl   102k 8 100 237              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      You have to read carefully.

girl".  Two of them lead to the 1/2 and 1/3 answers which have been discussed
at length, but I found only one brief
answer covering the third
interpretation (though I did only skim).  The meaning of the statement, and consequently the correct answer, can be
altered by considering it to answer different questions.   "How many of your children are girls?"  "One of my children is a girl."  "Is one of your children a girl?"  "Yes, one of my children is a girl."  "Is the child in the stroller a boy or a girl?"  "This one is a girl."   Suppose you've just had the first discussion; what do you think the other child
will be in that case?  There is no chance the other is a girl.  The second question would prompt most people to search their set of children
for a girl and answer "yes" if they can find one or "no" otherwise.
Consequently, out of the 3/4 of two-child parents who can answer yes, about 1/3
of those will have another girl.  However it's conceivable that some kind of contrarian may resolve "one of your
children" even before they have considered the rest of the question, choosing
one at random regardless of its gender, and answering the rest of the question
with respect to that random choice.  This renders the situation equivalent to
the third case.  In the third case, obviously, the gender of the other child is independent of
all the information we have.  So it's a 1/2 chance.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:20       Community ♦   1        answered Feb 22 '17 at 18:54       sh1   117 2                  This is entirely incorrect.

I set $q=P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \mbox{He has $\{B,G\}$})$.  If you sample at family level, then you ask the father if he has at least a daughter or you check official records. In that case $q=1$.  If you sample at child level, by for instance meeting the father in the company of one child or otherwise happening to find out about one child, then $q=1/2$. In this case you will half the time miss this family because you happen to see the son first.  Using Bayes' formula, we get
$$
P(\{B,G\}) \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})
= \frac{P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{B,G\}) P(\{B,G\})}
{P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})}.
$$  Since
$$P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter}) = P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{B,G\}) P(\{B,G\}) + P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{G, G\}) P(\{G, G\}),
$$  we get 
$$
P(\{B,G\} \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter}) = (q \times 1/2)/(q \times 1/2 + 1 \times 1/4) = 2q/(1 + 2q),
$$  and it follows that 
$$
P(\{G, G\} \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})=1/(1 + 2q).
$$  If $q=1/2$, we get $P=1/2$, and $q=1$ gives $P=1/3$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 2 '17 at 18:23       Helmer.Aslaksen   21 2              add a comment |             up vote  -2  down vote      Ok let us consider the unknown. A couple has a girl child. The wife gets pregnant. What are the odds the second child will be a (girl) or (boy).  Now we have reduced the question to a single possibility set.
 the child will have x-x chromosomes
 The child will have x-y Chromosomes  The wife ONLY provides X chromosomes. The husband has the coin toss x or y.
As there is ONLY one coin being thrown (the second x or y in our fair coin toss) then the odds remain 50%. We are NOT Throwing two fair coins to find an answer in this case.  Given a fair coin, the odds are 50% of either outcome, period. We can now use this theory regardless of anything else when asking about the next occurrence (or unknown previous occurrence) as it is separate from any other occurrence and not related in any way. There are TWO options only.  You can stack all the "possibilities and probabilities" you want to, however we KNOW that given a coin toss the next toss has a 50% chance of either outcome. IT is ONLY in looking backward at "n" tosses and in the ORDER of results that any other probability exists and that does not apply to the next toss itself. Having tossed three Y's consecutively does not increase the odds of an X on the next toss, nor reduce it.  Where the first toss is unknown (the second child is a girl) then it still makes no difference...there is an xx, xy possibility genetically as to the first toss. Therefore 50% chance. Ignore english completely...look at the basic problem, unless you care about order or statistics of results over "n" tosses etc.  The ONLY way that one ever has a statistic of 
gg
gb
bg
bb  is when a fair coin is tossed n times and actually create the "expected" result given above. It is not possible to change the odds of "next throw" of a fair coin(s). Only to look backward to the odds that a specific result might be expected over n tosses in a specific order or not. We only have ONE toss involved (next or unknown previous toss) then there is only one possible answer, a 50% chance an x or y chromosome exists.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 26 '16 at 22:55       Djea3   1              add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      It's 1/2 as order is not important, just the physical combination.  i.e. BG == GB.

I dont see any ambiguity with this question. Clearly, the OP, didnt specify the position of the first girl. Even if the OP, asked "...if the Eldest is a girl, that both children are girls?" and we have to include the 'order' of the genders in determining the probability of the 2nd child the answer is still 1/2.  General basis...that there's a 50% chance that the 2nd child is either a boy or a girl(gender is an independent event). Therefore, (ignoring reality that the ratio of boys and girls is skewed in favor of girls) its distribution within a population (multiple events) is equally, half boys and half girls, for the second child.  Proof of this is by looking at genetics. Males, carries the xy chromosomes and xx for the females.  A child can be either xx or xy.  In a family of 2 children then the distribution of chromosomes would be the following combination...  xx xx (all girls) xy xy (all boys) xx xy (a girl and a boy)  *note the 3rd combination, it's not order specific, which also represent the combination xy xx  It's given that one child is a girl therefore we can remove the combination xy xy. We end up with only 2 combination, one of the combination is xx xx (all girls) therefore the chance of that happening is 1/2.  If we have to be specific with the gender order then our combination would be...  xx xx xy xy xx xy xy xx  and "...if the Eldest is a girl..."  a) one child is a girl therefore we can remove the xy xy combination  b) eldest is a girl therefore we can remove the xy xx combination (boy is older)  which leaves us with the following combination....  xx xy xx xx  clearly 1/2  Why 1/3 is wrong...  The original assumption is that there are 4 combinations as oppose to 3. The 4 combinations only applies if the order is specified either the eldest or the youngest.  If the known girl is the eldest then the combination BG has to be excluded for consideration.  If the known girl is the youngest then the combination GB has to be excluded for consideration.  The 1/3 proponent assume that there is no order and represented the boy and girl combination both ways instead of one. Or, there is order but neglected to remove the combination that doesnt represent the actual position of the known girl.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 21 '13 at 8:30             answered Dec 21 '13 at 8:22       nick   1 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

So don't wait until you ovulate. Use our handy dandy ovulation calculator to help you plan to do the deed two or more days before ovulation. Or you could try The Whelan Method , named after Elizabeth Whelan, author of Boy or Girl, which is basically the opposite approach. The Shettles Method boasts a slightly higher success rate of 75 percent at conceiving the child of choice.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

However, if you're not great at dealing with probabilities yet, the numbers involved in this question are so small that you could 'map-out' all of the possibilities. In that way, "brute force" can get you the correct answer rather quickly. Since the probability of having a girl is identical to the probability of having a boy, we don't have to do anything special with the math. The possible outcomes for having 3 children are: B=Boy, G=Girl BBB BBG BGB GBB GGG GGB GBG BGG The question asks for the probability of having 3 children that are ALL the SAME gender (meaning all boys or all girls): Total possibilities = 8 Total with 3 boys or 3 girls = 2 2/8 = 1/4 Final Answer: [Reveal] Spoiler: E GMAT assassins aren't born, they're made, Rich _________________   760+: Learn What GMAT Assassins Do to Score at the Highest Levels Contact Rich at: Rich.C@empowergmat.com       Rich Cohen  Co-Founder & GMAT Assassin   Follow          Special Offer: Save $75 + GMAT Club Tests Free Official GMAT Exam Packs + 70 Pt.

In the family there is already one girl. Then the probability of a second girl is 1/2. Why does it matter whether the girl is the first or the second in the family?. I know that I am wrong but I don´t understand why. _________________  Encourage cooperation!

If it was so, then the probability would indeed be \(\frac{1}{2}\). But here we need to consider following two cases: 1) The first child is a girl In this case there are two possibilities - \(GB, GG\). 1) The first child is a boy In this case there is just one possibility - \(BG\). Notice that \(BB\) is not possible as the question explicitly states that one girl is a child. Hence the probability is \(\frac{1}{3}\). _________________   The buttons on the left are the buttons you are looking for                          eltonj      Intern           Joined: 17 Mar 2015   Posts: 10                      Re: A couple has two children, one of whom is a girl.

First child ---- Second child: B ---------------------------- B; B ---------------------------- G; G ---------------------------- B; G ---------------------------- G. We know that one if the kids is a girl. So, we have one of the three cases in red. Each case there is equally likely (each has the probability of 1/2*1/2=1/4). So, the probability of GG is 1/3.

Hello HKD1710 Please go Through eshan429 's post probability-217147.html#p1406381 IMHO, I don't feel you need to consider younger /older in this case. The chances of having a twins ( Boy and Girl) in a single delivery can not be rejected. Both Boy and Girl may be born at the same time, we need to consider only the probability of having only 2 daughters ( They may be twins as well - Born on the same day) Younger / Elder daughter is not important in this case , we simply restrict ourself to a female child (daughter) Happy Preparations Abhishek  _________________   Thanks and Regards Abhishek....

Now there are 4!/2!*2! ways of having exactly 2 boys and 2 girls... which is 6. So total probability of that event happening is 6*1/16 = 3/8 = A The answer would not change for 2 boys and 1 girl Which will be 3*1/8 = 3/8 _________________  You've been walking the ocean's edge, holding up your robes to keep them dry.

Choosing 2 boys out of 4 leaves 2 girls, hence no additional selection of girls is required. Finally, probability of choosing exactly 2 boys and 2 girls is 1/16 * 6 = 3/8.

You can easily verify this by using the same methodology. There are _ _ _ --> 3 possible spots, 1 for every child. Each of these spots has only 2 possible outcomes occurring with equal likelihood (1/2). This leaves us with a probability of (1/2)^3 =1/8 for every single possible outcome. The next thing to ask yourself is how many of all possible cases include 2 boys (B) and 1 girl (G). The answer is 3 and turns out to be very intuitive if you start to write down a few possible outcomes. GBB BGB BBG All other scenarios will either include 2 girls and 1 boy, 3 boys or 3 girls. Final step is to multiply the probability of each individual outcome with the number of outcomes that satisfy the condition we are looking for. --> 3x(1/8)=3/8                          Temurkhon      Director        G     Joined: 23 Jan 2013   Posts: 592   Schools:  Cambridge'16                       Re: A couple decides to have 4 children.

Bump seeking an answer to the question above: I got 1/5 as well. BBBB BBBG BBGG GGGB GGGG 1/5 outcomes The question doesn't say anything about the order. How do we know when order matters? In this case we are saying that the probability of BGGG is the same as the probability of BBGG. But that is not so. You can have 1 boy and 3 girls in 4 ways: BGGG, GBGG, GGBG, GGGB But you can have 2 boys and 2 girls in 6 ways: BBGG, BGGB, GGBB, BGBG, GBGB, GBBG So the probability depends on the number of ways in which you can get 2 boys and 2 girls. Think of it this way: if you throw two dice, is the probability of getting a sum of 2 same as the probability of getting a sum of 8? No. For sum fo 2, you must get 1 + 1 only. For sum of 8, you could get 4 + 4 or 3 + 5 or 2 + 6 etc. So probability of getting sum of 8 would be higher. In the same way, the order matters in this question. _________________  Karishma Veritas Prep | GMAT Instructor My Blog  Get started with Veritas Prep GMAT On Demand for $199 Veritas Prep Reviews                          ManonLi      Intern           Joined: 01 Nov 2014   Posts: 16                      Re: A couple decides to have 4 children.

We can solve this problem in a couple of ways. First, realize that there are 2^4 = 16 total possibilities (boy/girl = 2 options * 4 instances). Next, you can realize that there is 1 way to have all boys and 1 way to have all girls. So the total number of invalid options is 2. Then, if you have 1 boy and 3 girls or if you have 1 girl and 3 boys, then you the chances of these outcomes occurring should be equal. And there are 4 ways to have 1 boy, so there must be 4 ways to have one girl. The total number of invalid cases is 2+4+4 = 10 out of 16 total options. So the number we care about is the remaining number of options with 2 boys and 2 girls = 16-10 = 6. 6/16 = 3/8.                          guialain      Manager        S     Joined: 01 Dec 2016   Posts: 121   Concentration: Finance, Entrepreneurship   Schools:  Insead Sept'18 (A) , Booth (A) , Stern (A)    GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V34     WE: Investment Banking (Investment Banking)                       Re: A couple decides to have 4 children. If they succeed in having 4 child [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     19 Jun 2017, 02:56      I did it the binomial way. Proba of having a girl is same as proba of having a boy, which is 1/2. Proba of having exactly 2 girls and 2 boys is given by 4C2 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6/16 or 3/8. Answer is A The question would be much more interesting if proba of having a girl was 1/3 for instance, and we were asked to find the proba of having exactly 3 girls and 1 boy. In this case the answer would have been: 4C3 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81. Binomial Proba is fast and easy... _________________   What was previously considered impossible is now obvious reality .

Thanks. This explanation is much simpler than the one in the source. I've been using the F/T rule in most of my previous problems.

Hi Fluke, How does the combination of BGG and GBG vary?

Each child could be boy or girl --> 2 ways for C1; 2 ways for C2; 2 ways for C3. We have total 2x2x2 = 8 ways. It means you considered the order already i.e. BGB # BBG. Thus, when you count the combination (1boy, 2 girls), you have to consider the order . So we have three orders that have 1 boy and 2 girls BGG; GBG; GGB => probability = 3/8 Hope it's clear. _________________  Please +1 KUDO if my post helps. Thank you.

I remember this kind of query coming on from a member  anyways, you pre-arranged the sets here by saying 1 boy and three girls or two boys and two girls  these are not total possible outcomes but rather the sets pre-arranged by you  Plz compare children A,B,C,D may be borne with two independent gender type - male or female  when you say two boys and two girls it's not one outcome, but this is one event  the no of outcomes for this event is 6, two boys and two girls can be formed AB, CD, AD, AC, BD, BC  the same way all your events one boy and three girls -> no of outcomes would be 4C3  all four boys or girls 4C4  anyways, you need to understand the difference between event and outcome here  quit boys and girls, consider each child as a coin and it may land tail/head when tossed - probability 1/2 (independence of events) in any combination the set with probabilities (yes will be boy and no will not be boy) is 1/2 by 1/2 and so on.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!  You'll also want to see: What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?             Gender Odds   What are the odds of having another boy or girl?

There are 4 things that increase your chances of having a girl.
1. Have sex from the last day of your period (every day) to just 3 or 4 days before you are ovulating. You can do this with an ovulation kit. Studies have shown that girl sperm live much longer than boy sperm. Doing this will allow the girl sperm to stay alive long enough to fertilize the egg without having to compete with the boy sperm who will get there faster.
2. Eat foods that are very acidic. Girl sperm are not harmed by acidic levels and boy sperm usually die off and do better in alkali environments.
3. Use sexual positions that have shallow penetration, such as the missionary, that will leave the boy sperm furthest away from the egg as possible (because they are faster.)
4. It has also been suggested that it is better for the woman to NOT orgasm because it will make the environment more alkali.                 k.fordahl    Answered 1/17/09               52 found this helpful     You can&#39;t control the sex of your baby. It&#39;s impossible it all depends on the genetic makeup of the sperm.                 wood93    Answered 7/11/14               25 found this helpful     I&#39;d never heard much about acid/alkali, but we used the Shettles (sp?) method. Basically, you are fertile for four days. Use an ovulation test daily for a month so you can see how long you are fertile. The first day (or two) the strip starts to show fertility, you are more likely to get a girl (we did) and the later days when the strip is bold, solid, and dark, more likely to get a boy (we did). Another post said something like this too in a much more articulated way about the way the girls live longer etc... ;o)                 Jessie Johnson 6806    Answered 7/9/13               25 found this helpful     OH, and NO orgasm for the girl if you want a little princess...                 HarkerMommy    Answered 5/28/11               21 found this helpful     A report recently came out that women with high calorie diets, including eating breakfast(cereal), were more likely to conceive boys. And, that women with reduced calorie diets were then more likely to conceive girls. I am not really sure why this would be, since it is the sperm that determines the sex of the baby. Maybe the calories somehow change the womans reproductive tract environment, making it more or less favorable to an x or y sperm? With that being said, Victoria Beckham (who reportedly only eats 900 calories a day) has 3 sons.                 timmy mac mom    Answered 5/3/08               19 found this helpful     Ok my new partner has 2 teen sons and wants a girl so I looked in to all this. I&#39;m sorry to say that there is no sure way to up the chances of a girl and no provable scientific face. You can try most of the suggestions but please do some research before trying any as some can be harmful to your body and some can reduced your chances of getting pregnant. I love my partner and I know she wants a little girl more than anything but honestly please don&#39;t try anything that may harm your baby&#39;s development           a BabyCenter member   Answered 8/27/16               19 found this helpful     It depends on what kind of foods you are putting in your diet.. along with shallow penetration (have him release as far out as he can without pulling out completely), timing (do it everyday after your period up until 3-4 days before ovulation. Your boy days are during ovulation. The girls will last longer while the males die off) your diet also can make your environment more friendly toward male (eat lots of sodium/potassium rich foods-- potatoes etc.) or female (lots of calcium/magnesium rich foods-- whole grain cereal, green leafy veggies, yogurt, cranberry juice etc) You can also take supplements for calcium &amp; Magnesium to increase your chances. If you take the pH of your vagina before sex (be sure that it is around a pH of 4 for a girl) and also after sex just to be sure that it remains in that acidic pH level. (you can use certain douches, and replens to keep your environment acidic)

She sat down and started talking to us about my pregnancy and we were telling her how we were having a girl and how next time my husband would really like a boy.

 She told us a really sad story about how her husband left her after finding out she was pregnant with a girl and so she did a lot of research on how to conceive a boy in order to get him back. She told us low sodium and low red meat diets will increase your chances for a girl and that when we are trying for a boy to start eating tons of meat and a high sodium diet. Males are dependent on the girl gene. This might just be a old wives tale. But trying anything can help right!?
