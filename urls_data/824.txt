Here are the common mistakes they found and the prevalence of those errors.  [ Read full story ]   1. Late application: Between 17 percent and 51.1 percent of people reported putting a condom on after intercourse has already begun. Other studies found that late application happens in 1.5 percent to 24.8 percent of sexual encounters.   2. Early removal: Between 13.6 percent and 44.7 percent of individuals in the studies had taken a condom off before intercourse was over. Other studies found that early removal happens in between 1.4 percent and 26.9 percent of sexual encounters.   3. Unrolling a condom before putting it on: Between 2.1 percent and 25.3 percent of people reported completely unrolling a condom before putting it on.   4. No space at the tip: Failing to leave a reservoir for semen was reported by between 24.3 percent and 45.7 percent of respondents, depending on the study.   5. Failing to remove air: Almost half (48.1 percent) of women and 41.6 percent of men reported sexual encounters in which air wasn't squeezed from the tip of the condom.   6. Inside-out condoms: Between 4 percent and 30.4 percent of people reported rolling on a condom inside out and then flipping it the other way around, potentially exposing their partner to bodily fluids.   7. Failing to unroll all the way: 11.2 percent of women and 8.8 percent of men had started intercourse before a condom was unrolled all the way.   8. Exposure to sharp objects: Between 2.1 percent and 11.2 percent of people had opened condom packets with sharp objects or otherwise exposed the latex to tearing.   9. Not checking for damage: Meanwhile, 82.7 percent of women and 74.5 percent of men failed to check condoms for damage before use.   10. No lubrication: Between 16 percent and 25.8 percent of participants had used condoms without lubrication, increasing the risk of a break.   11. Wrong lubrication: In about 4.1 percent of sexual events, people used oil-based lubrications with latex, which can degrade the condom. About 3.2 percent of women and 4.7 percent of men reported this error.   12. Incorrect withdrawal: Failing to promptly and properly withdraw after ejaculation was a common mistake, occurring in up to 57 percent of encounters in one study. About 31 percent of men and 27 percent of women reported this error.   13. Condom reuse: Between 1.4 percent and 3.3 percent of study respondents had re-used a condom at least twice during a sexual encounter.   14. Incorrect storage: Between 3.3 percent and 19.1 percent of people in the studies had stored condoms in conditions outside of the recommendations on the package.  While perfect condom use has a 98 percent success rate at preventing pregnancy, errors can increase the risk of breakage, slippage or other condom failure. Here are the rates for those problems:   Breakage: In various studies, between 0.8 percent and 40.7 percent of participants reported the experience of a broken condom. In some studies, the rates of sex with a broken condom were as high as 32.8 percent.   Slippage: Between 13.1 percent and 19.3 percent of participants reported condom slippage.   Leakage: Condoms leaked in between 0.4 percent and 6.5 percent of sexual encounters studied, with 7.6 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women reporting an experience with a leaky condom.

Everywoman's Health Centre       Condoms    A male or external condom is a covering that fits over an erect penis, almost like a second skin. A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription. It is about 50% effective overall. Ella, which is slightly more effective at 60% is also available by prescription. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.   What kind of condoms should you use?   All brands of condoms are quality tested in Canada, so will be of high quality. However, sometimes condoms are novelty or joke items. Always look to see if the package says the condom will protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Male/external condoms are available in different sizes. Regular sized condoms will fit most people, but if condoms are breaking or slipping off regularly then you may need larger or smaller sized condoms. Sometimes this problem can be solved with more lubrication (see the section about “using a male/external condom” for more information).  Most condoms are made of latex. Some people have latex allergies or sensitivities, so there are condoms made with different materials that you can try. The most common latex alternative is polyurethane (all female/internal condoms are made from polyurethane and some male/external ones are too). There are also some condoms made from animal skin – however, these only protect against pregnancy and not against STIs.  Male condoms are the most commonly used. However, with female or internal condoms , women can have more control over condom use. They can even sometimes be used without a partner knowing, if negotiating condom use is difficult. They are also less likely to break and transfer heat better which for some people can increase sensation. However, they are slightly less effective, more expensive and can also sometimes make noise during intercourse.   Before using a condom   Get familiar with condoms ahead of time. It is best if the first time you see, touch or use a condom is before rather than during sex. Take a condom out of its package, get used to it, try putting it on yourself or on a vegetable or fruit. The more comfortable you are with condoms, the better chance you will be able to use them successfully.  Condoms are most effective when both partners are familiar with them and how they are used.  Communicate with your partner about birth control and condoms before, during and after sex. It is best to make sure you are on the same page about condom use and the amount of risk you are comfortable with ahead of time. It is also important that both of you know that a condom is being used and if it has broken or slipped off so that you can take extra precautions if needed (see the section on about if a condom breaks or slips off).  Store condoms somewhere cool and dry. Heat and sunlight can damage condoms.  Always check the expiry date before using a condom. If the expiry date has passed do not use the condom.  “Pillow test” the condom – before opening it, fold and squeeze the package together into a U-shape. If air escapes and the package goes flat rather than pillowy when folded, then do not use it as there may be tears in the package.  Open the package down the jagged edge and remove it gently. Using teeth or long nails can tear a condom.  Look at the condom to make sure there is no discolouration or flakiness. If there is, throw it away.  Think about whether you would like to use another form of birth control along with condoms – for more information on this, please see our website at ca  Consider whether you would prefer to use male/external condoms (which this handout focuses on) , or female /internal ones. Female/internal condoms go inside the vagina (or can be used anally as well) rather than on the penis.  If you want more information about the female/internal condom, see our website at ca    Using a male/external condom         Use water-based lubricant (lube) to help condoms feel better and be less likely to break or slip off. Start with a lubricated condom and add more to the outside of the condom as well as a few drops in the tip before it is rolled on.  Do not get oil-based products (ex. hand lotion, Vaseline, and lipstick or lip balm) on a condom or it may break.  Put the condom onto the tip of the penis with the rolled up rim facing outward . If you put the condom on the wrong way, it will not roll down. If this happens, discard it because there might already be fluid on it (preejaculate or precum) that can get someone pregnant or give them an STI.  Pinch the tip so that there is no air inside and room for the ejaculate (semen).  Roll the condom down to the base of the penis.  Spermicides can make condoms more effective at preventing pregnancy. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry date, read the instructions, and follow them closely.  It can be good to check the condom during sex to make sure it is not breaking or slipping off.  This can be done regularly throughout intercourse, when shifting positions and/or if the sensation changes (i.e. you start having more or less feeling, the condom feels pulled tight or so on).           Removing and discarding a male/external condom           Withdraw the penis while it is still hard so there is less chance of fluids leaking and move away from the vagina before taking the condom off.  Hold the condom while slowly pulling it off bit by bit, keeping the semen inside. Do not pull from the tip.  Check the condom to see if it is broken. Observe whether fluids are leaking out or if it has any obvious tears.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.            Using a female/internal condom             Insert the condom before intercourse begins – it can be inserted up to 6 hours before, but most people insert it between 2 to 20 minutes before.  Squeeze the loose inner ring together and insert the closed end of the condom high in the vagina.  The outside ring of the condom then lies against the outer lips of the vagina , providing additional protection against STIs.  Hold the outside ring when the penis is first inserted to ensure it goes inside the condom (not along the side) and to prevent the condom from being pushed into the vagina.  If the condom makes noise during sex try changing positions or adding lubricant inside the condom.              Removing and discarding a female/internal condom             After intercourse is finished and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep fluids inside and pull the condom out gently. Be careful not to spill semen near the vagina when you are removing the condom.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.             If a condom breaks or slips off         Discard condom (see above). Use a new condom if you are going to continue having intercourse.  Emergency Pills: Back up with an emergency pill like Plan B or Ella. Plan B and other progestin emergency pills are available at pharmacies without a prescription and you can buy it in advance to have at home. It is approximately 50% effective overall and can be taken up to 5 days after sex, but the sooner you take it the more likely it is to work. Ella is available by prescription. It is more effective overall (approximately 60%) and does not lose effectiveness as quickly over time. They cost $20-$40.  Copper IUD:  : a Copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency birth control – it is over 99% effective at preventing a pregnancy if inserted any time within 7 days after unprotected sex. If you leave the IUD in, it will continue to provide very effective (over 99%) protection. If you do not like it or want to get pregnant, you can have it taken out any time after your next period.  Reassess: if a condom breaks or slips off, it can be a good time to think about whether you want to do something differently with regards to birth control. Is there something you could do to make condoms work better for you? Do you need a more effective method of contraception or something to use in combination with condoms         Questions about condom use or birth control?

Can I get a STI if... We use a condom? Yes, there is still a risk of contracting STIs.  Although condoms are a great way to prevent STIs, they are not 100% effective because: Some STIs are transmitted differently than others. Some STIs are transmitted through vaginal fluid, seminal fluid and/or blood, but others are transmitted through skin-to-skin contact.  A condom can act as a barrier for fluids but it does not eliminate all skin-to-skin contact.  As a result, transmission of STIs such as herpes, HPV,  syphilis, pubic lice, or scabies can occur even if a condom is used. Condoms are not always used correctly.   Condoms that are not used correctly can put someone at risk for infection.  STIs can be transmitted if the condom: breaks, is used after initial sexual contact, is torn, or comes off completely. For tips on how to use condoms correctly click here . I have never had penetrative sex? Yes.  As mentioned above, some STIs are transmitted just through skin-to-skin contact where penetration is not necessary. Also, abstaining from penetrative sex but engaging in other types of sex, such as oral sex, can pose a risk for infections. I give or receive oral sex? Yes, you can get an STI from oral sex because fluids (seminal and vaginal) are exchanged and direct skin-to-skin contact occurs. STIs that can be transmitted through oral sex include herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis and HPV. You can make oral sex safer by using a condom or an oral dam and avoiding oral sex during a herpes or cold sore outbreak. What’s an oral dam? A dam is a rectangular piece of latex or polyurethane that is used for oral-vaginal or oral-anal sex.  The dam is placed between one partner’s mouth and the other partner’s genitals. If you do not have a dental dam you can make one by cutting the ring end off a male/external condom and cutting up the side of the condom to create a flat, rectangle. You can also make an oral dam by cutting up a latex glove.  For more information on risk of infections click here . I have a long term partner? Even people who are in long term monogamous relationships can get STIs.  Some STIs, such as herpes or HPV, can lie dormant in a person for months or years before they are diagnosed.  For example, the most common test for herpes is a swab of a suspected lesion; testing for herpes is not standard practice, so it is possible that a person may have herpes for years and not know it until they pass the infection to a partner. Sometimes STIs are spread in ‘monogamous’ relationships because one partner is secretly having sex outside the relationship.  Having more than one partner or having a partner that has more than one partner increases the chances of getting an STI. Regardless of how long you have been in your relationship, regular annual screening for STIs is recommended.  For information on where you can get tested click here. My partner and I are virgins? If neither of you have ever had oral-genital, hand-genital or genital-genital contact with another person then you are not at risk for STIs.  All of these activities carry varying risks for STI transmission. For more information on the level of risk of transmission based on type of sexual activities and types of STI, visit here . I have tested negative for STIs? Testing negative for STIs is a good indicator that you do not have an infection.  Sometimes false negative results can occur when testing is performed too soon after exposure.  For example, testing for HIV needs to be confirmed three to six months after the date of potential exposure as it can take from six weeks to six months for your body to produce enough antibodies to be detected by the test. This is known as a window period. Also, make sure to ask which STIs your health practitioner is testing for you.  Some infections like HPV, genital warts, and herpes are not routinely tested. I use the same toilet, clothes, towels or utensils as someone with an STI? The transmission of STIs that are caused by viruses and bacteria is highly unlikely through the shared use of a toilet, clothes, towels, or utensils with someone who has an STI. The bacteria and viruses that are responsible for causing STIs require a living host in order to “live” and multiply. Depending on the type of bacteria or virus, direct skin-to-skin contact or the passing of bodily fluids such as blood, vaginal fluid, semen, or breast milk between an infected person and another person is required for the transmission of an STI. The only STIs that can be transmitted by sharing personal items like infected clothes and linens are those caused by parasitic insects. These two STIs are called pubic lice (or crabs) and scabies. Both of these STIs are non-life threatening and can be easily treated with the use of simple preparations or lotions such as Kwell and Nix. I kiss someone with an STI? There is minimal risk of getting an STI through kissing. However, there is a small risk of being exposed to the herpes virus if your partner has an open sore or lesion on his/her mouth. The herpes virus can be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact; therefore, you can transmit the herpes virus if you place your mouth in direct contact with an open sore or lesion around your partner’s mouth. I masturbate? Thankfully, No!  Masturbation is the safest form of sex.          Clinic finder »    Need to talk? 1-800-SEX-SENSE    Sex Sense  Have a sexual health related question?  Ask our experts!

KidsHealth / For Teens / How Can Condoms Break?     Print My friend was using a condom and said it tore. How is that possible?  – Shawn*  Condoms can sometimes rip or tear, but using and storing them properly can help reduce this risk.  Heat, sun, oils, and chemicals all can weaken condoms, making them more susceptible to breakage. Keep condoms away from heat and light, which can dry them out. And, don't use oils or lotions with a condom, only water-based lubricants. Carrying a condom in your wallet, where it may be folded or sat on, can also wear down the material and cause the condom to break. Also, don't open a condom with anything sharp, like scissors or teeth.  Check the expiration date on the condom. The material used to make condoms can weaken over time, so don't use one that has expired.  Condoms may rip during use if they don't fit properly or if they are not put on correctly (such as not leaving enough room at the tip of the condom). They also can tear if there is too much friction and not enough lubrication, or if the condom comes into contact with a person's nails, rings, piercings, teeth, or other sharp edges.  Condoms are the only type of birth control that can help prevent both pregnancy and STDs. So it's important to use and store them properly. A new condom should be used with each act of sex, and should be used from beginning to end.  If a condom breaks and you or your partner is concerned about pregnancy, call your health care provider or pharmacist to discuss emergency contraception . And both partners should be tested for STDs. People are often not aware that they have an infection but if an infection isn't treated, it could cause serious problems.

Here are the common mistakes they found and the prevalence of those errors.  [ Read full story ]   1. Late application: Between 17 percent and 51.1 percent of people reported putting a condom on after intercourse has already begun. Other studies found that late application happens in 1.5 percent to 24.8 percent of sexual encounters.   2. Early removal: Between 13.6 percent and 44.7 percent of individuals in the studies had taken a condom off before intercourse was over. Other studies found that early removal happens in between 1.4 percent and 26.9 percent of sexual encounters.   3. Unrolling a condom before putting it on: Between 2.1 percent and 25.3 percent of people reported completely unrolling a condom before putting it on.   4. No space at the tip: Failing to leave a reservoir for semen was reported by between 24.3 percent and 45.7 percent of respondents, depending on the study.   5. Failing to remove air: Almost half (48.1 percent) of women and 41.6 percent of men reported sexual encounters in which air wasn't squeezed from the tip of the condom.   6. Inside-out condoms: Between 4 percent and 30.4 percent of people reported rolling on a condom inside out and then flipping it the other way around, potentially exposing their partner to bodily fluids.   7. Failing to unroll all the way: 11.2 percent of women and 8.8 percent of men had started intercourse before a condom was unrolled all the way.   8. Exposure to sharp objects: Between 2.1 percent and 11.2 percent of people had opened condom packets with sharp objects or otherwise exposed the latex to tearing.   9. Not checking for damage: Meanwhile, 82.7 percent of women and 74.5 percent of men failed to check condoms for damage before use.   10. No lubrication: Between 16 percent and 25.8 percent of participants had used condoms without lubrication, increasing the risk of a break.   11. Wrong lubrication: In about 4.1 percent of sexual events, people used oil-based lubrications with latex, which can degrade the condom. About 3.2 percent of women and 4.7 percent of men reported this error.   12. Incorrect withdrawal: Failing to promptly and properly withdraw after ejaculation was a common mistake, occurring in up to 57 percent of encounters in one study. About 31 percent of men and 27 percent of women reported this error.   13. Condom reuse: Between 1.4 percent and 3.3 percent of study respondents had re-used a condom at least twice during a sexual encounter.   14. Incorrect storage: Between 3.3 percent and 19.1 percent of people in the studies had stored condoms in conditions outside of the recommendations on the package.  While perfect condom use has a 98 percent success rate at preventing pregnancy, errors can increase the risk of breakage, slippage or other condom failure. Here are the rates for those problems:   Breakage: In various studies, between 0.8 percent and 40.7 percent of participants reported the experience of a broken condom. In some studies, the rates of sex with a broken condom were as high as 32.8 percent.   Slippage: Between 13.1 percent and 19.3 percent of participants reported condom slippage.   Leakage: Condoms leaked in between 0.4 percent and 6.5 percent of sexual encounters studied, with 7.6 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women reporting an experience with a leaky condom.

First, don't give up. Second, make sure you're using the right condoms the right way.    published 2015-02-23T16:30:00Z     We’ve all been there. Things are heating up and you both know exactly what you want to happen next. One of you whispers those five crucial words: “Do you have a condom?” and the other produces one (or, better still, several) triumphantly. You’re happily getting it on when you realize the condom tore or slipped off…  Condoms are easy, cheap, and offer protection against STIs and accidental pregnancy. Here’s the thing—they only work if you use them the right way. To help you do that, we’ve teamed up with Melissa White, CEO and founder of Lucky Bloke , to tell you how to avoid the six most common condom problems.  1. Help—the condom broke!  The good news is there are many ways to reduce the chance of a condom breaking. If you find yourself dealing with a broken condom situation, here’s what to do.  What now? If you realize right away (before anyone has gotten close to climaxing) that the condom broke, you can throw out the broken condom and try another one. Before you start again though you should make sure there isn’t something wrong with your condoms. Are the packages intact? Are your condoms expired? Were they exposed to extreme heat or cold? If not, you can use a new condom and just watch out for breakage.  If there’s a possibility of preejaculate or ejaculate, the safest thing to do is take emergency contraception (EC) . You can take EC up to five days after you have unprotected sex but most kinds work better the sooner you take them. Here’s how to get some . You may also want to get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if you’re not sure of your partner’s status. (And remember, you definitely can’t tell if someone has an STI just by looking !)  So it doesn’t happen again: Condoms can work very well when you use them right. If you’ve had a condom break, here are a few things to check to make sure it doesn’t happen again.   Size. When someone repeatedly has experiences with condoms breaking, it may mean the condom is too small. This doesn’t always mean a guy requires a large condom, though. A different kind of standard (or medium) size may work.  Lube.  Using lube can make using a condom a lot more pleasurable. Pro-tip—apply a small amount of lube to the penis before applying the condom. (If you are using the proper size condom, this should not cause the condom to slip.) Use a generous application of lube to the outside.  Packaging. It’s important to make sure you’re opening the condom package carefully. We know you may be tempted to rip it open or use your teeth to get things going asap, but opening the package the wrong way can tear the condom.  Putting it on. To make sure you put the condom on correctly, be sure to pinch the tip while rolling it on. It’s important to leave room room for the finale!   2. Uh oh…looks like the condom leaked.  If you notice semen anywhere outside the condom during sex or after, it’s time to take extra steps to make sure you don’t get pregnant.  What now? Again, taking EC as soon as possible is the best way to reduce your risk of accidental pregnancy. Getting tested for STIs is a good idea if you don’t know your partner’s status.  So it doesn’t happen again: If a condom is leaking from the base it’s probably too big. This happens more often than one might think, as 35% of men require a smaller than standard condoms. Smaller condoms are rarely available at your local store but you can get them through websites like Lucky Bloke , Condomania , and Condom Jungle . By simply switching to a condom that fits properly you will avoid this situation in the future. If you’re using a standard condom, try small. If you’re using a large condom, try standard.  If the condom is leaking from the top or the middle, it could have a tear—see the section above on broken condoms.  3. The condom fell off…and got stuck!  This one can be scary, especially if you have trouble finding and retrieving the condom. Don’t panic.  What now? If the condom falls off, once again it’s time to take EC and go for STI testing. If it gets stuck inside you or your partner, here’s Cosmo ’s advice: “lie back, relax, and insert one or two fingers inside of you and try to pull it out” . Don’t panic if you have trouble getting the condom out—hopefully it will come out on its own after a bit. If it doesn’t, head to your health care provider to remove it.  So it doesn’t happen again: This is another situation where the condom is probably too big—try a smaller size.  4. The condom doesn’t feel good and he can’t get hard.  If a condom is too tight or uncomfortable, he can lose his erection. It’s not you, it’s the condom, so don’t feel embarrassed—you can still save the night!  What now? There’s always the classic midnight condom run to get a different kind of condom, but if that’s not an option, opt for a cuddle and a movie and next time you hang out, come prepared.  So it doesn’t happen again: Again, it’s all about the fit. Even if a condom is not too tight, sometimes the fit is just uncomfortable. A good way to avoid this is to try out different kinds of condoms. (We like the sound of that!) Lucky Bloke has a “Not Sure What Size to Buy” condom sampler if you think size could be the issue. They also offer lots of other samplers if you just want to explore your options. You can also get variety packs through a bunch of other online retailers like Amazon , Condom Jungle , Sustain , and Condomania .  5. I think we’re allergic to condoms…  If you’re getting down and dirty and one of you starts getting itchy and irritated, it may be an allergic reaction to the condom you’re using.  What now? Give it a rest for the time-being and ditch the condom you’re using—no one wants to feel irritated! Go see your health care provider to find out what’s going on down there.  So it doesn’t happen again: If you’re allergic to latex, there are some great alternatives out there that protect from STIs and pregnancy and offer amazing sensitivity, heightened feeling, and heat transfer. Note that lambskin condoms, while in the non-latex category, are not ideal for everyone since they protect against pregnancy but not against STIs like HIV. Other non-latex condoms provide dual protection from pregnancy and STIs.  6. But won’t this cling wrap do the same thing?  Everybody knows someone who knows someone who used a plastic bag that one time. This is not a good idea . It seems like a no-brainer, but if you are turned on and can’t find a condom anywhere, cling wrap starts to sound more appealing. If you find yourself facing a spontaneous decision about whether to use anything for a condom other than a real condom , here’s what to do.  What now: Stop right there. Any material other than an actual condom will not work to prevent pregnancy and protect you from STIs. Go on a spontaneous condom run—you’d be surprised where you can find condoms !  So it doesn’t happen again: Your best bet for preventing this problem in the future is to carry condoms with you. They’re easy to tuck away into pockets and purses and it’s sexy to be prepared. Just make sure you don’t keep them too long in a pocket or purse or expose them to extreme temperatures.  What we’ve learned…  Most of these mishaps could be avoided by using the proper size condom. If your partner needs a snugger-fit condom, you might feel uncomfortable about approaching the subject. “I’d always suggest focusing on the pleasure aspect—you both will benefit.” says Melissa. “If you are using a condom that fits, your focus will be on each other and not on the condom.”  If you are having condom woes, a better fit condom—or a higher-quality condom—is going to be the solution in most cases.

Its the friction from the girl that makes it break.                    08-01-2011, 07:25 PM    #12        Dave1958     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Registered User       Join Date: May 2007  Age: 59  Posts: 994  Rep Power: 814                           Lube is your friend.

This one, right here.  You don't leave air in the tip to catch your baby juice... Gotta pinch the air OUT. Most of the time the tip will burst, and the rest will shred from the friction... Which leads to: keep 'em wet.

No breaking or slippage so far with a year of total active sex life. plenty of lube and squeeze air out of the tip, simple as that.                    08-02-2011, 10:41 PM    #16        Bunpitsu     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Britisher       Join Date: Jan 2010  Location: United Kingdom (Great Britain)  Posts: 5,378  Rep Power: 3805                           Never had a condom break in my life thus far. I'd chalk the vast majority of breakages up to;  1) Lack of application (not squeezing the tip, etc)  2) Using lubricant with the condom (if she's wet, it isn't even necessary. If she asks for it; you can't turn her on)  3) You are a phaggot  As for condoms slipping off, I've never experienced that either. I'm average in length, yet slightly thicker in girth. I can only imagine guys who experience slipping frequently have dicks like fast-food straws.                    08-02-2011, 11:22 PM    #17        AgRyan     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Bangarang.

Tiffanie Davis Henry, PhD    Psychology         It is possible for a condom to break during sex, but generally not due to manufacturer defect but more likely "user error."  It is safe to assume that condoms have been tested for quality prior to leaving the factory and that they are highly effective in protecting us against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  While nothing is 100% fool-proof, there are a few things that you can do to ensure you have the best condom experience.  To minimize the chances of your condom breaking, follow these 6 simple steps: Use The Right Lube - While many condoms come pre-lubricated, you may want to use your own.  That's perfectly fine.  Be sure that your lube choice is not oil-based (baby oil, vaseline, olive oil, etc.) as they can break down the integrity of the condom, causing it to thin out and break. Put It On Properly - Condoms should be placed on the top of the penis (like a little sombrero), squeezing the tip-like reservoir and gently rolled down to cover.  Squeezing the tip before rolling it down insures that you don't have excess air inside the condom, reducing the chance for breakage. Check The Expiration Date - Pretty much self explanatory but if the date on your condom wrapper or box has expired, it's best to throw it out and get new ones. Get The Right Fit - Condoms come in different sizes. Make sure you find a brand and size that fits securely, no gaps, but isn't too tight.  Too snug can burst.  Too loose can leak. Keep Away From Heat - Your wallet and the glove compartment of your car are no place for condom storage.  Be sure to store your unused condoms in a cool, dry, dark place (a drawer in your night stand, your naughty toy box, etc.) so that they're good to go when you are. No Teeth - Always open your condom wrapper with your fingers.  NEVER use your teeth or scissors to open.  Doing so increases your risk of tearing or puncturing the condom.                   Boston Women's Health Book Collective    Administration         A small percentage of condoms do break during sex. When they are used correctly, however, this rarely happens. Condoms are more likely to break if there is a lack of lubrication, so use a water-based lubricant to avoid this. Polyurethane condoms are more likely to break than latex ones.

Here are the common mistakes they found and the prevalence of those errors.  [ Read full story ]   1. Late application: Between 17 percent and 51.1 percent of people reported putting a condom on after intercourse has already begun. Other studies found that late application happens in 1.5 percent to 24.8 percent of sexual encounters.   2. Early removal: Between 13.6 percent and 44.7 percent of individuals in the studies had taken a condom off before intercourse was over. Other studies found that early removal happens in between 1.4 percent and 26.9 percent of sexual encounters.   3. Unrolling a condom before putting it on: Between 2.1 percent and 25.3 percent of people reported completely unrolling a condom before putting it on.   4. No space at the tip: Failing to leave a reservoir for semen was reported by between 24.3 percent and 45.7 percent of respondents, depending on the study.   5. Failing to remove air: Almost half (48.1 percent) of women and 41.6 percent of men reported sexual encounters in which air wasn't squeezed from the tip of the condom.   6. Inside-out condoms: Between 4 percent and 30.4 percent of people reported rolling on a condom inside out and then flipping it the other way around, potentially exposing their partner to bodily fluids.   7. Failing to unroll all the way: 11.2 percent of women and 8.8 percent of men had started intercourse before a condom was unrolled all the way.   8. Exposure to sharp objects: Between 2.1 percent and 11.2 percent of people had opened condom packets with sharp objects or otherwise exposed the latex to tearing.   9. Not checking for damage: Meanwhile, 82.7 percent of women and 74.5 percent of men failed to check condoms for damage before use.   10. No lubrication: Between 16 percent and 25.8 percent of participants had used condoms without lubrication, increasing the risk of a break.   11. Wrong lubrication: In about 4.1 percent of sexual events, people used oil-based lubrications with latex, which can degrade the condom. About 3.2 percent of women and 4.7 percent of men reported this error.   12. Incorrect withdrawal: Failing to promptly and properly withdraw after ejaculation was a common mistake, occurring in up to 57 percent of encounters in one study. About 31 percent of men and 27 percent of women reported this error.   13. Condom reuse: Between 1.4 percent and 3.3 percent of study respondents had re-used a condom at least twice during a sexual encounter.   14. Incorrect storage: Between 3.3 percent and 19.1 percent of people in the studies had stored condoms in conditions outside of the recommendations on the package.  While perfect condom use has a 98 percent success rate at preventing pregnancy, errors can increase the risk of breakage, slippage or other condom failure. Here are the rates for those problems:   Breakage: In various studies, between 0.8 percent and 40.7 percent of participants reported the experience of a broken condom. In some studies, the rates of sex with a broken condom were as high as 32.8 percent.   Slippage: Between 13.1 percent and 19.3 percent of participants reported condom slippage.   Leakage: Condoms leaked in between 0.4 percent and 6.5 percent of sexual encounters studied, with 7.6 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women reporting an experience with a leaky condom.

Everywoman's Health Centre       Condoms    A male or external condom is a covering that fits over an erect penis, almost like a second skin. A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription. It is about 50% effective overall. Ella, which is slightly more effective at 60% is also available by prescription. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.   What kind of condoms should you use?   All brands of condoms are quality tested in Canada, so will be of high quality. However, sometimes condoms are novelty or joke items. Always look to see if the package says the condom will protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Male/external condoms are available in different sizes. Regular sized condoms will fit most people, but if condoms are breaking or slipping off regularly then you may need larger or smaller sized condoms. Sometimes this problem can be solved with more lubrication (see the section about “using a male/external condom” for more information).  Most condoms are made of latex. Some people have latex allergies or sensitivities, so there are condoms made with different materials that you can try. The most common latex alternative is polyurethane (all female/internal condoms are made from polyurethane and some male/external ones are too). There are also some condoms made from animal skin – however, these only protect against pregnancy and not against STIs.  Male condoms are the most commonly used. However, with female or internal condoms , women can have more control over condom use. They can even sometimes be used without a partner knowing, if negotiating condom use is difficult. They are also less likely to break and transfer heat better which for some people can increase sensation. However, they are slightly less effective, more expensive and can also sometimes make noise during intercourse.   Before using a condom   Get familiar with condoms ahead of time. It is best if the first time you see, touch or use a condom is before rather than during sex. Take a condom out of its package, get used to it, try putting it on yourself or on a vegetable or fruit. The more comfortable you are with condoms, the better chance you will be able to use them successfully.  Condoms are most effective when both partners are familiar with them and how they are used.  Communicate with your partner about birth control and condoms before, during and after sex. It is best to make sure you are on the same page about condom use and the amount of risk you are comfortable with ahead of time. It is also important that both of you know that a condom is being used and if it has broken or slipped off so that you can take extra precautions if needed (see the section on about if a condom breaks or slips off).  Store condoms somewhere cool and dry. Heat and sunlight can damage condoms.  Always check the expiry date before using a condom. If the expiry date has passed do not use the condom.  “Pillow test” the condom – before opening it, fold and squeeze the package together into a U-shape. If air escapes and the package goes flat rather than pillowy when folded, then do not use it as there may be tears in the package.  Open the package down the jagged edge and remove it gently. Using teeth or long nails can tear a condom.  Look at the condom to make sure there is no discolouration or flakiness. If there is, throw it away.  Think about whether you would like to use another form of birth control along with condoms – for more information on this, please see our website at ca  Consider whether you would prefer to use male/external condoms (which this handout focuses on) , or female /internal ones. Female/internal condoms go inside the vagina (or can be used anally as well) rather than on the penis.  If you want more information about the female/internal condom, see our website at ca    Using a male/external condom         Use water-based lubricant (lube) to help condoms feel better and be less likely to break or slip off. Start with a lubricated condom and add more to the outside of the condom as well as a few drops in the tip before it is rolled on.  Do not get oil-based products (ex. hand lotion, Vaseline, and lipstick or lip balm) on a condom or it may break.  Put the condom onto the tip of the penis with the rolled up rim facing outward . If you put the condom on the wrong way, it will not roll down. If this happens, discard it because there might already be fluid on it (preejaculate or precum) that can get someone pregnant or give them an STI.  Pinch the tip so that there is no air inside and room for the ejaculate (semen).  Roll the condom down to the base of the penis.  Spermicides can make condoms more effective at preventing pregnancy. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry date, read the instructions, and follow them closely.  It can be good to check the condom during sex to make sure it is not breaking or slipping off.  This can be done regularly throughout intercourse, when shifting positions and/or if the sensation changes (i.e. you start having more or less feeling, the condom feels pulled tight or so on).           Removing and discarding a male/external condom           Withdraw the penis while it is still hard so there is less chance of fluids leaking and move away from the vagina before taking the condom off.  Hold the condom while slowly pulling it off bit by bit, keeping the semen inside. Do not pull from the tip.  Check the condom to see if it is broken. Observe whether fluids are leaking out or if it has any obvious tears.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.            Using a female/internal condom             Insert the condom before intercourse begins – it can be inserted up to 6 hours before, but most people insert it between 2 to 20 minutes before.  Squeeze the loose inner ring together and insert the closed end of the condom high in the vagina.  The outside ring of the condom then lies against the outer lips of the vagina , providing additional protection against STIs.  Hold the outside ring when the penis is first inserted to ensure it goes inside the condom (not along the side) and to prevent the condom from being pushed into the vagina.  If the condom makes noise during sex try changing positions or adding lubricant inside the condom.              Removing and discarding a female/internal condom             After intercourse is finished and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep fluids inside and pull the condom out gently. Be careful not to spill semen near the vagina when you are removing the condom.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.             If a condom breaks or slips off         Discard condom (see above). Use a new condom if you are going to continue having intercourse.  Emergency Pills: Back up with an emergency pill like Plan B or Ella. Plan B and other progestin emergency pills are available at pharmacies without a prescription and you can buy it in advance to have at home. It is approximately 50% effective overall and can be taken up to 5 days after sex, but the sooner you take it the more likely it is to work. Ella is available by prescription. It is more effective overall (approximately 60%) and does not lose effectiveness as quickly over time. They cost $20-$40.  Copper IUD:  : a Copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency birth control – it is over 99% effective at preventing a pregnancy if inserted any time within 7 days after unprotected sex. If you leave the IUD in, it will continue to provide very effective (over 99%) protection. If you do not like it or want to get pregnant, you can have it taken out any time after your next period.  Reassess: if a condom breaks or slips off, it can be a good time to think about whether you want to do something differently with regards to birth control. Is there something you could do to make condoms work better for you? Do you need a more effective method of contraception or something to use in combination with condoms         Questions about condom use or birth control?

Our 1-800 SEX SENSE Line receives lots of questions from people wondering “can I get a sexually transmitted infection if...” Here you will find information about how a sexually transmitted infection (STI) can occur.  If you have any other questions, call 1-800 SEX SENSE (1-800-739-7367) or 604-731-7803 in the lower mainland, or send an email to sexsense@optbc.org . Can I get a STI if... We use a condom? Yes, there is still a risk of contracting STIs.  Although condoms are a great way to prevent STIs, they are not 100% effective because: Some STIs are transmitted differently than others. Some STIs are transmitted through vaginal fluid, seminal fluid and/or blood, but others are transmitted through skin-to-skin contact.  A condom can act as a barrier for fluids but it does not eliminate all skin-to-skin contact.  As a result, transmission of STIs such as herpes, HPV,  syphilis, pubic lice, or scabies can occur even if a condom is used. Condoms are not always used correctly.   Condoms that are not used correctly can put someone at risk for infection.  STIs can be transmitted if the condom: breaks, is used after initial sexual contact, is torn, or comes off completely. For tips on how to use condoms correctly click here . I have never had penetrative sex? Yes.  As mentioned above, some STIs are transmitted just through skin-to-skin contact where penetration is not necessary. Also, abstaining from penetrative sex but engaging in other types of sex, such as oral sex, can pose a risk for infections. I give or receive oral sex? Yes, you can get an STI from oral sex because fluids (seminal and vaginal) are exchanged and direct skin-to-skin contact occurs. STIs that can be transmitted through oral sex include herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis and HPV. You can make oral sex safer by using a condom or an oral dam and avoiding oral sex during a herpes or cold sore outbreak. What’s an oral dam? A dam is a rectangular piece of latex or polyurethane that is used for oral-vaginal or oral-anal sex.  The dam is placed between one partner’s mouth and the other partner’s genitals. If you do not have a dental dam you can make one by cutting the ring end off a male/external condom and cutting up the side of the condom to create a flat, rectangle. You can also make an oral dam by cutting up a latex glove.  For more information on risk of infections click here . I have a long term partner? Even people who are in long term monogamous relationships can get STIs.  Some STIs, such as herpes or HPV, can lie dormant in a person for months or years before they are diagnosed.  For example, the most common test for herpes is a swab of a suspected lesion; testing for herpes is not standard practice, so it is possible that a person may have herpes for years and not know it until they pass the infection to a partner. Sometimes STIs are spread in ‘monogamous’ relationships because one partner is secretly having sex outside the relationship.  Having more than one partner or having a partner that has more than one partner increases the chances of getting an STI. Regardless of how long you have been in your relationship, regular annual screening for STIs is recommended.  For information on where you can get tested click here. My partner and I are virgins? If neither of you have ever had oral-genital, hand-genital or genital-genital contact with another person then you are not at risk for STIs.  All of these activities carry varying risks for STI transmission. For more information on the level of risk of transmission based on type of sexual activities and types of STI, visit here . I have tested negative for STIs? Testing negative for STIs is a good indicator that you do not have an infection.  Sometimes false negative results can occur when testing is performed too soon after exposure.  For example, testing for HIV needs to be confirmed three to six months after the date of potential exposure as it can take from six weeks to six months for your body to produce enough antibodies to be detected by the test. This is known as a window period. Also, make sure to ask which STIs your health practitioner is testing for you.  Some infections like HPV, genital warts, and herpes are not routinely tested. I use the same toilet, clothes, towels or utensils as someone with an STI? The transmission of STIs that are caused by viruses and bacteria is highly unlikely through the shared use of a toilet, clothes, towels, or utensils with someone who has an STI. The bacteria and viruses that are responsible for causing STIs require a living host in order to “live” and multiply. Depending on the type of bacteria or virus, direct skin-to-skin contact or the passing of bodily fluids such as blood, vaginal fluid, semen, or breast milk between an infected person and another person is required for the transmission of an STI. The only STIs that can be transmitted by sharing personal items like infected clothes and linens are those caused by parasitic insects. These two STIs are called pubic lice (or crabs) and scabies. Both of these STIs are non-life threatening and can be easily treated with the use of simple preparations or lotions such as Kwell and Nix. I kiss someone with an STI? There is minimal risk of getting an STI through kissing. However, there is a small risk of being exposed to the herpes virus if your partner has an open sore or lesion on his/her mouth. The herpes virus can be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact; therefore, you can transmit the herpes virus if you place your mouth in direct contact with an open sore or lesion around your partner’s mouth. I masturbate? Thankfully, No!  Masturbation is the safest form of sex.          Clinic finder »    Need to talk? 1-800-SEX-SENSE    Sex Sense  Have a sexual health related question?  Ask our experts!

KidsHealth / For Teens / How Can Condoms Break?     Print My friend was using a condom and said it tore. How is that possible?  – Shawn*  Condoms can sometimes rip or tear, but using and storing them properly can help reduce this risk.  Heat, sun, oils, and chemicals all can weaken condoms, making them more susceptible to breakage. Keep condoms away from heat and light, which can dry them out. And, don't use oils or lotions with a condom, only water-based lubricants. Carrying a condom in your wallet, where it may be folded or sat on, can also wear down the material and cause the condom to break. Also, don't open a condom with anything sharp, like scissors or teeth.  Check the expiration date on the condom. The material used to make condoms can weaken over time, so don't use one that has expired.  Condoms may rip during use if they don't fit properly or if they are not put on correctly (such as not leaving enough room at the tip of the condom). They also can tear if there is too much friction and not enough lubrication, or if the condom comes into contact with a person's nails, rings, piercings, teeth, or other sharp edges.  Condoms are the only type of birth control that can help prevent both pregnancy and STDs. So it's important to use and store them properly. A new condom should be used with each act of sex, and should be used from beginning to end.  If a condom breaks and you or your partner is concerned about pregnancy, call your health care provider or pharmacist to discuss emergency contraception . And both partners should be tested for STDs. People are often not aware that they have an infection but if an infection isn't treated, it could cause serious problems.

Here are the common mistakes they found and the prevalence of those errors.  [ Read full story ]   1. Late application: Between 17 percent and 51.1 percent of people reported putting a condom on after intercourse has already begun. Other studies found that late application happens in 1.5 percent to 24.8 percent of sexual encounters.   2. Early removal: Between 13.6 percent and 44.7 percent of individuals in the studies had taken a condom off before intercourse was over. Other studies found that early removal happens in between 1.4 percent and 26.9 percent of sexual encounters.   3. Unrolling a condom before putting it on: Between 2.1 percent and 25.3 percent of people reported completely unrolling a condom before putting it on.   4. No space at the tip: Failing to leave a reservoir for semen was reported by between 24.3 percent and 45.7 percent of respondents, depending on the study.   5. Failing to remove air: Almost half (48.1 percent) of women and 41.6 percent of men reported sexual encounters in which air wasn't squeezed from the tip of the condom.   6. Inside-out condoms: Between 4 percent and 30.4 percent of people reported rolling on a condom inside out and then flipping it the other way around, potentially exposing their partner to bodily fluids.   7. Failing to unroll all the way: 11.2 percent of women and 8.8 percent of men had started intercourse before a condom was unrolled all the way.   8. Exposure to sharp objects: Between 2.1 percent and 11.2 percent of people had opened condom packets with sharp objects or otherwise exposed the latex to tearing.   9. Not checking for damage: Meanwhile, 82.7 percent of women and 74.5 percent of men failed to check condoms for damage before use.   10. No lubrication: Between 16 percent and 25.8 percent of participants had used condoms without lubrication, increasing the risk of a break.   11. Wrong lubrication: In about 4.1 percent of sexual events, people used oil-based lubrications with latex, which can degrade the condom. About 3.2 percent of women and 4.7 percent of men reported this error.   12. Incorrect withdrawal: Failing to promptly and properly withdraw after ejaculation was a common mistake, occurring in up to 57 percent of encounters in one study. About 31 percent of men and 27 percent of women reported this error.   13. Condom reuse: Between 1.4 percent and 3.3 percent of study respondents had re-used a condom at least twice during a sexual encounter.   14. Incorrect storage: Between 3.3 percent and 19.1 percent of people in the studies had stored condoms in conditions outside of the recommendations on the package.  While perfect condom use has a 98 percent success rate at preventing pregnancy, errors can increase the risk of breakage, slippage or other condom failure. Here are the rates for those problems:   Breakage: In various studies, between 0.8 percent and 40.7 percent of participants reported the experience of a broken condom. In some studies, the rates of sex with a broken condom were as high as 32.8 percent.   Slippage: Between 13.1 percent and 19.3 percent of participants reported condom slippage.

First, don't give up. Second, make sure you're using the right condoms the right way.    published 2015-02-23T16:30:00Z     We’ve all been there. Things are heating up and you both know exactly what you want to happen next. One of you whispers those five crucial words: “Do you have a condom?” and the other produces one (or, better still, several) triumphantly. You’re happily getting it on when you realize the condom tore or slipped off…  Condoms are easy, cheap, and offer protection against STIs and accidental pregnancy. Here’s the thing—they only work if you use them the right way. To help you do that, we’ve teamed up with Melissa White, CEO and founder of Lucky Bloke , to tell you how to avoid the six most common condom problems.  1. Help—the condom broke!  The good news is there are many ways to reduce the chance of a condom breaking. If you find yourself dealing with a broken condom situation, here’s what to do.  What now? If you realize right away (before anyone has gotten close to climaxing) that the condom broke, you can throw out the broken condom and try another one. Before you start again though you should make sure there isn’t something wrong with your condoms. Are the packages intact? Are your condoms expired? Were they exposed to extreme heat or cold? If not, you can use a new condom and just watch out for breakage.  If there’s a possibility of preejaculate or ejaculate, the safest thing to do is take emergency contraception (EC) . You can take EC up to five days after you have unprotected sex but most kinds work better the sooner you take them. Here’s how to get some . You may also want to get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if you’re not sure of your partner’s status. (And remember, you definitely can’t tell if someone has an STI just by looking !)  So it doesn’t happen again: Condoms can work very well when you use them right. If you’ve had a condom break, here are a few things to check to make sure it doesn’t happen again.   Size. When someone repeatedly has experiences with condoms breaking, it may mean the condom is too small. This doesn’t always mean a guy requires a large condom, though. A different kind of standard (or medium) size may work.  Lube.  Using lube can make using a condom a lot more pleasurable. Pro-tip—apply a small amount of lube to the penis before applying the condom. (If you are using the proper size condom, this should not cause the condom to slip.) Use a generous application of lube to the outside.  Packaging. It’s important to make sure you’re opening the condom package carefully. We know you may be tempted to rip it open or use your teeth to get things going asap, but opening the package the wrong way can tear the condom.  Putting it on. To make sure you put the condom on correctly, be sure to pinch the tip while rolling it on. It’s important to leave room room for the finale!   2. Uh oh…looks like the condom leaked.  If you notice semen anywhere outside the condom during sex or after, it’s time to take extra steps to make sure you don’t get pregnant.  What now? Again, taking EC as soon as possible is the best way to reduce your risk of accidental pregnancy. Getting tested for STIs is a good idea if you don’t know your partner’s status.  So it doesn’t happen again: If a condom is leaking from the base it’s probably too big. This happens more often than one might think, as 35% of men require a smaller than standard condoms. Smaller condoms are rarely available at your local store but you can get them through websites like Lucky Bloke , Condomania , and Condom Jungle . By simply switching to a condom that fits properly you will avoid this situation in the future. If you’re using a standard condom, try small. If you’re using a large condom, try standard.  If the condom is leaking from the top or the middle, it could have a tear—see the section above on broken condoms.  3. The condom fell off…and got stuck!  This one can be scary, especially if you have trouble finding and retrieving the condom. Don’t panic.  What now? If the condom falls off, once again it’s time to take EC and go for STI testing. If it gets stuck inside you or your partner, here’s Cosmo ’s advice: “lie back, relax, and insert one or two fingers inside of you and try to pull it out” . Don’t panic if you have trouble getting the condom out—hopefully it will come out on its own after a bit. If it doesn’t, head to your health care provider to remove it.  So it doesn’t happen again: This is another situation where the condom is probably too big—try a smaller size.  4. The condom doesn’t feel good and he can’t get hard.  If a condom is too tight or uncomfortable, he can lose his erection. It’s not you, it’s the condom, so don’t feel embarrassed—you can still save the night!  What now? There’s always the classic midnight condom run to get a different kind of condom, but if that’s not an option, opt for a cuddle and a movie and next time you hang out, come prepared.  So it doesn’t happen again: Again, it’s all about the fit. Even if a condom is not too tight, sometimes the fit is just uncomfortable. A good way to avoid this is to try out different kinds of condoms. (We like the sound of that!) Lucky Bloke has a “Not Sure What Size to Buy” condom sampler if you think size could be the issue. They also offer lots of other samplers if you just want to explore your options. You can also get variety packs through a bunch of other online retailers like Amazon , Condom Jungle , Sustain , and Condomania .  5. I think we’re allergic to condoms…  If you’re getting down and dirty and one of you starts getting itchy and irritated, it may be an allergic reaction to the condom you’re using.  What now? Give it a rest for the time-being and ditch the condom you’re using—no one wants to feel irritated! Go see your health care provider to find out what’s going on down there.  So it doesn’t happen again: If you’re allergic to latex, there are some great alternatives out there that protect from STIs and pregnancy and offer amazing sensitivity, heightened feeling, and heat transfer. Note that lambskin condoms, while in the non-latex category, are not ideal for everyone since they protect against pregnancy but not against STIs like HIV. Other non-latex condoms provide dual protection from pregnancy and STIs.  6. But won’t this cling wrap do the same thing?  Everybody knows someone who knows someone who used a plastic bag that one time. This is not a good idea . It seems like a no-brainer, but if you are turned on and can’t find a condom anywhere, cling wrap starts to sound more appealing. If you find yourself facing a spontaneous decision about whether to use anything for a condom other than a real condom , here’s what to do.  What now: Stop right there. Any material other than an actual condom will not work to prevent pregnancy and protect you from STIs. Go on a spontaneous condom run—you’d be surprised where you can find condoms !  So it doesn’t happen again: Your best bet for preventing this problem in the future is to carry condoms with you. They’re easy to tuck away into pockets and purses and it’s sexy to be prepared. Just make sure you don’t keep them too long in a pocket or purse or expose them to extreme temperatures.  What we’ve learned…  Most of these mishaps could be avoided by using the proper size condom. If your partner needs a snugger-fit condom, you might feel uncomfortable about approaching the subject. “I’d always suggest focusing on the pleasure aspect—you both will benefit.” says Melissa. “If you are using a condom that fits, your focus will be on each other and not on the condom.”  If you are having condom woes, a better fit condom—or a higher-quality condom—is going to be the solution in most cases.

That **** pretty much shredded and this was only after about 15 minutes. Something didnt feel right so I pulled out and bam, half the ****er is missing.                    08-01-2011, 12:12 PM    #9        vaako12     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Old Villian       Join Date: Nov 2007  Age: 27  Posts: 345  Rep Power: 1293                                 Originally Posted by freshspam1    If its a regular slam, tell her to get some BC, if its a rando, who cares.

Before this week i have never had a condom break in my life. One broke saturday night. She took plan b, about an hour aftet she took the second pill we went at it and again the condom broke. Im like wtf??? Same brand (durex) i always use. Not using anymore out of this box. Not expired either. I cant explain why it happens but i guess it does sometimes.  Luckly, she didnt need another plan b since the second one broke only an hour after taking it.

Its the friction from the girl that makes it break.                    08-01-2011, 07:25 PM    #12        Dave1958     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Registered User       Join Date: May 2007  Age: 59  Posts: 994  Rep Power: 814                           Lube is your friend. Even in prelubed brands, put a drop inside and however much you want outside. The main times I broke mine, before my vasectomy, I didn't leave enough room at the tip.                    08-01-2011, 07:30 PM    #13        DreamUFC88     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Registered User       Join Date: Jan 2011  Location: Washington, United States  Age: 29  Posts: 767  Rep Power: 2462                           For those of you that don't remember to squeeze the air out of the tip, that could be a big reason its breaking.

This one, right here.  You don't leave air in the tip to catch your baby juice... Gotta pinch the air OUT. Most of the time the tip will burst, and the rest will shred from the friction... Which leads to: keep 'em wet.

No breaking or slippage so far with a year of total active sex life. plenty of lube and squeeze air out of the tip, simple as that.                    08-02-2011, 10:41 PM    #16        Bunpitsu     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Britisher       Join Date: Jan 2010  Location: United Kingdom (Great Britain)  Posts: 5,378  Rep Power: 3805                           Never had a condom break in my life thus far. I'd chalk the vast majority of breakages up to;  1) Lack of application (not squeezing the tip, etc)  2) Using lubricant with the condom (if she's wet, it isn't even necessary. If she asks for it; you can't turn her on)  3) You are a phaggot  As for condoms slipping off, I've never experienced that either. I'm average in length, yet slightly thicker in girth. I can only imagine guys who experience slipping frequently have dicks like fast-food straws.                    08-02-2011, 11:22 PM    #17        AgRyan     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Bangarang.

Tiffanie Davis Henry, PhD    Psychology         It is possible for a condom to break during sex, but generally not due to manufacturer defect but more likely "user error."  It is safe to assume that condoms have been tested for quality prior to leaving the factory and that they are highly effective in protecting us against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  While nothing is 100% fool-proof, there are a few things that you can do to ensure you have the best condom experience.  To minimize the chances of your condom breaking, follow these 6 simple steps: Use The Right Lube - While many condoms come pre-lubricated, you may want to use your own.  That's perfectly fine.  Be sure that your lube choice is not oil-based (baby oil, vaseline, olive oil, etc.) as they can break down the integrity of the condom, causing it to thin out and break. Put It On Properly - Condoms should be placed on the top of the penis (like a little sombrero), squeezing the tip-like reservoir and gently rolled down to cover.  Squeezing the tip before rolling it down insures that you don't have excess air inside the condom, reducing the chance for breakage. Check The Expiration Date - Pretty much self explanatory but if the date on your condom wrapper or box has expired, it's best to throw it out and get new ones. Get The Right Fit - Condoms come in different sizes. Make sure you find a brand and size that fits securely, no gaps, but isn't too tight.  Too snug can burst.  Too loose can leak. Keep Away From Heat - Your wallet and the glove compartment of your car are no place for condom storage.  Be sure to store your unused condoms in a cool, dry, dark place (a drawer in your night stand, your naughty toy box, etc.) so that they're good to go when you are. No Teeth - Always open your condom wrapper with your fingers.  NEVER use your teeth or scissors to open.  Doing so increases your risk of tearing or puncturing the condom.                   Boston Women's Health Book Collective    Administration         A small percentage of condoms do break during sex. When they are used correctly, however, this rarely happens. Condoms are more likely to break if there is a lack of lubrication, so use a water-based lubricant to avoid this. Polyurethane condoms are more likely to break than latex ones.
