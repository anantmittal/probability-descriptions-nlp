   What Are The Odds Of Being Born On A Leap Year? It's About As Rare As You'd Think By Claire Warner Feb 28 2016 As your Facebook feed has no doubt made you aware, Feb. 29 is just around the corner, and there's one thing on everyone's minds: What are the odds of being born on a leap year? Most people find leaplings, as they're called by local-interest pieces and adoring grandmothers, inexplicably fascinating out of a perception that leap year birthdays are incredibly rare. But popular opinion is rarely 100 percent correct (see: every myth about the menstrual cycle ever). Are your chances of being born on a leap year actually that low? For once, the general public has the right idea, because the odds of a leap year birthday are usually estimated to be one in 1,461 . The statistics behind the number are surprisingly simple: Four years is equal to 1,460 days, and the leap year rounds it up to 1,461. Assuming the odds of being born are the same for every day, your chances of being a leapling turn out to be one in 1,461. That being said, it's not that rare; for example, your odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime are one in 3,000 , and your chances of becoming POTUS are one in 10,000,000. By comparison, being born on a leap year seems like no biggie. However, as the BBC points out, this may oversimplify things; it's well-known that human births vary based on season and location . A 2014 study found that peak birth months occur earlier in the year the further you get from the equator, and the Centers for Disease Control suggest that August is the most popular birth month in America. So in reality, your chances are probably a little less than the statistic cited above, but there's little specific research on the subject. Leap years are used as a way to reconcile the Earth's imperfect orbit with the Gregorian calendar used in most Western countries. Our calendar has 365 days, but the planet actually takes 365.24 days to go around the Sun. The disparity may not seem like much, but the extra time can (and did) build up over the course of centuries unless you account for it. When Julius Caesar came into power, the calendar was something of a mess, as the priesthood hadn't done a great job of keeping up with the convoluted system of the time. Caesar ordered the astronomer Sosigenes to create a new calendar, and he came up with 365-day system that tacked on an extra day every four years. This was later fine-tuned by Pope Gregorious XIII , and voila! You have the Gregorian calendar we still use today. If you were born on a leap year and find yourself so over all the "technically you're still a kid, har har!" jokes, you know who to blame. Thanks, Pope Gregorious XIII.

Of those days, February 29 occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is $485/730485=0.0006639424$"     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 29 '16 at 18:11             answered Feb 29 '16 at 7:35       StatsStudent   4,112 3 18 35              9      Why it cant be calculated  as 1/(Number of days in 4 years) = 1/1461 = 0.00068 ? – Siddhesh  Feb 29 '16 at 8:42         20      @Siddhesh There is a rule regarding the centuries.

An average year length is actually, on average, 365.2425 days not 365.25.  As written on the wikipedia leap year page, "The Gregorian calendar . . . removes three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its leap cycle. This is done by removing February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.[3] The years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are common years." – StatsStudent  Feb 29 '16 at 9:09         10      I don't see why you need to consider 2000 years; leap years are on a 400 year cycle, so why not just reduce to "there are 97 leap years in 400 years"? – Philip Kendall  Feb 29 '16 at 12:27        7      Why should we consider such minor influences as "cancelled" leap days in century years not multiples of 400 but on the other hand not factor in external influences, such as almost all births being delayed past or introduced before the 29th of February, just to save the child from the inconvenience (or other reasons)? - At least here in Germany the probability for a birth to occur on any 29th of February is (estimated) nearly zero. – Alexander Kosubek  Feb 29 '16 at 13:02        |  show 15 more comments             up vote  23  down vote      To accurately predict that probability using statistics, it would be helpful to know where the birth took place.  This page http://chmullig.com/2012/06/births-by-day-of-year/ has a graph showing a subset of the number of births per day (multiplying the 29th by 4, which is incorrect, and undesirable for this question, but it also links to the original data and gives a rough indication of what you can expect) in the United States. I would assume that this curve doesn't hold true for other countries, and especially not for other continents. In particular the southern hemisphere and equatorial region may show a substantial derivation from these results - assuming that climate is a determining factor.  Furthermore, there's the issue of "elective birth" (touched upon by the authors of http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e002920.full ) - in poorer regions of the globe, I would expect a different distribution of births, simply because (non-emergency-) cesarian sections or induced birth are rarer than in developed countries. This skews the final distribution of births.  Using the American data, assuming ~71 Million births (rough graphed mean * 366) and 46.000 births on February 29ths, not correcting for the distribution of leap years in the data, because the precise period is not indicated, I arrive at a probability of around ~0.000648. This is slightly below the value one would expect given a flat distribution of births, and thus in line with the general impression give by the graph.  I'll leave a significance test of this rough estimation to a motivated reader. But given that the 29th (though uncorrected - the year 2000 injects a below average bias into the data) scores low even for the already low February standards, I assume a relatively high confidence that the null-hypthosesis of equal distribution can be rejected.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 7:26             answered Feb 29 '16 at 13:17       Rick Moritz   331 1 4                  The data set has Feb 30 and 31 dates of birth.

Any theoretical answer would be flawed without accounting birthday selection phenomena, seasonality etc. These things are impossible to deal with theoretically.  The birthday data is hard to find in US for privacy reasons. There's one anonymous data set here . It's from insurance applications in USA. The difference from other reports, such as a popular often cited NYT article , is that it lists the frequency of births by date, instead of simple ranking of days in a year. The weak point is of course the sampling bias, since it comes from insurance: uninsured people are not included etc.  According to the data there were 325 births in Feb 29 of total 481040. According to the Roy Murphy , the sample spans from 1981 through 1994. It includes 3 leap years of total 14 years. Without any adjustments the probability would be 0.0675% of being born on Feb 29 between 1981 and 1994.  You can adjust the probability by accounting for the frequency of leap years, which is close to 1/4 ( not exactly though ), e.g. by multiplying this number by $14/12$ to arrive to 0.079% estimate. Here, the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 in a leap year is linked to the observed frequency $F_o=325$ by the frequency $f_L=3$ of leap years in a sample:
$$F_o=f_L/N\cdot F\cdot p,$$
where $N=14$ is the number of years in a sample, and $F=481040$ is the total frequency of births.  Normally, the probability of leap years is $p_L\approx 1/4$, hence, the long run average probability $P_L$ of being born on Feb 29 is:
$$P_L=p_L\cdot p\approx \frac{p_L\cdot N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F} \approx 0.079\%$$  You might be interested in the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 given that you were born on leap year:
$$p= \frac{N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F}\approx 0.32\%$$  So, the link between $P_L$ and $p$ is based on some couple of assumptions, e.g. that the probability of being born in any given year is uniform, and doesn't change.  Of course, this discussion was US centric. Who knows what are the patterns in other countries.  UPDATE: We automatically assumed that OP is Gregorian calendar. It gets even more interesting if you consider different calendars such as lunar calendar Hijri , where the leap years are every 30 years or so.  UPDATE 2:  What's surprising is that estimated probability $p$ leads to the expected occurrence of birthdays in Feb 29 for this sample: $F\cdot p=1,527$. This is only lower than Jan 1 and Dec 25, which is consistent with NYT's ranking above! They don't describe the source of data, referring to only Amitabh Chandra, Harvard University , but it's either the same or the finding is robust.  Now, how likely it is that very peculiar days in Gregorian calendar: Jan 1, Dec 25 and Deb 29 would come randomly as the most popular birthdays? I say it's highly unlikely a random occurrence. Hence, it's even more interesting to see what's going on in other calendars such as Hijri.  UPDATE 3:  Note that both $P_L,p$ are higher than naive theoretical estimates:  $$\hat p\approx 1/366\approx 0.27%$$
$$\hat P_L\approx p\cdot\frac{366}{365*4+1}\approx 0.068%$$  UPDATE 4:  Ben Millwood made comment that the distribution of births by day of year is non-uniform. Can we test this statement? Using my data set we can run $\chi^2$ test on the theoretical distribution with a null hypothesis that the distribution is uniform. The result is the rejection, i.e. the distribution doesn't seem to be uniform.  The theoretical distribution is built like this. We assume that the birth frequency is uniform across all calendar days, i.e. in 14 years span across $14*365+3$ days. Then we roll up the days into days of year, which is 366. Obviously only 3 leap days were encountered and 14 non-leap days. Below is my MATLAB code and the distribution plot for comparison of theoretical and empiricals.  d=[0101 1482

For instance, you have a web site and want to flag problematic user data. You could compare the frequency of Feb 29 birthdays with my probabilities. However, if you are planning a family and asking this question, then my numbers are useless, pretty much. The reason is that they don't account for factors such as when exactly the couple is actually copulating or fertility and period patterns of couples, for instance, which is the main determinant of the birth day date. – Aksakal  Feb 29 '16 at 16:53            Glad to see you did not start with the math before considering other factors, beyond pure stats – TheBlastOne  Mar 1 '16 at 7:02        add a comment |             up vote  8  down vote      The cover to my favorite book ever provides some highly relevant evidence against the assumption of a uniform allocation of births to dates. Specifically that births in the US since 1970 exhibit several trends superimposed on eachother: a long, multi-decade trend, a non-periodic trend, day-of-week trends, day-of-year trends, holiday trends (because procedures like Cesarean section allow one to effectively schedule the birthdate, and doctors often don't do those on holidays). The result is that the probability of being born on a randomly-chosen day in a year is not uniform, and because birth rate varies between years, not all years are equally likely, either. So the answer that just checks how many leap years there are in some interval and reckons from the calendar is making very strong assumptions which have little utility in describing the real world in any reasonable way!  This also provides evidence that Asksal's solution, while a very strong contender, is also incomplete. A small number of leap days will be "contaminated" by all off the effects at play here, so Asksal's estimate is also capturing (quite by accident) the effect of day-of-week and long-term trends along with the Feb. 29 effect. Which effects are and are not appropriate to include are not clearly defined by your question.  And this analysis only has bearing on the US, which has demographic trends which might be quite different from other nations or populations. Japan's birth rate has been declining for decades, for example. China's birth rate is regulated by the state, with some consequences for its nation's gender composition and hence birth rates in subsequent generations.  Likewise, Gelman's analysis only describes several recent decades, and it's not necessarily clear that this is even the era of interest to your question.   For those who get excited about this kind of thing, the material in the cover is discussed at length in the chapter on Gaussian processes.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 20:37       whuber ♦   188k 28 399 739        answered Mar 1 '16 at 13:50       Sycorax   25.5k 5 70 110              2      A brief description of the model used in also available in the blog post here: andrewgelman.com/2012/06/19/… – Sakari Cajanus  Mar 2 '16 at 14:15        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      February 29th is a date that occurs each year that is a multiple of 4 .  However years that are a multiple of 100 but aren't one of 400, are not considered as leap years (E.g: 1900 is not a leap year while 2000 or 1600 are). Therefore, nowadays, it is the same pattern every 400 years.  So let's do the maths on a [0;400[ interval:  On a 400 years period, there is exactly 4 x 25 = 100 years that are a multiple of 4 . But we have to subtract 3 (years multiple of 100 but not of 400) from 100, and we get 100 - 3 = 97 Now we have to multiply 97 by 366 , 97 x 366 = 35502 (365 x (400-97)) = 110 595 Then we just have to add these two numbers in order to know the total number of days in a 400 years period: 110 595 + 35502 = 146 097 To finish, our probability is the number of February 29th in a 400 years period so 97 given that there is 97 leap years divided by the total number of days of our interval: p = 97 / 146097 ≈ 0,0006639424492 Hope this is right and clear.   share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 29 '16 at 15:23       Jonathan Poid   31 1            7      This is a nice analysis of the chance that a randomly chosen date would be February 29th.  I believe most of the discussion in this thread focuses on the fact that this doesn't actually answer questions about chances of births, which do not really behave like random draws from the set of possible days. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 15:28        1      A much easier way is to say that there are 97 leap years per 400 years the way you have already worked out. Calculate the number of days in 400 normal years. 400 * 365 = 146000. Then you need to add the 97 leap days giving 146097. – CJ Dennis  Mar 1 '16 at 7:06        add a comment |         up vote  2  down vote      I believe there are two questions being mixed up here. The one is "What is the probability of any given day being a Feb. 29th?". The second one is (and the one actually asked) "What is the probability of being born on a leap day?"  The approach of simply counting days seems to be misleading as Aksakal is pointing it. Counting days and calculating frequencies of Feb. 29th occuring addresses the question: "What is the probability that any given day is a Feb. 29th?" (Imagine waking up after a coma, no clue what day it is. The probability of it being a Feb. 29th is as pointed out above $p = \frac{97}{146097}\approx 0,00066394$).  Following Aksakal's answer, the probability can just be based on empirical studies of the distribution of births across the days of the year. Different data sets will come to different conclusions (e.g. due to effects of seasonality, long-term trends in birth rates, cultural differences). Aksakal pointed out a study (One comment: to account for the unrepresentative occurence of a leap year in the mentioned data (i.e. $\frac{3}{14}$) compared to the long-term frequency of leap year occurences (i.e. $\frac{97}{400}$) you would have to multiply the frequency of birth on Feb. 29th from the sample by $\frac{97}{400}\cdot\frac{14}{3} = \frac{679}{600} \approx 1.131667$).  Finally, there is a third possible interpretation of the question, which I believe was not intended though: "What is the probability of a specific person being born on a leap day?" Well, for anyone already born that is easy. It is either $0$ or $1$. For anyone not born but already conceived it also can be estimated using empirical studies on the length of pregnancy (see Wikipedia for an overview ). For anyone not conceived yet, see above.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 8:20       mpiktas   27.7k 4 62 121        answered Feb 29 '16 at 16:32       data_enthusiast   34 4              2      Errr, I was ready to vote this up, and then I got to Well, for anyone already born that is easy.

I looked at it and know the outcome (e.g. heads). You are standing next to me, but have not seen the outcome. What is the probability of the coin showing heads (for you, for me, "objectively")? In the example above: for the given (born) person the probability is either 0 or 1 (assuming he knows on which date he is born). If you pick a person at random and you had to guess his birthday, the probability it being a Feb. 29 is than again an empirical question. – data_enthusiast  Mar 3 '16 at 8:53         add a comment |           up vote  1  down vote      I've noticed that most of the answers above work this out by calculating the number of leap days in a particular period. There is a simpler way to get the answer, 100% accurately, by definition:  We use leap years to adjust the regular (365 day) calendar to the mean tropical year (aka mean solar year). The mean tropical year "is the time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth" (Wikipedia). The tropical year varies slightly, but the mean (average) tropical year is ABOUT 365.24667.  If out leap days are correct, then the chance of a randomly selected day being a leap day, is ((tropical year) - (non-leap-year)) / tropical year  Pluging in the approximate number we have, it's (365.24667-365)/365.24667, or 0.24667/365.24667, or 675 per million (0.0675%).  This, however, is for a randomly selected day. I imagine that this is substantially skewed by parents who would rather not have to explain to their kids, "your actual birthday only comes once per 4 years".     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 1 '16 at 21:51       AMADANON Inc.   111 2              2      I don't think this answers the question being asked, because the leap day, Feb. 29, only exists in particular calendar systems. Those calendar systems have only been in use in particular societies during the recent historical eras. For example, this question is not intelligible to someone who reckons time using the Hebrew calendar, which has no "February" at all! Moreover, even if we assume a calendar with a leap day, it still doesn't resolve the indeterminacy surrounding the probability distribution of births to days. – Sycorax  Mar 1 '16 at 22:25            @user777, thats irrelevant.

The point is the Gregorian calendar exists today and it can be used to place every single day in history, whether or not they observed it at that time. – Octopus  Mar 2 '16 at 18:27            @Octopus How do you know that's the point? – Sycorax  Mar 2 '16 at 18:43         add a comment |           up vote  -4  down vote      I asked my sister, whose bithday is February 29, and she said, "The result of my own empirical study was that it is 1.00, obviously."     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 2 '16 at 20:57       Michael Kupietz   99                  Well, it seems that wasn't appreciated.

If you ask two people what month they were born in, and they respond February, what is the chance that they will have the same birthday? I was talking through this problem with a friend of mine, and we thought the chance was 1/(28.25^2), due to the expected number of days in but we're not completely sure. To make the problem complete, all normal leap year operations are true, ie every 4 years except multiples of 100, but yes to multiples of 4&100 (400).    probability     share | cite | improve this question      edited Jul 24 '15 at 2:33             asked Jul 24 '15 at 2:17       diminishedprime   11 2                  Forgetting the complication involving February 29, you shouldn't square.  The first person can be any date...there is then a (roughly) $\frac {1}{28.25}$ chance the second one matches.  As to leap years, happily 2000 was one, so I think it's reasonable to treat it as .25 of a day. – lulu  Jul 24 '15 at 2:26            Oh, I see. That makes sense.

I will make four cases:  Case1:Both born in a year with February with 28 day. this year has the probability 3/4  Hence we have the set which present their birthday day $\{(1,1) , (1, 2) , \cdots (28 , 28)\}$ This set has $28 \cdot 28$ days and $28$ element with same coordinates. This case has the probability ${9 \over 16}$. So to have the same birthday day we get $\frac{28}{28\cdot 28} \times \frac{9}{16}$.  Case 2 : A born in a 28 Feb year. B in a 29 Feb year. This has the probability ${3\over 16}$ again we make the set $\{ (1,1) , \cdots , (28,28), (1, 29) ,\cdots , (28 , 29)\}$ This set has $28\cdot 29$ elements with $28$ element with similar coordinates hence we have the probability $\frac{3}{16} \times \frac{28}{28 \cdot 29}$.  Case 3: A in 29 , B in 28 Feb year. This has a similar probability for case 2.  Case4: A and B in a year with 29 day in Feb. This will have the probability $\frac{1}{16} \times \frac{29}{29 \cdot 29}$  Thus the probability is the sum if the cases. 
$ \frac{9}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{28} + 2 \left(\frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{29} \right)+ \frac{1}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{29}$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jul 24 '15 at 7:33       AmerYR   443 2 11              2      People are more likely to be born in a leap year (366/365 more likely). – Michael  Jul 24 '15 at 8:20            I guess my mistake is I calculated the probability to have same day and month without the same year.

This Visualization Might Surprise You  By Matt Stiles  |  September 17, 2016 October 2, 2017  Matt Stiles  | Topics: Demographics     It’s baby season in America, with September the busiest month for births on average in the last two decades. So it seemed like the right time to remix this blog’s most-popular post: How Common is Your Birthday ?  That old heatmap , which highlighted specific dates for popularity, has been viewed more than 500,000 times here and published across the web. But it was flawed, namely that it used ordinal data (birthday ranks by date) rather than continuous data (actual births counts by date). This graphic finally addresses that problem:   This new version of the heatmap, which is interactive on larger screens, uses births by day from 1994 to 2014, thanks for the fine folks at FiveThirtyEight , whose reporters posted the tables on Github for an unrelated project . It lists the average number of births by day, the rank (number one is most common) and an estimated — if slightly irresponsible — conception date.  Some highlights:   Holidays: People generally seem to have time for baby making during their time off. Several of the most-common birth dates, in September, correspond with average conception periods around Christmas. Sept. 9 is most-common in this dataset, though other days in that month are close. Sept. 19 is second. Following a customary gestation period, many of these babies would, in theory, have been conceived on Dec. 17 and 27, respectively.   Choice: Clearly, some people choose when they have their children. While they’re making babies during the holidays, many people aren’t really having them then. The least-common birthdays in this dataset were Christmas Eve, Christmas and New Year’s Day. Dates around Thanksgiving aren’t as common. July 4 is also at the bottom of the list. Conversely, Valentine’s Day ranks relatively high, as you can see in the graphic, as are the days just before a new tax year begins.   Skewed: There are some fun patterns in this data, but the difference between your birthday — unless it’s on a truly rare day — isn’t that much different than a top date in September. There a left-tailed skewness to the data, which ranges from 6,500 births per day to more than 12,000. The median number of births per day, though, is around 11,000. The most-common day had 12,300 births, on average. More on the data distribution soon .    You can have a look at the data for yourself in this table:   Chances are you came here looking for the legacy birthday graphic. If you must, find it here , along with a related post about the flawed methodology.  Meanwhile, check out your birthday, share your thoughts in the comments — and tell the Internet to do the same.  Credits: Thanks, Cynthia Brewer, for your wonderful color guide . After trying several of your sample palettes, I couldn’t decide. So my three-year-old daughter — who celebrates a birthday Sept. 22 — chose this one. It looked the most like a birthday cake, she said. Also, thanks to publicdomainpictures.net for the cake image.

I was unfortunate enough to have been told the actual day of my conception, and the chart says I should have been conceived just the day before. Given all the variables in play, one day off is incredibly accurate.             Roberto Alicea    February 2, 2017 at 9:34 pm  Reply    Seems just about right.             Kevin Zheng    February 6, 2017 at 8:19 pm  Reply    The data is still somewhat biased because of the irregular sample size. In order to have completely unbiased data you need to have a number of samples such that each day falls on a particular day of the week the same number of times as any other day.  By looking at the graph there are clear spikes on April 4, 11, and 18. We know this is a cause of this bias because:  For example, the day April 11th, from 1994-2014, falls on: Monday 3 times (1994, 2005, 2011) Tuesday 3 times (1995, 2000, 2006) Wednesday 3 times (2001, 2007, 2012) Thursday 3 times (1996, 2002, 2013) Friday 3 times (1997, 2003, 2008, 2014) Saturday 2 times (1998, 2009) Sunday 3 times (1999, 2004, 2010)  It has more occurrences on a Friday and less occurrences on a Saturday compared to the other days of the week. Because of other studies showing that weekend birthdays are less common than weekday ones, we can conclude that the lowered frequency of weekend dates for the days April 4, 11, and 18 are causing a spike.  In order to have unbiased data you need a sample size of a 28-year span (e.g: 1989-2016) in which each day of the year falls on each day of the week exactly 4 times, expect Feb. 29 in which it falls on each day of the week exactly once.

Far fewer people are born on February 29 than on any other date, so I presume some kind of statistical adjustment has been made.

I have a classmate whose sister was born 9/11/2001               Cassey    July 5, 2017 at 10:01 pm  Reply    I’m surprised there is no mention of planned c-section, (and also to a lesser extent, inductions) being less likely to be planned for public holidays, weekends. Some women offered dates for planned c-section may be less likely to choose the 13th of the month, or Friday the 13th.  I also thought it was widely assumed that the increase of births in August September time is at least partially due to the ‘Christmas Spirit’ – Spending more time with loved ones, or Christmas Parties or/and drinking more alcohol causing ‘accidents’ with contraception or simply not using it.  As for the increase in births starts in June July time. I wonder if there is a corresponding increase in prescriptions of antibiotics in the Autumn and start of Winter? Some pregnancies occur as the mother’s contraceptive pill has been made ineffective by antibiotics, either because the couple didn’t know they needed to use additional contraception or because they forgot to.             Cassey    July 5, 2017 at 10:19 pm  Reply    It would be interesting to see the graphic split for planned c-sections, and another for all other births (vaginal delivery, emergency c-section, any induction).  Something else that might be interesting to know – is there a time of year where it is more likely for IVF (embryos to be  transferred back) and similar other fertility treatment to be carried out?  The resulting pregnancies have a higher chance of twins, and (in the UK at least) a higher chance of the mother being under consultant care rather than midwife/GP team. Being under consultant care it is more likely babies will be born by c-section.

I wonder how the data compares with natural births.             Fletus    October 2, 2017 at 8:01 pm  Reply    Yes, this is surprising, because with my friends group we hate november 20-25 because 12 of them (of 28) born on those dates. Five on 23.

Sharmama    January 2, 2018 at 4:59 pm  Reply    I have thought for some time that low birth rates for major holidays are due to lack of elective c sections. I think doctors and hospital staff would be difficult to arrange for Christmas day, Christmas eve, New year day, independence day. That seems obvious!             Liz    January 15, 2018 at 6:25 am  Reply    Would be nice to see the same data set charted to moon phase.  And to see if similar trends hold true in other countries.  Maybe it is an American quirk to abstain from birth during festive occasions.             D    January 16, 2018 at 8:16 pm  Reply    What incredible is that 2/29 is not the least likely birthday, even though it comes only once every four years. Also, Hospitals and mothers don’t want to birth babies on holidays.

By   Brian Hershberg    Brian Hershberg  The Wall Street Journal  Biography Brian Hershberg     Feb 29, 2016 1:17 pm  ET    This past week’s Numbers column on leap day included a box of facts that led a reader to write in about the accuracy of one tidbit–that the chance of being born naturally on Feb. 29 is roughly 1 in 1,461.  The reader suggested that since we omit three leap days every 400 years it would make the chance roughly 1 in 1,506.  Turns out there are several schools of thought on how to calculate the chances, including a vibrant debate here .

It's About As Rare As You'd Think By Claire Warner Feb 28 2016 As your Facebook feed has no doubt made you aware, Feb. 29 is just around the corner, and there's one thing on everyone's minds: What are the odds of being born on a leap year? Most people find leaplings, as they're called by local-interest pieces and adoring grandmothers, inexplicably fascinating out of a perception that leap year birthdays are incredibly rare. But popular opinion is rarely 100 percent correct (see: every myth about the menstrual cycle ever). Are your chances of being born on a leap year actually that low? For once, the general public has the right idea, because the odds of a leap year birthday are usually estimated to be one in 1,461 . The statistics behind the number are surprisingly simple: Four years is equal to 1,460 days, and the leap year rounds it up to 1,461. Assuming the odds of being born are the same for every day, your chances of being a leapling turn out to be one in 1,461. That being said, it's not that rare; for example, your odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime are one in 3,000 , and your chances of becoming POTUS are one in 10,000,000. By comparison, being born on a leap year seems like no biggie. However, as the BBC points out, this may oversimplify things; it's well-known that human births vary based on season and location . A 2014 study found that peak birth months occur earlier in the year the further you get from the equator, and the Centers for Disease Control suggest that August is the most popular birth month in America. So in reality, your chances are probably a little less than the statistic cited above, but there's little specific research on the subject. Leap years are used as a way to reconcile the Earth's imperfect orbit with the Gregorian calendar used in most Western countries. Our calendar has 365 days, but the planet actually takes 365.24 days to go around the Sun. The disparity may not seem like much, but the extra time can (and did) build up over the course of centuries unless you account for it. When Julius Caesar came into power, the calendar was something of a mess, as the priesthood hadn't done a great job of keeping up with the convoluted system of the time. Caesar ordered the astronomer Sosigenes to create a new calendar, and he came up with 365-day system that tacked on an extra day every four years. This was later fine-tuned by Pope Gregorious XIII , and voila! You have the Gregorian calendar we still use today. If you were born on a leap year and find yourself so over all the "technically you're still a kid, har har!" jokes, you know who to blame. Thanks, Pope Gregorious XIII.

All people in history? Today? All people alive? Prospectively into the future? Probabilities are meaningless unless the events to which they refer are well-defined. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 13:55        14      100% of the people born today will be. Does that help? – aslum  Feb 29 '16 at 14:08        8      Lots of parents don't want their kids to be born on leap day. So with the rise of scheduled C-sections, the probability will be lower than a random day. fivethirtyeight.com/features/… – James Lawruk  Feb 29 '16 at 17:11        2      I agree with @whuber, that the question is ill-defined. Without proper definition of probability space the question cannot be answered.

See here for a more detailed explanation: http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mlamias/LeapYear.pdf .  But essentially the author concludes, "There are 485 leap years in 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are $485(366) + (2000-485)(365)= 730485$ total days.  Of those days, February 29 occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is $485/730485=0.0006639424$"     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 29 '16 at 18:11             answered Feb 29 '16 at 7:35       StatsStudent   4,112 3 18 35              9      Why it cant be calculated  as 1/(Number of days in 4 years) = 1/1461 = 0.00068 ? – Siddhesh  Feb 29 '16 at 8:42         20      @Siddhesh There is a rule regarding the centuries.

An average year length is actually, on average, 365.2425 days not 365.25.  As written on the wikipedia leap year page, "The Gregorian calendar . . . removes three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its leap cycle. This is done by removing February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.[3] The years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are common years." – StatsStudent  Feb 29 '16 at 9:09         10      I don't see why you need to consider 2000 years; leap years are on a 400 year cycle, so why not just reduce to "there are 97 leap years in 400 years"? – Philip Kendall  Feb 29 '16 at 12:27        7      Why should we consider such minor influences as "cancelled" leap days in century years not multiples of 400 but on the other hand not factor in external influences, such as almost all births being delayed past or introduced before the 29th of February, just to save the child from the inconvenience (or other reasons)? - At least here in Germany the probability for a birth to occur on any 29th of February is (estimated) nearly zero. – Alexander Kosubek  Feb 29 '16 at 13:02        |  show 15 more comments             up vote  23  down vote      To accurately predict that probability using statistics, it would be helpful to know where the birth took place.  This page http://chmullig.com/2012/06/births-by-day-of-year/ has a graph showing a subset of the number of births per day (multiplying the 29th by 4, which is incorrect, and undesirable for this question, but it also links to the original data and gives a rough indication of what you can expect) in the United States. I would assume that this curve doesn't hold true for other countries, and especially not for other continents. In particular the southern hemisphere and equatorial region may show a substantial derivation from these results - assuming that climate is a determining factor.  Furthermore, there's the issue of "elective birth" (touched upon by the authors of http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e002920.full ) - in poorer regions of the globe, I would expect a different distribution of births, simply because (non-emergency-) cesarian sections or induced birth are rarer than in developed countries. This skews the final distribution of births.  Using the American data, assuming ~71 Million births (rough graphed mean * 366) and 46.000 births on February 29ths, not correcting for the distribution of leap years in the data, because the precise period is not indicated, I arrive at a probability of around ~0.000648. This is slightly below the value one would expect given a flat distribution of births, and thus in line with the general impression give by the graph.  I'll leave a significance test of this rough estimation to a motivated reader. But given that the 29th (though uncorrected - the year 2000 injects a below average bias into the data) scores low even for the already low February standards, I assume a relatively high confidence that the null-hypthosesis of equal distribution can be rejected.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 7:26             answered Feb 29 '16 at 13:17       Rick Moritz   331 1 4                  The data set has Feb 30 and 31 dates of birth.

Any theoretical answer would be flawed without accounting birthday selection phenomena, seasonality etc. These things are impossible to deal with theoretically.  The birthday data is hard to find in US for privacy reasons. There's one anonymous data set here . It's from insurance applications in USA. The difference from other reports, such as a popular often cited NYT article , is that it lists the frequency of births by date, instead of simple ranking of days in a year. The weak point is of course the sampling bias, since it comes from insurance: uninsured people are not included etc.  According to the data there were 325 births in Feb 29 of total 481040. According to the Roy Murphy , the sample spans from 1981 through 1994. It includes 3 leap years of total 14 years. Without any adjustments the probability would be 0.0675% of being born on Feb 29 between 1981 and 1994.  You can adjust the probability by accounting for the frequency of leap years, which is close to 1/4 ( not exactly though ), e.g. by multiplying this number by $14/12$ to arrive to 0.079% estimate. Here, the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 in a leap year is linked to the observed frequency $F_o=325$ by the frequency $f_L=3$ of leap years in a sample:
$$F_o=f_L/N\cdot F\cdot p,$$
where $N=14$ is the number of years in a sample, and $F=481040$ is the total frequency of births.  Normally, the probability of leap years is $p_L\approx 1/4$, hence, the long run average probability $P_L$ of being born on Feb 29 is:
$$P_L=p_L\cdot p\approx \frac{p_L\cdot N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F} \approx 0.079\%$$  You might be interested in the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 given that you were born on leap year:
$$p= \frac{N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F}\approx 0.32\%$$  So, the link between $P_L$ and $p$ is based on some couple of assumptions, e.g. that the probability of being born in any given year is uniform, and doesn't change.  Of course, this discussion was US centric. Who knows what are the patterns in other countries.  UPDATE: We automatically assumed that OP is Gregorian calendar. It gets even more interesting if you consider different calendars such as lunar calendar Hijri , where the leap years are every 30 years or so.  UPDATE 2:  What's surprising is that estimated probability $p$ leads to the expected occurrence of birthdays in Feb 29 for this sample: $F\cdot p=1,527$. This is only lower than Jan 1 and Dec 25, which is consistent with NYT's ranking above! They don't describe the source of data, referring to only Amitabh Chandra, Harvard University , but it's either the same or the finding is robust.  Now, how likely it is that very peculiar days in Gregorian calendar: Jan 1, Dec 25 and Deb 29 would come randomly as the most popular birthdays? I say it's highly unlikely a random occurrence. Hence, it's even more interesting to see what's going on in other calendars such as Hijri.  UPDATE 3:  Note that both $P_L,p$ are higher than naive theoretical estimates:  $$\hat p\approx 1/366\approx 0.27%$$
$$\hat P_L\approx p\cdot\frac{366}{365*4+1}\approx 0.068%$$  UPDATE 4:  Ben Millwood made comment that the distribution of births by day of year is non-uniform. Can we test this statement? Using my data set we can run $\chi^2$ test on the theoretical distribution with a null hypothesis that the distribution is uniform. The result is the rejection, i.e. the distribution doesn't seem to be uniform.  The theoretical distribution is built like this. We assume that the birth frequency is uniform across all calendar days, i.e. in 14 years span across $14*365+3$ days. Then we roll up the days into days of year, which is 366. Obviously only 3 leap days were encountered and 14 non-leap days. Below is my MATLAB code and the distribution plot for comparison of theoretical and empiricals.  d=[0101 1482

For instance, you have a web site and want to flag problematic user data. You could compare the frequency of Feb 29 birthdays with my probabilities. However, if you are planning a family and asking this question, then my numbers are useless, pretty much. The reason is that they don't account for factors such as when exactly the couple is actually copulating or fertility and period patterns of couples, for instance, which is the main determinant of the birth day date. – Aksakal  Feb 29 '16 at 16:53            Glad to see you did not start with the math before considering other factors, beyond pure stats – TheBlastOne  Mar 1 '16 at 7:02        add a comment |             up vote  8  down vote      The cover to my favorite book ever provides some highly relevant evidence against the assumption of a uniform allocation of births to dates. Specifically that births in the US since 1970 exhibit several trends superimposed on eachother: a long, multi-decade trend, a non-periodic trend, day-of-week trends, day-of-year trends, holiday trends (because procedures like Cesarean section allow one to effectively schedule the birthdate, and doctors often don't do those on holidays). The result is that the probability of being born on a randomly-chosen day in a year is not uniform, and because birth rate varies between years, not all years are equally likely, either. So the answer that just checks how many leap years there are in some interval and reckons from the calendar is making very strong assumptions which have little utility in describing the real world in any reasonable way!  This also provides evidence that Asksal's solution, while a very strong contender, is also incomplete. A small number of leap days will be "contaminated" by all off the effects at play here, so Asksal's estimate is also capturing (quite by accident) the effect of day-of-week and long-term trends along with the Feb. 29 effect. Which effects are and are not appropriate to include are not clearly defined by your question.  And this analysis only has bearing on the US, which has demographic trends which might be quite different from other nations or populations. Japan's birth rate has been declining for decades, for example. China's birth rate is regulated by the state, with some consequences for its nation's gender composition and hence birth rates in subsequent generations.  Likewise, Gelman's analysis only describes several recent decades, and it's not necessarily clear that this is even the era of interest to your question.   For those who get excited about this kind of thing, the material in the cover is discussed at length in the chapter on Gaussian processes.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 20:37       whuber ♦   188k 28 399 739        answered Mar 1 '16 at 13:50       Sycorax   25.5k 5 70 110              2      A brief description of the model used in also available in the blog post here: andrewgelman.com/2012/06/19/… – Sakari Cajanus  Mar 2 '16 at 14:15        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      February 29th is a date that occurs each year that is a multiple of 4 .  However years that are a multiple of 100 but aren't one of 400, are not considered as leap years (E.g: 1900 is not a leap year while 2000 or 1600 are). Therefore, nowadays, it is the same pattern every 400 years.  So let's do the maths on a [0;400[ interval:  On a 400 years period, there is exactly 4 x 25 = 100 years that are a multiple of 4 . But we have to subtract 3 (years multiple of 100 but not of 400) from 100, and we get 100 - 3 = 97 Now we have to multiply 97 by 366 , 97 x 366 = 35502 (365 x (400-97)) = 110 595 Then we just have to add these two numbers in order to know the total number of days in a 400 years period: 110 595 + 35502 = 146 097 To finish, our probability is the number of February 29th in a 400 years period so 97 given that there is 97 leap years divided by the total number of days of our interval: p = 97 / 146097 ≈ 0,0006639424492 Hope this is right and clear.   share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 29 '16 at 15:23       Jonathan Poid   31 1            7      This is a nice analysis of the chance that a randomly chosen date would be February 29th.  I believe most of the discussion in this thread focuses on the fact that this doesn't actually answer questions about chances of births, which do not really behave like random draws from the set of possible days. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 15:28        1      A much easier way is to say that there are 97 leap years per 400 years the way you have already worked out. Calculate the number of days in 400 normal years. 400 * 365 = 146000. Then you need to add the 97 leap days giving 146097. – CJ Dennis  Mar 1 '16 at 7:06        add a comment |         up vote  2  down vote      I believe there are two questions being mixed up here. The one is "What is the probability of any given day being a Feb. 29th?". The second one is (and the one actually asked) "What is the probability of being born on a leap day?"  The approach of simply counting days seems to be misleading as Aksakal is pointing it. Counting days and calculating frequencies of Feb. 29th occuring addresses the question: "What is the probability that any given day is a Feb. 29th?" (Imagine waking up after a coma, no clue what day it is. The probability of it being a Feb. 29th is as pointed out above $p = \frac{97}{146097}\approx 0,00066394$).  Following Aksakal's answer, the probability can just be based on empirical studies of the distribution of births across the days of the year. Different data sets will come to different conclusions (e.g. due to effects of seasonality, long-term trends in birth rates, cultural differences). Aksakal pointed out a study (One comment: to account for the unrepresentative occurence of a leap year in the mentioned data (i.e. $\frac{3}{14}$) compared to the long-term frequency of leap year occurences (i.e. $\frac{97}{400}$) you would have to multiply the frequency of birth on Feb. 29th from the sample by $\frac{97}{400}\cdot\frac{14}{3} = \frac{679}{600} \approx 1.131667$).  Finally, there is a third possible interpretation of the question, which I believe was not intended though: "What is the probability of a specific person being born on a leap day?" Well, for anyone already born that is easy. It is either $0$ or $1$. For anyone not born but already conceived it also can be estimated using empirical studies on the length of pregnancy (see Wikipedia for an overview ). For anyone not conceived yet, see above.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 8:20       mpiktas   27.7k 4 62 121        answered Feb 29 '16 at 16:32       data_enthusiast   34 4              2      Errr, I was ready to vote this up, and then I got to Well, for anyone already born that is easy.

I looked at it and know the outcome (e.g. heads). You are standing next to me, but have not seen the outcome. What is the probability of the coin showing heads (for you, for me, "objectively")? In the example above: for the given (born) person the probability is either 0 or 1 (assuming he knows on which date he is born). If you pick a person at random and you had to guess his birthday, the probability it being a Feb. 29 is than again an empirical question. – data_enthusiast  Mar 3 '16 at 8:53         add a comment |           up vote  1  down vote      I've noticed that most of the answers above work this out by calculating the number of leap days in a particular period. There is a simpler way to get the answer, 100% accurately, by definition:  We use leap years to adjust the regular (365 day) calendar to the mean tropical year (aka mean solar year). The mean tropical year "is the time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth" (Wikipedia). The tropical year varies slightly, but the mean (average) tropical year is ABOUT 365.24667.  If out leap days are correct, then the chance of a randomly selected day being a leap day, is ((tropical year) - (non-leap-year)) / tropical year  Pluging in the approximate number we have, it's (365.24667-365)/365.24667, or 0.24667/365.24667, or 675 per million (0.0675%).  This, however, is for a randomly selected day. I imagine that this is substantially skewed by parents who would rather not have to explain to their kids, "your actual birthday only comes once per 4 years".     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 1 '16 at 21:51       AMADANON Inc.   111 2              2      I don't think this answers the question being asked, because the leap day, Feb. 29, only exists in particular calendar systems. Those calendar systems have only been in use in particular societies during the recent historical eras. For example, this question is not intelligible to someone who reckons time using the Hebrew calendar, which has no "February" at all!

If you ask two people what month they were born in, and they respond February, what is the chance that they will have the same birthday? I was talking through this problem with a friend of mine, and we thought the chance was 1/(28.25^2), due to the expected number of days in but we're not completely sure. To make the problem complete, all normal leap year operations are true, ie every 4 years except multiples of 100, but yes to multiples of 4&100 (400).    probability     share | cite | improve this question      edited Jul 24 '15 at 2:33             asked Jul 24 '15 at 2:17       diminishedprime   11 2                  Forgetting the complication involving February 29, you shouldn't square.  The first person can be any date...there is then a (roughly) $\frac {1}{28.25}$ chance the second one matches.  As to leap years, happily 2000 was one, so I think it's reasonable to treat it as .25 of a day. – lulu  Jul 24 '15 at 2:26            Oh, I see. That makes sense.

I will make four cases:  Case1:Both born in a year with February with 28 day. this year has the probability 3/4  Hence we have the set which present their birthday day $\{(1,1) , (1, 2) , \cdots (28 , 28)\}$ This set has $28 \cdot 28$ days and $28$ element with same coordinates. This case has the probability ${9 \over 16}$. So to have the same birthday day we get $\frac{28}{28\cdot 28} \times \frac{9}{16}$.  Case 2 : A born in a 28 Feb year. B in a 29 Feb year. This has the probability ${3\over 16}$ again we make the set $\{ (1,1) , \cdots , (28,28), (1, 29) ,\cdots , (28 , 29)\}$ This set has $28\cdot 29$ elements with $28$ element with similar coordinates hence we have the probability $\frac{3}{16} \times \frac{28}{28 \cdot 29}$.  Case 3: A in 29 , B in 28 Feb year. This has a similar probability for case 2.  Case4: A and B in a year with 29 day in Feb. This will have the probability $\frac{1}{16} \times \frac{29}{29 \cdot 29}$  Thus the probability is the sum if the cases. 
$ \frac{9}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{28} + 2 \left(\frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{29} \right)+ \frac{1}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{29}$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jul 24 '15 at 7:33       AmerYR   443 2 11              2      People are more likely to be born in a leap year (366/365 more likely). – Michael  Jul 24 '15 at 8:20            I guess my mistake is I calculated the probability to have same day and month without the same year.

This Visualization Might Surprise You  By Matt Stiles  |  September 17, 2016 October 2, 2017  Matt Stiles  | Topics: Demographics     It’s baby season in America, with September the busiest month for births on average in the last two decades. So it seemed like the right time to remix this blog’s most-popular post: How Common is Your Birthday ?  That old heatmap , which highlighted specific dates for popularity, has been viewed more than 500,000 times here and published across the web. But it was flawed, namely that it used ordinal data (birthday ranks by date) rather than continuous data (actual births counts by date). This graphic finally addresses that problem:   This new version of the heatmap, which is interactive on larger screens, uses births by day from 1994 to 2014, thanks for the fine folks at FiveThirtyEight , whose reporters posted the tables on Github for an unrelated project . It lists the average number of births by day, the rank (number one is most common) and an estimated — if slightly irresponsible — conception date.  Some highlights:   Holidays: People generally seem to have time for baby making during their time off. Several of the most-common birth dates, in September, correspond with average conception periods around Christmas. Sept. 9 is most-common in this dataset, though other days in that month are close. Sept. 19 is second. Following a customary gestation period, many of these babies would, in theory, have been conceived on Dec. 17 and 27, respectively.   Choice: Clearly, some people choose when they have their children. While they’re making babies during the holidays, many people aren’t really having them then. The least-common birthdays in this dataset were Christmas Eve, Christmas and New Year’s Day. Dates around Thanksgiving aren’t as common. July 4 is also at the bottom of the list. Conversely, Valentine’s Day ranks relatively high, as you can see in the graphic, as are the days just before a new tax year begins.   Skewed: There are some fun patterns in this data, but the difference between your birthday — unless it’s on a truly rare day — isn’t that much different than a top date in September. There a left-tailed skewness to the data, which ranges from 6,500 births per day to more than 12,000. The median number of births per day, though, is around 11,000. The most-common day had 12,300 births, on average. More on the data distribution soon .    You can have a look at the data for yourself in this table:   Chances are you came here looking for the legacy birthday graphic. If you must, find it here , along with a related post about the flawed methodology.  Meanwhile, check out your birthday, share your thoughts in the comments — and tell the Internet to do the same.  Credits: Thanks, Cynthia Brewer, for your wonderful color guide . After trying several of your sample palettes, I couldn’t decide. So my three-year-old daughter — who celebrates a birthday Sept. 22 — chose this one. It looked the most like a birthday cake, she said. Also, thanks to publicdomainpictures.net for the cake image.

I was unfortunate enough to have been told the actual day of my conception, and the chart says I should have been conceived just the day before. Given all the variables in play, one day off is incredibly accurate.             Roberto Alicea    February 2, 2017 at 9:34 pm  Reply    Seems just about right.             Kevin Zheng    February 6, 2017 at 8:19 pm  Reply    The data is still somewhat biased because of the irregular sample size. In order to have completely unbiased data you need to have a number of samples such that each day falls on a particular day of the week the same number of times as any other day.  By looking at the graph there are clear spikes on April 4, 11, and 18. We know this is a cause of this bias because:  For example, the day April 11th, from 1994-2014, falls on: Monday 3 times (1994, 2005, 2011) Tuesday 3 times (1995, 2000, 2006) Wednesday 3 times (2001, 2007, 2012) Thursday 3 times (1996, 2002, 2013) Friday 3 times (1997, 2003, 2008, 2014) Saturday 2 times (1998, 2009) Sunday 3 times (1999, 2004, 2010)  It has more occurrences on a Friday and less occurrences on a Saturday compared to the other days of the week. Because of other studies showing that weekend birthdays are less common than weekday ones, we can conclude that the lowered frequency of weekend dates for the days April 4, 11, and 18 are causing a spike.  In order to have unbiased data you need a sample size of a 28-year span (e.g: 1989-2016) in which each day of the year falls on each day of the week exactly 4 times, expect Feb. 29 in which it falls on each day of the week exactly once.

A. J. Sharp    May 17, 2017 at 8:39 am  Reply    I’m not sure how February 29 is not last.  Is that controlled for somewhere to normalize that date against the others?  Far fewer people are born on February 29 than on any other date, so I presume some kind of statistical adjustment has been made.  I always tell people that I almost never meet anyone who shares my birthday, November 23.  Sure enough, it’s 359th!             Matt Stiles    May 18, 2017 at 11:00 am  Author  Reply    That’s a good question, and I honestly can’t remember whether I thought about it then.

I’ll bet money that day drops way off.             Creagh Roberson    September 22, 2017 at 10:04 pm  Reply    I think you’re right about! I have a classmate whose sister was born 9/11/2001               Cassey    July 5, 2017 at 10:01 pm  Reply    I’m surprised there is no mention of planned c-section, (and also to a lesser extent, inductions) being less likely to be planned for public holidays, weekends. Some women offered dates for planned c-section may be less likely to choose the 13th of the month, or Friday the 13th.  I also thought it was widely assumed that the increase of births in August September time is at least partially due to the ‘Christmas Spirit’ – Spending more time with loved ones, or Christmas Parties or/and drinking more alcohol causing ‘accidents’ with contraception or simply not using it.  As for the increase in births starts in June July time. I wonder if there is a corresponding increase in prescriptions of antibiotics in the Autumn and start of Winter? Some pregnancies occur as the mother’s contraceptive pill has been made ineffective by antibiotics, either because the couple didn’t know they needed to use additional contraception or because they forgot to.             Cassey    July 5, 2017 at 10:19 pm  Reply    It would be interesting to see the graphic split for planned c-sections, and another for all other births (vaginal delivery, emergency c-section, any induction).  Something else that might be interesting to know – is there a time of year where it is more likely for IVF (embryos to be  transferred back) and similar other fertility treatment to be carried out?  The resulting pregnancies have a higher chance of twins, and (in the UK at least) a higher chance of the mother being under consultant care rather than midwife/GP team. Being under consultant care it is more likely babies will be born by c-section.             Creagh Roberson    September 20, 2017 at 5:15 am  Reply    I was born on April 1, but it was in 1993, so if they could calculate the birthdays from 1990-2000, that would be great             Creagh Roberson    September 22, 2017 at 10:10 pm  Reply    I was born on April Fools Day, but it in 1993!             Bogdan Rădulescu    October 2, 2017 at 12:41 pm  Reply    There are 50% less births on Sundays:  https://docs.google.com/a/nimblex.org/spreadsheets/d/1WhpO_C4i-apoBpl3MVYlk1D6Fx0yl_Jh5ZgnNk0FB4A/edit?usp=sharing  C-section definitely must be a factor. I wonder how the data compares with natural births.             Fletus    October 2, 2017 at 8:01 pm  Reply    Yes, this is surprising, because with my friends group we hate november 20-25 because 12 of them (of 28) born on those dates. Five on 23.             Creagh Alexandria Roberson    December 2, 2017 at 7:42 am  Reply    were you born in 93 also?             Sharmama    January 2, 2018 at 4:59 pm  Reply    I have thought for some time that low birth rates for major holidays are due to lack of elective c sections. I think doctors and hospital staff would be difficult to arrange for Christmas day, Christmas eve, New year day, independence day. That seems obvious!             Liz    January 15, 2018 at 6:25 am  Reply    Would be nice to see the same data set charted to moon phase.  And to see if similar trends hold true in other countries.  Maybe it is an American quirk to abstain from birth during festive occasions.             D    January 16, 2018 at 8:16 pm  Reply    What incredible is that 2/29 is not the least likely birthday, even though it comes only once every four years. Also, Hospitals and mothers don’t want to birth babies on holidays.
