Mark Wilson / Getty Images   Jury chairs sit empty inside the courtroom of the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Mark Wilson / Getty Images      Dear Mona,  How many Americans serve as jurors in an actual trial in their lifetimes? I’m asking because I was just picked to serve in a jury trial for the third time. Most people I know have never had to sit through a trial as a juror. They may have been called for jury duty, but they were usually dismissed the same day. Am I some sort of an exception?  Andrew, 45, Connecticut   Dear Andrew,  In a 2012 survey, 27 percent of U.S. adults said they had served on a jury at some point in their lives. That survey was conducted by DRI, a membership organization for defense lawyers, and was based on only 1,020 interviews — but it’s the best source I can find to answer your question about lifetime jury service. To get more detailed national numbers, I’m going to have to zoom in on a shorter timeframe.  The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) estimates that in a given year, 32 million people get summoned for service — though only 8 million of them actually report for jury duty (there are lots of reasons for that difference, including the 4 million summonses returned by the post office marked as undeliverable and the 3 million people who fail to appear). It’s estimated that only 1.5 million people are eventually selected to serve on a jury in a state court each year. Those numbers, the most recent available, come from a 2007 survey conducted by the NCSC.  NCSC analyst Greg Hurley explained to me that while federal courts are under a unified system that makes data collection pretty easy, “state courts are a different bird.” Their sheer number (there are more than 3,000 U.S. counties, and almost every one has a court), as well as their differing practices in jury selection, makes it impossible to collect state-court-level data without time-consuming and expensive surveys. So, to get more recent and more detailed data, I’m going to have to look at the federal courts. Which is a shame because that data represents a small fraction of all U.S. adults’ experiences of jury service.  Last year, almost 64,000 people were selected for federal jury service in the U.S. — that’s only 0.03 percent of the adult population. If you want to understand the probability of getting selected, you have to use the adult population as your baseline because you have to be at least 18 to serve on a U.S. jury. That’s not the only condition for jury service , though — in fact, the pool of people from which juries can be drawn is considerably smaller than the 238 million adults in America.  To be legally qualified for federal jury service, you also have to be a U.S. citizen, which, according to 2013 estimates from the Census Bureau, brings the number of potential federal jurors down to 218 million adults. Another condition for serving is that, with some exceptions, you can’t have been convicted of a felony — which as of 2010 ruled out about 6 million adults, taking us to 212 million.  And, if your English isn’t proficient enough to satisfactorily complete the juror qualification form, you can’t serve, either — that could affect some of the nearly one in 10 working-age U.S. adults who in 2012 were considered “limited English proficient.” 1  There are even more criteria to be legally qualified for federal jury service than we can get into here — and they’re even more complex to quantify. 2 So I don’t know the number of people who are eligible to be jurors in the U.S., and without that number, I can’t really give you an accurate probability about your chances of getting selected. Please try to keep that in mind as you read on.  Let’s go back for a minute to the number of people who were selected for federal jury service last year. In the 12 months through September 2014, 48,877 adults served in trial juries, according to caseload statistics from the U.S. federal court system. Another estimated 14,879 adults served in grand juries over that period. In the case of grand juries , the federal courts track only the number of grand juries (763 last year) and the number of times jurors report to them (164,856 last year — meaning one juror that attends on five days is counted five times). So to figure out the number of jurors that represents, I had to use an estimate (a federal courts spokeswoman told me in an email, “We know it’s in the range of 12,208-17,549,” so I took the midpoint of that range).  That’s your first clue that those two types of jury are a little different . A trial jury, also known as a petit jury, tends to be smaller than a grand jury. Its purpose is slightly different, too — a trial jury reaches a verdict (either in favor of plaintiff/defendant in a civil case or guilty/not guilty in a criminal case), and a grand jury is tasked with determining whether there is “probable cause” to believe a person has committed a crime. Technically, adding the number of adults who have served on a trial jury and a grand jury is a little simplistic; it’s possible that someone may have served as a juror twice in a given year, but it’s highly improbable. The random selection process makes it unlikely that someone will get called to serve twice — and once you’ve served, the Jury Act also excuses you from federal jury service for the next two years (exception: if you served on a petit trial that lasted less than a month).  Selection is just one part of this story — a whole lot of Americans get called for duty but never witness a trial (people on grand juries don’t witness a trial, so we’ll exclude them here).  In the 12 months through September 2014, a total of 218,203 U.S. citizens were present for federal trial jury selection — but only 22.4 percent of those adults were eventually selected, according to the U.S. courts. Overall then, 0.09 percent of U.S. adults were called to serve on trial juries in 2014, and 0.02 percent ended up serving.  The federal courts are trying to change those numbers, because inviting a potential jury member and then not selecting her is costly. In the federal system, the courts are required to pay prospective jurors $40 a day, whether they’re selected to serve or not. That means wasted juror time costs the federal judiciary hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.  Selection rates don’t just reflect everything about how the court system works — human behavior is a factor, and some people try to maximize or minimize their chances of getting selected to serve once they’re called upon. I won’t even attempt to quantify that for you, though, Andrew — to do so would require data that could be affected by people’s willingness to tell the truth about what they do when they get called for jury duty, not to mention their ability to be aware of their own biases and behavior.  And once you get past the top-line facts about the number of people called and selected, the reality of who serves on a jury is infinitely more complicated. That’s because the details of a case are of huge importance to the attorneys selecting the jury. This interactive graphic by The New York Times does a good job of illustrating how prosecutors and defense lawyers pick jurors. It’s based on a hypothetical scenario where the plaintiff is a woman in her 60s who says she lost money because her investments were mismanaged. As well as occupation, age and income level, the factors that affect a prospective juror’s chances of being selected for that trial include whether she has close family or friends in the finance industry and even whether she likes crossword puzzles. All of which is yet further evidence that understanding the probability of being selected for jury duty involves a lot of variables.  The numbers do show that the chances of getting called in the past 12 months are pretty low. And the fact that you’ve served on three juries now does seem pretty remarkable, Andrew. But maybe you’re the perfect juror. I don’t know anything about you other than your age, state and gender — let alone details about the trials you’ve served on. All those variables could either make it more surprising that you’ve served three times — or a lot less surprising.  Hope the numbers help,  Mona  Have a question you would like answered here?

Footnotes   That term describes people who speak English as a second language and who have rated their ability to speak English as “well,” “not well” or “not at all.”  You must “reside primarily in the judicial district for one year,” “have no disqualifying mental or physical condition” and “not currently be subject to felony charges punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,” according to the federal courts. What’s more, the following groups are exempt from serving: Members of the armed forces on active duty, members of professional fire and police departments; and “public officers” of federal, state or local governments, who are actively engaged full-time in the performance of public duties. In some state courts, there are additional conditions and exemptions for jury service. In Minnesota , for example, those who are older than 70 can ask to be excused, while in Texas , citizens who can’t read and write or who aren’t “of sound mind and good moral character” are disqualified.

While the majority of jury trials last less than a week, jurors can receive up to $50 a day after serving 10 days on a trial. (Employees of the federal government are paid their regular salary in lieu of this fee.) Jurors also are reimbursed for reasonable transportation expenses and parking fees. Jurors also receive a subsistence allowance covering their meals and lodging if they are required to stay overnight.  Your employer may continue your salary during all or part of your jury service, but federal law does not require an employer to do so. Nonetheless, the Jury Act forbids any employer from firing, intimidating, or coercing any permanent employee because of their federal jury service. You should check whether your company or employer has a policy for employees serving on jury duty.  Grand Jury  Federal jurors are paid $40 a day. Jurors can receive up to $50 a day after serving 45 days on a grand jury. (Employees of the federal government are paid their regular salary in lieu of this fee.)

How will I know which days to report?  Where did the jury office get my name for jury duty?  I do not reside in the county where the court is located. Do I have to serve?  What are the grounds for requesting an excuse from service?  May I postpone my service to a later date?  What are jurors paid?  Where should I park?  May I bring a cell phone, laptop or pager into the courthouse?  What should I wear?  May I smoke?  Will there be breaks? Are there lunch facilities available?  May I bring my children?  Does my employer have to pay me my normal wages during my jury service?  Can my employer fire or discipline me for not being at work due to jury service?  What if my employer wants proof I was there?  What happens if I fail to appear for jury service?     How long do I serve on jury duty?   Jurors are on call for two weeks (10 consecutive court days beginning the first day you are on call). This court is a “one appearance, one trial” court. You will be required to report only once during your two-week on call period. If you are not selected as a juror when you report, your service will be over when jury selection is complete. If you are selected to serve on a trial, you must serve the length of the trial; when the trial is over, your service is complete.   Top of Page    How will I know which days to report?   You must check for reporting instructions the day before your first scheduled reporting date to find out if or when you are required to appear. If you are not required to appear that first day, the message will tell you when to call again. You must continue calling for instructions until the message says your service is over.

Names for potential jurors are randomly drawn from voter registration lists obtained from the Secretary of State of California and from lists of driver's license/identification cards obtained from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

If you live in any of these counties, you are subject to jury service in one of the court's four locations: San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose or Eureka. Once you are summoned to one location, your service cannot be transferred to any other location.  Note that jurors residing farther than 80 miles from the courthouse may be

Jurors are paid an attendance fee of $40.00 per day. Regardless of means of travel, jurors also receive round-trip mileage from their home to the courthouse at the rate currently authorized by the Internal Revenue Service.

415-522-2171 for more information.   Top of Page    Where should I park?   The jury summons includes the addresses of parking lots in the vicinity of the courthouse where the court validates parking. You must bring your parking stub to the jury office for validation. If you park at any lot other than those listed, the court will not be able to validate your ticket; the court will not reimburse you for parking expenses incurred at lots not listed unless parking at the listed lots is for some reason impossible. Metered street parking should be avoided as there will not be regular opportunities to leave the courthouse during the day to feed parking meters.   Top of Page    May I bring a cell phone, laptop or pager into the courthouse?   Yes. Jurors are allowed to bring these devices into the courthouse. Electronic devices must be turned off in courtrooms and whenever the judge so orders. Jurors are expected to be courteous of fellow jurors and court staff by keeping conversation volumes low. Photography is prohibited in the courthouse at all times.   Top of Page    What should I wear?   Jurors should dress comfortably. “Business casual” attire is generally appropriate. Very casual attire such as tank tops, halters, shorts, flip-flops and the like are not appropriate. A sweater or light jacket is recommended as the courtrooms can get cold.   Top of Page    May I smoke?   Smoking is prohibited within the courthouse and within 25 feet of any doorway. Smoking is permitted in outdoor areas 25 feet or more from courthouse doorways. Smoking materials must be disposed of properly.   Top of Page    Will there be breaks? Are there lunch facilities available?

No, there is no law requiring employers to pay employees for the time they miss while performing jury service. If you are paid your normal wages, your employer may require you to turn over the attendance fee that the court pays you.   Top of Page    Can my employer fire or discipline me for not being at work due to jury service?   No. Pursuant to Title 28, U.S.C. § 1875, “No employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any permanent employee by reason of such employee's jury service, or the attendance or scheduled attendance in connection with such service, in any court of the United States.”   Top of Page    What if my employer wants proof I was there?   Certificates of attendance are available on a daily basis.   Top of Page    What happens if I fail to appear for jury service?   Any person who fails to report for jury duty may be served with an order to show cause. The court may then hold a hearing on the order to show cause.

individual must:  be a United States citizen;  be at least 18 years of age;  reside primarily in the judicial district for one year;  be adequately proficient in English to satisfactorily complete the juror qualification form;  have no disqualifying mental or physical condition;  not currently be subject to felony charges punishable by imprisonment for more than one year; and  never have been convicted of a felony (unless civil rights have been legally restored)   There are three groups that are exempt from federal jury service:  members of the armed forces on active duty;  members of professional fire and police departments; and  "public officers" of federal, state or local governments, who are actively engaged full-time in the performance of public duties.   Persons employed on a full-time basis in any of these categories are barred from serving on federal juries, even if they desire to do so.  Excuses from Jury Service  Each of the 94 federal district courts maintains its own jury procedures and policies regarding excuses from jury service. Many courts offer excuses from service, on individual request, to designated groups of persons or occupational classes. Such groups may include persons over age 70; persons who have, within the past two years, served on a federal jury; and persons who serve as volunteer fire fighters or members of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.  The Jury Act also allows courts to excuse a juror from service at the time he or she is summoned on the grounds of "undue hardship or extreme inconvenience." The juror should write a letter to the clerk of court requesting an excuse with an explanation of hardship.  Excuses for jurors are granted at the discretion of the court and cannot be reviewed or appealed to Congress or any other entity.

It's maybe 10% here.  Dress like you're going to a school or better. I avoid having shoes with metal and leave my pocket change in the car to breeze thru metal detectors.  Most trials only last 2 or 3 days if you do get picked. Sometimes you just sit there in the assembly room and finally someone comes in and says "they settled, thank you for your service."         ryan foreman     RE: Jury duty tommorow - what are my chances of being selected?  12/14/2010 5:32PM - in reply to potential jury dude  ryan foreman      Reply   Return to Index   Report Post  It may depend on the state you live but the lawyers will likely ask you a question or two.

Just say that you would favor one side over the other for some reason (personal experience, etc.) and then tell the judge/lawyers that in all honesty you would be biased and would not be fair.  If that doesn't work, tell them that you don't recognize the court because it is supported by money that the government takes by force from you.         My gf has a Whooty!

My personal experience is that I unfortunately made it to the last round of questions to a case I didn't want to sit in on (murder case which was projected to take around a month or more).  I just blurted out "I'm racist" before they even asked me their first question.  I was asked to leave the court room and obviously didn't serve.

You should be able to opt out of jury duty for life. In exchange, you waive your right to trial by jury if charges are ever brought against you. I think that this would be fair. If you don't want to participate in the process, you don't have to. However, you aren't going to choose not to participate in the process when it is inconvenient to do so and then swear that it is your right to have the very same process protect you when it becomes beneficial.         trollism     RE: Jury duty tommorow - what are my chances of being selected?  12/15/2010 11:35AM - in reply to Bear of Bad News  trollism      Reply   Return to Index   Report Post  I enjoyed jury duty.

Mona Chalabi of FiveThirtyEight.com joins NPR's Rachel Martin for a look at who those people are.       UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Fifty-two.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 11:53.  UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Twenty-five.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: 6.11.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Twenty-five thousand eight hundred and forty-two.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Time now for some number crunching from our data expert Mona Chalabi from fivethirtyeight.com. She has given us this number of the week.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: 32 million.  MARTIN: That's the number of people who get summoned each year for jury duty in U.S. state courts. Mona Chalabi has been looking closely at the number of Americans who get called upon to serve on a jury. Hey, Mona.  MONA CHALABI: Hi, Rachel.  MARTIN: So what made you start looking into this particular number?  CHALABI: Well, it actually came as a question from a reader. I write a column as a kind of statistical Dear Abby. This one reader, Andrew, who's 45 and lives in Connecticut, he got in touch to tell me that he had served on multiple juries and wanted to know whether or not that's unusual. So I started to look for some national data. And I came across that number that you mentioned - 32 million. And that's the number of Americans that get summoned each year. The number comes from a 2007 survey by the National Center for State Courts. They surveyed over a thousand local courts and almost 12,000 judges and lawyers to get to that number.  MARTIN: OK.  CHALABI: But the problem is is that I don't have any more recent data since 2007 beyond that one particular survey. It's incredibly hard to collect data from these state courts because there are so many of them and because their practices differ so widely from place to place.  MARTIN: All right, so based on what you do know, is it possible to figure out how many people actually show up for jury duty because it's one thing to get a summons in the mail, but you know, getting to the courthouse is sometimes another.  CHALABI: Yeah, absolutely. The number is far lower than that 32 million we started with. So based on the same survey that comes from these guys, they found that each year, the state court summoned 32 million people, but when it comes to actually showing up, only 8 million people actually report for jury service. And there's lots of reasons why that number reduces from 32 million to 8 million including the 4 million summonses that are returned by the post office marked as undeliverable, the 3 million people that get excused for financial or medical hardship and another 3 million that simply fail to show up.  MARTIN: Three million people just don't come, wow, OK.  CHALABI: Yeah. Exactly.  MARTIN: OK, so 8 million people report for service. Do we know anything about the numbers of those folks who actually get selected for juries?  CHALABI: Yeah, it's even smaller still. So we're down to about 1.5 million Americans each year.  MARTIN: All right, understanding that the details of any particular case will determine the kinds of jurors the attorneys are looking for, is there a kind of person who is more likely to get selected for juries?  CHALABI: Absolutely, but that person will vary depending on the nature of the trial, which is why the math behind this is so difficult. To illustrate that, The New York Times actually created this interactive that shows how many different factors are at play. So it presents you with a hypothetical scenario. In this case, you're a potential juror in a case where the plaintiff is a woman in her 60s. The woman says she's lost money because her investments were mismanaged. Then the interactive asks you dozens of questions, and some of them are things that you might expect anyway, like occupation, age and income level. But then there are also things that are so particular to the case, things like do you have close friends or family in the finance industry and even whether you like crossword puzzles. And if you think about that in terms of variables that I would need to quantify to work out the kinds of people likely to be selected, you start to see that in terms of mathematical probabilities, this is incredibly difficult to understand.  MARTIN: So you're basically saying you're off the hook, right? Like, there's no way that you can tell us the odds of any one of us getting selected for jury duty. All right, fine.  CHALABI: (Laughter) I'm sorry, I really did try.  MARTIN: (Laughter) That's OK. It's our civic duty, we should say. Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight.com. Thanks so much, Mona.  CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel.  (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "54-46 WAS MY NUMBER")  TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS: (Singing) 54-46, that's my number. 54-46 that's my number.  Copyright © 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A reader has been told he must serve as a juror for the fifth time. He’s happy to do so, but repeated summons anger others            Patrick Collinson   Sat 20 Aug 2016 01.59 EDT   Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 11.08 EST           Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email                  View more sharing options      Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger           Close                                                   T wo years ago a reader contacted Guardian Money after being summoned for a fourth time to serve on a jury. Now he has been called up again – and wonders if five trips to the jury box is something of a record.  Robert Smith*, 64, says he has enjoyed his previous stints in court and sees it as his civic duty, which he is proud to undertake. But it has left him scratching his head as to why he is called so often.  Plenty of people go through their lives never being summoned; others are called repeatedly. Is selection really, as the government says, entirely random, or is something else at work here?      Why our jury system can be guilty of inflexibility | Letters           Read more       In 2015 there were 361,300 juror summons issued in England and Wales, but the number who actually sat on a jury was just 179,200. With the two nations having a total population of 57.8 million, it means the chances of serving are relatively slim. The Ministry of Justice declined to give figures on the likelihood of being summoned, but a BBC Scotland analysis found that the probability of being asked to serve is just 40% over a lifetime.  That makes Smith’s five summons very rare. The MoJ says that if you are called within two years of the last time you served you have an automatic right to be excused. Smith’s latest summons is almost exactly two years after his last.  Numerous theories abound on the internet as to why some people are called to serve and others not. Some believe they are blacklisted because they have an Irish heritage (dating back to IRA terrorism days), or that they were once a member of CND. Others believe a letter to the courts suggesting you are a “hanger and flogger” will get you off the hook. Some reckon they have been picked because they have been at the same address or same job for years on end and are a conservative, reliable type.  The reality is rather more dull. The Jury Central Summoning Bureau (JCSB) randomly chooses names from the electoral register. It is under no requirement to call people who are a representative cross-section of society – which is why, in theory, it is possible to have juries which are entirely male or female. According to the MoJ, no attempt is made to balance gender, age or ethnicity. It is as random as the prize number generator for premium bonds. Some people hold premium bonds all their life and win nothing, others win again and again.  Smith says those summoned should prize the experience. “I found it really interesting. Some days it can be immensely frustrating, other days rather boring, and sometimes it’s very harrowing. I see it as a citizenship thing – that is, a duty for those called – and should be a source of pride. Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I’ve been with 12 men and women good and true, and they have been an absolute pleasure to work with.”  Smith acknowledges that he has been 23 years at the same address, but he adds that his first summons was at an earlier address in another London borough. It means he has seen the inside of more crown courts than most career criminals.  Ironically, before Smith became semi-retired he worked in HR, and would regularly write letters to the courts asking for an employee to be excused from jury service. “I worked in a big bank, and some staff were under huge pressure. Often it wasn’t them but their managers who would insist that they could not spare the two weeks out of the office.”  Back in the 1980s and 1990s such letters worked, but today the courts are less keen to excuse people. “They gradually got much tougher about it because everyone was doing it. You can understand why – I think the problem was that juries started to be largely made up of retired people and the unemployed.”         Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I’ve been with 12 men and women good and true    Actually, the figures for excusals remain relatively high: of the 361,300 summons in 2015, 27% were excused – up one percentage point on the year earlier.  Some people are automatically excluded from a summons. You’re not wanted if you’re over 70 or under 18. Neither can you serve if you have been in prison in the past 10 years. But other than that, you’ll need a “good reason” why you are unavailable for the next 12 months, otherwise you will simply be deferred and called again at a later date.  Grounds for excusal include:  • You can’t speak or understand English  • You have responsibilities as a carer  • Your excusal would cause “unusual hardship” for your business  • You are a member of the armed forces and your absence would be prejudicial to the efficiency of the service  Most other excuses are treated as reasons to defer, not to avoid, jury service. It used to be the case that “officials” such as police officers, MPs and judges could gain automatic excusal, but those days are gone – police officers who know a particular court well are simply sent to be jurors at other courts outside their working area, while MPs are allowed to avoid jury service in their constituency but will be expected to attend elsewhere. You can even find yourself on a jury sitting next to a judge. They are only excused if they are known to parties involved in the trial. Other than that, they have to turn up, too.  Much more commonly, you can delay jury service but only once, and you have to say when you will be available over the next 12 months.  The main grounds for deferral are:  • You have a holiday booked  • You are having an operation  • You are a teacher and it is exam time  • You are a taking a temporary job (eg a university student during summer) that you’d lose if forced to attend court  The most common complaints about jury service come from young mothers and the self-employed. Mumsnet forums are alive with complaints from mothers with pre-school children. “The accompanying bumf says they pay £32.47 per day for any childcare costs incurred … round here that would just about pay for three hours’ worth of babysitting,” says one, while another says, “I just completed eight days of jury service (in Scotland) and, despite having three pre-schoolers, I was not excused.”                        Don’t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random. Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS via Getty Images   The £32.47 is the fee paid by the courts as expenses to jurors who serve four hours or under, for 10 days or fewer. The figure rises to £64.95 for more than four hours a day, then goes up the longer the case lasts. The courts will also pay £5.71 a day for food and drink.  Many self-employed argue that £64.95 is hardly enough to cover their losses and, what’s more, the person has to provide evidence of loss of earnings before the sum is paid out. Last year, research by Churchill Home Insurance found that one in 20 employers refused to pay their staff if they undertook jury service, while a third stopped after five days. There is no legal obligation for firms to pay employees while on jury service.  Boredom is perhaps a bigger issue for many who are called up. Much of the time a juror spends in crown court is in a room waiting to be called. The MoJ is trying to tackle this, saying its “juror utilisation rate” has rise by 12% since 2006 to around 71%. But that still means a lot of people spending a lot of time twiddling their thumbs.  Typically, jurors are required to be available for 10 days, but sometimes longer. The MoJ says: “The court will always call more people than may be needed to ensure they have enough people when the juries are being picked. Most jurors are called for approximately 10 working days. During this time you could sit on a number of juries covering a wide range of trials; however this cannot be guaranteed.”  If you are called for a trial, 15 of you will be led into the court room, with 12 eventually selected. But don’t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random to sit on the jury. Only then will you find out if you are on a fascinating trial or something rather more dull. And don’t ever think about skipping service – a juror in Leeds who failed to turn up at court, saying “I can’t be bothered, it’s really boring”, was arrested for contempt of court , while another was fined £100 for filing her nails and reading a magazine while hearing a case. The judge called her behaviour “disgraceful”.  * Robert Smith is not his real name    Topics     Consumer affairs        features         Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email           Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger               Reuse this content                            View all comments >            Order by    newest    oldest    recommendations      Show 25    25    50    100    All      Threads    collapsed    expanded    unthreaded       Loading comments… Trouble loading?

How (un)usual is that?  That is, what percentage of people my age in Canada or the US have been called for jury duty?  Is there some website with any statistics on what proportion of the population is called for jury duty and/or actually serves on a jury, broken down by age or other demographics?

Jury duty is mostly a local matter and each jurisdiction will have its own procedures for calling people and how long they need to serve.  There is also Federal jury duty, but that likely varies throughout each part of the country.  Federal jury duty pays a lot better than local jury duty I believe. And if you really want to cash in, look for a Federal grand jury summons.  Of course, you may have to take 6 months off from work to listen to evidence about some incredibly dull white collar crime case.

Back east was called up several times, and once spent nine months on a grand jury, but only one day a week. Since moving out west 11 years ago, haven't been called once, which is OK by me.

This is compiled regularly (every 1-2 years or so I think) by the Sheriff's office by random sampling from the electoral roll.

I believe they pull jury members out of selective service files and voter registries. However, I'm 24 and have never been called even though I've been registered to vote since 18, so in many cases it is a crap shoot.

Before that, I think it was about 2 years, so it seems that 4½ years would be a good figure for time between Jury Duty calls. I sent them a FAX to tell them that I no longer live in Florida.    __________________  A committee is a thing which takes a week to do what one good man can do in an hour. ~Elbert Hubbard       Reply With Quote            robcaro   View Public Profile  Find all posts by robcaro                                   # 10     12-04-2005, 06:36 PM            ltfire     Guest       Join Date: Dec 2002  Location: E 161 St. and River Ave.  Posts: 1,765               The last time I was called, I spent the day hanging out and was finally dismissed because the defendant copped a plea.

We were told our names were chosen from the roll of registered voters and the list of automobile registrations, and that we can expect to get called on again in about a year.

Actually, many jurisdictions are moving away from using exclusivly the voter registration files for this, fearing that it discourages people from voting.  Often they use other govt files, like driver registration files, or tax files (weeding out corporate/business taxpayers), or even government assistance files (weeding out non-citizens).  But most of them use these in addition to voter registration files, since those are probably the best -- they contain ONLY people of legal age, mental competence, and citizens.  So no need for a weeding-out process at all.

(more than 10 years ago now)  I had actually recieved a summons for a date that had already passed at my college mailbox.  I called the number listed, and said that I didn't live in that county, and had not recieved the notice prior to the date.  They told me not to worry about it.  The time I actually had to go, I had the time to sit on a jury, but alas, all the cases settled prior to needing the jurors, so we were sent home after lunch.  Too bad, as I really did want to serve on a jury.  I've not recieved a summons yet in NH, nor has my wife (that I'm aware of).  She'd be unlikely to be chosen, as she's a paralegal, and from what I've heard, they don't really like folks like her on juries.  I'm registered to vote, drive, and own a car... not sure why I've not been called, but as I don't get paid for time that I don't work, I'd rather not be called at the moment.  -Butler     Reply With Quote            butler1850   View Public Profile  Find all posts by butler1850                     # 16     12-05-2005, 10:58 AM            Neptunian Slug     Guest       Join Date: Jun 2005  Posts: 1,146                 Quote:     Originally Posted by psychonaut   I'm 27 and have never been called for jury duty.

Some key points I remember:  the main list is from voter registration, driver's license lists and property ownership lists  a "formula" such as "every 27th person" or "start with # 12 and and every 30th person after that" is run on the whole list, and those people get a questionaire to fill out and return.  Of the ones who returned the questionaire, some are weeded out  due to being disqualified for some reason, such as age, disability, recent prior jury duty  The ones that don't return the questionaire, get some sort of Stern Letter (I didn't ask further questions.)  Between local and Federal, I've been called 4 times, but only on one jury.

The last time I got selected for the trial (which lasted less than 30 seconds before the parties settled.) The judge told us that people who showed up tend to get called more frequently, It's been just about a year, and nothing yet.  The sick thing is that I'd actually like to be on  a jury, since it would be less of a pain for me than most.

That explains how I was called three times in six years, while my wife has never been called.  More proof why there's no good statistical way to determine how likely you are to be called.    __________________  I'm not just a hack writer -- I'm a hack author      Reply With Quote            kunilou   View Public Profile  Find all posts by kunilou                 Reply         Bookmarks      del.icio.us    Digg    Facebook    Google    reddit    StumbleUpon    Twitter         «  Previous Thread | Next Thread  »       Thread Tools        Show Printable Version   Email this Page       Display Modes        Linear Mode   Switch to Hybrid Mode   Switch to Threaded Mode                 Posting Rules       You may not post new threads  You may not post replies  You may not post attachments  You may not edit your posts   BB code is On  Smilies are On  [IMG] code is Off  HTML code is Off   Forum Rules               Forum Jump    User Control Panel  Private Messages  Subscriptions  Who's Online  Search Forums  Forums Home    Main  About This Message Board  Comments on Cecil's Columns/Staff Reports  General Questions  Great Debates  Elections  Cafe Society  The Game Room  Thread Games  In My Humble Opinion (IMHO)  Mundane Pointless Stuff I Must Share (MPSIMS)  Marketplace  The BBQ Pit                          All times are GMT -5.

In my limited experience, this is fairly common in the US, with most people getting called in and some doing it multiple times. This is a common television trope. Americans could you confirm/deny this?  In Canada, in my experience, this is incredibly rare. I only know this one person who has ever served. I know many senior citizens who have never served. Canadians, am I living in a bubble or is it really rare to get called in for jury duty?  Assuming my two assumptions are true, what gives? Why is jury duty so much more common in the States? I know we have different legal systems, but am pretty ignorant of the differences. Perhaps we have far fewer jury hearings? Perhaps we have far fewer trials per capita? That's my guess.  Anyway, I'd love some insight. Thanks.

It happened to me once in 30 years - and then was cancelled. Apparently it was a game of chicken between he defense and the crown over a plea deal, and within a few weeks, someone caved with a month to go.  My wife got called once too, recently - and excused when she asked how it would affect her night course committment.  In Canada the laws were amended to remove that pesky option that our peers can ensure justice is done; I've gotten in trouble on other threads for misstating the details, but I believe the current law says that a jury trial is only an option if the maximum sentence is 5 years or more. IIRC, this happened about the time of Trudeau.  there's also the option of a jury trial depending on how the charges are laid IIRC, I'm sure a Canadian lawyer can chime in with the exact details.  So where the Americans often have jury trials over the most trivial of offenses, Canadian crown prosecutors are insulated from having to allow the real world sentiments of the general public infuse the courtroom with common sense.  (I also suspect that a lot of cases are filed as the less serious charges simply to avoid having to allow a perp the opportunity of a jury trial.)  However, Stephen Harper may manage to change this system if he follows through on his threat/promise to make far more crimes result in higher sentences.  Also, if you do not live near one of the larger cities where these major trials are usually heard, you may also not be summoned for jury duy.

In the US, the majority of jury trials nowadays are for civil cases, not criminal.  The US is more litigious than Canada, which is probably a factor.

A lot of the litigation in the USA starts on the premise that, on top of everything else, you owe me a huge amount for medical bills.  Not a problem in Canada, virtually no medical bills. You have an acident, what are you going to sue for? IIRC, pain and suffering is not a big money-maker in Canada. Plus, most law societies are hostile to the idea of contingency fees, so you need to be able to afford a lawyer; and if you lose, you pay the other guy's legal bills in almost every case - something the USA should do.  It encourages careful examination of the case before filing.  I recall a class-action attempt a few years ago where the judge basically told the group unless they could post a bond for the amount of the other side's potential legal bills, he would disallow the case, since it was pretty weak to start with.

It was for a limited time (three months, I think) and got called for jury selection just once in that time, and the jury was selected before my number was called. There were about 150 of us in the pool, so the odds of getting picked for actual duty were quite small.

I know a large number of people that have been called but excused due to their occupation, student status, politics, personal reasons, etc.. Most public servants, doctors, nurses, teachers, etc. are excused because they would best serve the public good remaining at their place of employment.  I quite enjoyed my term on a jury but one of my benefits is paid leave while on jury duty, I really sympathized with other jurors who were forced to be there but were losing pay at their own jobs, especially as the trial dragged on and we were almost sequestered for our deliberations.

IIRC, this happened about the time of Trudeau.     Yes, you've got in trouble before on this topic, not because of minor disagreements about details, but because you're flat out WRONG!  Here's my post from the previous thread where you stated your WRONG opinions as facts:    Quote:     Originally Posted by Northern Piper    Quote:     Originally Posted by md2000   (IANAL...) Pierre Trudeau's government basically eliminated the right to a jury trial unless the offense(s) charged was punishable by 7 years or more, IIRC. The commentary at the time was that jury trials were too difficult and expensive, and juries did not always do what the prosecutor wanted; while judges were less likely to be swayed from the letter of the law by details like sympathy and common decency, aka natural justice     md2000 , your comment is simply nonsensical and wrong.  The Criminal Code provides that offences can be prosecuted in one of two ways: by summary conviction, or by indictment.  The two main differences between summary conviction and indictment are in the penalty and in the manner of trial. If the Crown proceeds by way of summary conviction, the trial is by judge alone, in the Provincial Court. However, the general rule is that the maximum jail time is six months, as set out in s. 787(1) of the Code :    Quote:     General penalty  787. (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, everyone who is convicted of an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or to both.    Thus, if the Crown is seeking a penalty of more than six months' imprisonment, the Crown must proceed by way of indictment.  The basic principle for trials by indictment is set out in s. 471 of the Code :    Quote:     Trial by jury compulsory  471. Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, every accused who is charged with an indictable offence shall be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury.     (My underlining.)  So, the starting point for charges where the accused faces more than six months' imprisonment is that the trial will be by jury.  Now, that doesn't mean that all trials on indictment will actually be by jury, because the Code gives the accused, not the Crown, the power to elect trial by judge alone.  This principle is set out in s. 536 of the Code , which provides:    Quote:     536 (2) If an accused is before a justice charged with an indictable offence, other than an offence listed in section 469, and the offence is not one over which a provincial court judge has absolute jurisdiction under section 553, the justice shall, after the information has been read to the accused, put the accused to an election in the following words:  You have the option to elect to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a preliminary inquiry;  or you may elect to be tried by a judge without a jury;  or you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury .   If you do not elect now, you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury.  If you elect to be tried by a judge without a jury or by a court composed of a judge and jury or if you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, you will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the prosecutor requests one. How do you elect to be tried?  (My indents and underlining to help make a block of text more readable).  So, it's up to the accused to elect not to have a trial by judge and jury, not the Crown. And if the accused fails to make an election, the default is again a trial by judge and jury.  (The reference to offences listed in s. 469, by the way, refers to the most serious offences, such as murder, which must be tried in the superior court. It is possible to have a trial by judge alone in those cases as well, but only if both the accused and the Crown consent to trial by judge alone; see s. 473(1) .).  Thus, the basic principle of Canadian criminal procedure is that in cases where the accused is facing more than six months' imprisonment, the accused has the right to a jury trial. The accused can waive that right, but the Crown cannot take away the accused's right to a jury.  There is only one case where the Crown can override the accused's election with respect to manner of trial, but it goes the other way: if the accused is facing more than 5 years' imprisonment and has elected trial by judge alone, the Attorney General can require that the trial be by judge and jury, as set out in s. 568 :    Quote:     Attorney General may require trial by jury  568. Even if an accused elects under section 536 or re-elects under section 561 or subsection 565(2) to be tried by a judge or provincial court judge, as the case may be, the Attorney General may require the accused to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury unless the alleged offence is one that is punishable with imprisonment for five years or less. If the Attorney General so requires, a judge or provincial court judge has no jurisdiction to try the accused under this Part and a preliminary inquiry must be held if requested under subsection 536(4), unless one has already been held or the re-election was made under subsection 565(2).    So, far from giving the Crown the power to deny the accused a right to a jury, the Code says that in certain cases the Attorney General may insist on a trial by jury.  And what does Pierre Trudeau have to do with any of this? well, nothing with respect to these provisions of the Criminal Code. They aren't new - they were the law before he became Prime Minister and continued to be so after he left office, without any change.  The only thing Mr Trudeau had to do with jury trials was to ensure that the right to a jury trial is enshrined in the Constitution, in s. 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms :    Quote:     Proceedings in criminal and penal matters  11. Any person charged with an offence has the right ... (f) except in the case of an offence under military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or a more severe punishment;    In other words, Mr Trudeau turned what had been a statutory right to a jury into a constitutional right, to bar Parliament from taking away the right to a jury trial, in cases where the potential punishment is more than 5 years.  Hardly the action of someone with "Dictatorial tendencies" - to entrench the right to a jury trial in the Constitution.        So to summarise:  1. The Charter guarantees the right to a jury trial for any offence where the penalty is more than 5 years;  2. Parliament has gone further than the constitutional minimum and has provided that anyone who tried by indictment (generally speaking, an offence carrying more than six months imprisonment) has a right to a jury;  3. A jury trial is the default for indictable matters;  4. It's the right of the accused to elect not to have a jury trial in indictable matters;  5. The Crown cannot take away the right to a jury;  in certain cases, the Crown can compel a jury trial;  6. Trudeau did not take away any rights  to a jury trial;  he entrenched the right to a jury for offences of more than 5 years' imprisonment in the Charter, as a constitutional guarantee.   md2000 , please stop spreading misinformation!

To those four provinces specifically mentioned, I would add Saskatchewan, which also allows contingency fees.

I personally have been called 4 times and served twice, once on a civil case, and once on a criminal (first degree murder) case.

The first of these is that the significant majority of criminal matters are heard in lower level or provincial courts. These courts never sit with a jury, and hear matters of summary jurisdiction (sentences including an option of up to six months custody), or hybrid offences where the Crown has chosen to proceed by indictment (which can be heard by a Superior or Queen's Bench court, and may involve a jury), but where the accused has elected to have the matter heard in provincial court.  Typically, a common reason accused persons choose trial in provincial court (where the choice exists) is that they want the matter resolved more quickly - usually because they are in custody having been denied bail. Superior court level trials - especially jury trials - take far longer to come to hearing.  Where a matter proceeds to trial in Superior court, many accused choose trial before a judge sitting without a jury because their defence involves or centres around a question of law, or an alleged breach of the Charter rights of the accused. Even where a jury is sitting, a Charter challenge is something a judge alone determines; and they can be determinative of whether a case continues.  For example, a suspected drug dealer is pulled over by police, is questioned and searched, and has his car searched and drugs are found. He is then arrested. Defence will argue that the police violated the accused's Charter rights by detaining him without telling him why, or informing him of his rights upon detention, and searching the vehicle without justification. If the Court finds that any or all of these actions have breached the rights of the accused, one of the remedies to this is to exclude any evidence seized as a result of the breach. No drugs = no case. Often, this is the only "defence" an accused can raise, thus if no breach is found, or one is found but the drugs are still admitted as evidence, the accused typically will then enter a guilty plea.  Jury trials in Canada are usually chosen in matters where the accused is trying to elicit a degree of sympathy from the jury (provocation, honest mistake, etc.) or where they are angling for a lesser conviction (manslaughter vs. murder, 2nd degree vs. 1st degree murder, etc.). This choice is almost exclusively the right of the accused. There is only one avenue where the Crown can force a jury trial, and that is the case of a direct indictment, where the accused spends no time in provincial court, and all proceedings are initiated and occur in Superior court. Direct indictments are a comparative rarity, and even then it is not unheard of for the Crown to consent to a direct indictment matter being heard by a judge sitting alone.  In my personal experience, jury trials are typically much harder and time consuming to conduct, and are also fraught with more opportunity for errors leading to appeals. When you combine that with the fact that so many of those chosen for jury duty try all manner of excuses to get out of serving, the ratio of judge & jury to judge alone seems to be about right.

Two or three other times I received a postcard notifying me to call the county courthouse the night before a particular day to see if I would have to go to the courthouse to be considered for being a juror, but those two or three times I got a recorded message when I called that I didn't have to report on that particular day.

Posts: 25,958                Spare Me 's summary of the practicalities counting towards judge alone and away from jury trials in criminal matters strike me as accurate.  For civil matters, there's the fact that jury trials tend to be longer, which adds to the expense.  In civil matters the loser pays the winner's court costs, which includes costs of the jury and the associated longer trial costs, which is one factor counting against jury trials in civil matters.

At least under the US constitution; individual states can have stricter requirments and many require a jury trial if there's any possibility of a custodial sentence at all.     Some states have "misdemeanor juries" with just 6 members (as opposed to the "felony juries" that sit with 12).    __________________  No  Go ds,  No  Mas ters      Reply With Quote            alphaboi867   View Public Profile  Find all posts by alphaboi867                     # 29     05-16-2012, 11:44 PM            Northern Piper     Charter Member       Join Date: Jun 1999  Location: Winter wonderland!

Very informative. It seems that:  1) Yeah, Canadians don't have that many jury trials, for various reasons, but...  2) Americans don't have that many jury trials either.  Interesting. Thanks for fighting my ignorance!

I did some research on jury trials awhile back and came across the interesting fact that an estimated 90% of all jury trials in the world are in the U.S.  The deprivation of trial by jury was a key complaint against King George III, and it's always been a very important part of our court system.  I dealt with juries as a prosecutor many times, and have done so a handful of times as a magistrate.  I'd love to serve on a jury someday but have just never had the chance.  My wife and I are both about the same age and have been registered voters for almost 30 years.  I've been called exactly once in all that time, and was excused as unneeded without ever setting foot in the courtroom.  My wife has been summoned twice, each time after the birth of one of our children, and was likewise excused.  Most civil cases in the U.S. are settled before trial, and most criminal cases result in a plea agreement before trial.  Of those which actually go to trial, relatively few do so before a jury.  But you never know, and it's nice to have it as an option.  I'll let G.K. Chesteron, in his inimitable style, explain the usefulness of juries: http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/voic...y.php?page=all      Reply With Quote            Elendil's Heir   View Public Profile  Find all posts by Elendil's Heir                     # 34     05-17-2012, 10:37 AM            mnemosyne     Guest       Join Date: Feb 2000  Location: Montréal, Québec  Posts: 8,772                 Quote:     Originally Posted by Northern Piper    Thank you all!

And now, ladies and gentlemen, for your listening pleasure, let's have a round of applause for Northern Piper , who will read to you section 144 of the Canada Criminal Code, Escapes and Rescues !!!    Since civil matters in Québec don't use jury trials, getting a jury summons here tends to cause a small amount of fear because you know it's going to be a criminal matter and you really, really hope it isn't a long trial about [that gory/upsetting/truly depraved thing] you heard on the news a while back.  I got called back in September and was told to "be available", whatever that meant, for the fall session (until the end of November). I was told to go to the court house once, where I sat around for 8 hours and did absolutely nothing at all other than chat with other people. I never got called to talk to anyone, and at the end of the day they announced that they had a jury and I got sent home. I got reimbursed for my Subway sandwich lunch and $6 for transit, although I had a bus pass at a discounted rate (yay,  profit!).  Since I didn't even speak to anyone official - only a "bonjour" to the woman who handed me an instruction sheet - I never got to find out whether having a cousin who is an RCMP detective in the region was enough to get me out of jury duty. Though I was unemployed and bored at the time, and I kind of wanted to serve, just to do something!

I still don't understand, like the OP, why the ratio - real or perceived - of jury trials is so much much lower in Canada. There are a huge number of cases invlving crimes where sentence is over 6 months, just like the USA, but it rarely seems they are jury trials unless its a very high profile case.  Is the choice of jury the prosecutors' choice or always the defendant's choice in the USA and Canada?

According to Northern Piper, in cases where a jury trial is allowed, the choice is the defendant's (though the prosecution can override the choice not to have one in some cases).

There was a trial of a juror for obstruction of justice several years ago where I live and that was one of the talking points on the radio.  This may contribute to the perception that juries are less common (ie they can't talk to the media, so the media don't pay as much attention to them).

People gripe about jury service, but also know that they just might benefit from a trial before a jury of their peers rather than a bored, jaded, seen-it-all, harsh or crooked judge if they ever got in trouble.

This is an indictable matter, and the accused had elected trial by a judge alone.  Because I was interested, I dealt with the matter I was at the courthouse for, and then managed to squeeze into the public gallery to hear the verdict in the second-degree murder trial.  The judge carefully read through the evidence, stated the facts that he accepted, and rendered the verdict.  The entire verdict took about 90 minutes to read.  Not as dramatic as the jury filing back into the courtroom and saying, "We the jury find the accused..." perhaps; but unlike with a jury, the judge's reasoning was plain to see (hear?).  Perhaps that's one advantage to a "judge alone" trial: the way the judge arrives at a decision is laid bare.

In Ohio, the law now strongly favors jury service by all.  Judges, magistrates and lawyers of all kinds may serve on juries.  (A very liberal judge served as foreman of a criminal trial jury a few years ago and, much to everyone's surprise, joined their unanimous verdict of guilty).  The trial judges in such cases will usually give a special instruction that the legally-trained juror is not to unduly influence the jury, instruct them in the law, dominate discussion, etc., and moreover must accept the instructions of law provided by the trial judge.    Quote:     Originally Posted by Spoons    ...Perhaps that's one advantage to a "judge alone" trial: the way the judge arrives at a decision is laid bare.     Not necessarily.  In Ohio, a judge customarily will give at least a brief explanation of why he or she decided upon guilt or innocence, but is not required to.  And a particular sentence need not be explained unless the judge goes higher than the recommended sentence for that particular offense.

Posts: 25,958               That's a difference in the two systems, then. In Canada a judge is required to give reasons and can be overturned on appeal if the reasons do not provide a sufficient basis for meaningful appellate review.

Sentencing in the matter whose verdict I attended today has been adjourned until next week.  This will give the Crown and the defence time to prepare sentencing arguments--necessary, given the verdict.  In a nutshell, the accused was on trial for second-degree murder.  The judge found that the necessary mens rea for that charge was not made out by the Crown; but as there was still a deceased at the end of the fight between the accused and the deceased, a manslaughter conviction was appropriate.  This was unexpected, but not entirely so.  Given the verdict of manslaughter, however, I would expect both sides to require time to do research and to prepare sentencing arguments appropriate to the conviction.  I will try to attend at the sentencing hearing next week.  Should anybody be interested, I would be happy to post an update (if I can make it to the sentencing hearing, that is).

Here in Canada, a lawyer (and by extension, a judge) may not serve on a jury--such people are automatically excused from doing so.  In fact, to the best of my knowledge, anybody who has attended even one year of law school may not serve.  More apropos to the thread, I will say that prior to my attendance at law school, I was called for jury service twice.  Once was the coroner's jury I referred to upthread; the other was shortly after I moved across country (and was thus ineligible in the requesting jurisdiction anyway).  Now, as a fully-licensed lawyer, I am barred for life from jury service in Canada.   Elendil's Heir , should I be able to attend at court on the day of the sentencing hearing I referred to above, I will post an update.

Looking at this thread: http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/...d.php?t=439026  and many others about people who want to avoid Jury Duty, I'm wondering if there is anything you can do to make yourself more likely to be picked. I'd like to be on a jury; it would be interesting to see the process first hand and it would give me some time off work with pay. Is there anything you can do to make your name more likely to come up?

Call your local Board of Elections, or the local courts, to ask about that.  Once you're in the jury pool, my understanding is that who will be part of the jury is determined by lot - at least that's how my experience was.  So I don't think you can actually finagle your way into an actual jury.

I don't think a broad education is considered a liability, but specific knowledge germaine to a case might be because both sides figure your mind is made up from your training and isn't as likely to be influenced by testimony introduced in the trial.  In other words, you aren't the blank slate they prefer.  I was picked for a jury to decide if a sex offender was still a threat to society and must be kept under control even though he had served his time.  A question posed to each juror was, "How knowledgeable are you about psychology?"  I replied I had 3 college hours in psychology as a minimum bachelor's degree requirement, but it wasn't my major nor my occupation by a long shot.  I was retained.

I'm 32, registered to vote since the day I turned 18, and I've gotten a notice twice in all those years - and that was twice in two weeks. Since I couldn't financially spare that much time off, and one day of showing up gets you "off" for a year, I called and disputed the second one and they told me never mind. But still, I want to do it, just not quite that often or quite this infrequently, y'know?  And the day I did go in, I didn't even get called for anything at all. It was less than a week after 9-11, and I had to take the El for the first time, got myself all in a flutter and panic (and, to make my day even more delightful, my husband had kindly packed a 9 inch long ceremonial knife in my bag that I didn't know about. Not intentionally - I had brought the bag to church and he packed my athame for me in a pocket I don't usually use, so I didn't think to check for it. Security was not amused.) and then I just sat around all day in one of the largest target high-rise buildings in Chicago reading a book. Mmmmm....nerve-wracking and boring, my favorite combination!  Still, I do want to do my duty, I think it'd be interesting, I'm a stay at home mom with plenty of contacts for babysitting, so even a multi-day trial wouldn't suck (although a sequestered months long thing would, of course) and I have some but not too much higher education (A.A.). I'd be gold, right? But my numbers won't hit in their lottery.     Reply With Quote            WhyNot   View Public Profile  Visit WhyNot's homepage!

I'd like to be on a jury; it would be interesting to see the process first hand and it would give me some time off work with pay. Is there anything you can do to make your name more likely to come up?     Are you looking to be on a JURY or just have to serve "Jury Duty"?  Jury duty (for me) is showing up the courthouse with hundreds of other citizens. Then, we get broken into smaller groups of 100 or so, and get sent to a courtroom. There, shit happens, and sometimes you start the voir dire (jury selection) process. Sometimes you don't.  There is probably some city office you can call to make sure you're on the jury duty list. I know people who haven't been called for the 15 years they've lived in Baltimore. Clearly, whatever database jury duty is pulling from doesn't have them in there.  To be selected for a jury, who knows. Probably dependent on the lawyers quick assessment of you (they might know whether you're married, your education level, your job, whether you've been convicted of a crime, and a couple other things.)  I've had jury duty several times. Most times during the voir dire process (the jury selection process), they've filled before they get to me. I've been rejected by defendant's lawyers a couple times. I'm white (seems to be a biggie for some lawyers), and my occupation and education are listed as "engineer" and "masters degree", respectively.

I wanted to serve on the jury the one time I was called but the defendant, choosing to represent himself, did not help select the jury at all (whether or not he had a right to do that as his own council I don't know.)  He was an attractive man in his early 20's, so when the prosecutor was picking a jury she chose a panel made up entirely of middle aged men.  At the time I was a 22 year old woman so I was stuck in the back and actively ignored when she was asking questions of the potential jurors.  He kind of shot himself in the foot by not helping to select the jury if he had the option since the attorney made sure to pick the jury she felt would cut him the least amount of slack.

I work as a paralegal and have participated in trials from the perspective of being at the defense table, but wanted to see what it was like from the jury's side. Both sides seemed comfortable with that, and the judge was bemused.  Unfortunately, the case involved some potential police misconduct, and one of the questions posed to all of us was whether anyone had had any negative experience with law enforcement. I was honest and said "yes," and off I went.  The defense attorney in the case came up to me later and mentioned how disappointed he was that I'd said anything because he really wanted me on that jury. Which probably proves that the prosecutor made the right call booting me off.

The second time I was called, I was not selected, but I think it was actually because I was pregnant.  They took one look at me and didn't even ask me any questions, they just dismissed me.  I figured it was because it was a drunk driving case...they didn't want any hysterical mommies on the jury.

I live in a very rural county south of Cleveland.  During the selection process, one of the jurors was asked about his occupation. He'd been a policeman in Cleveland. Had he ever worked in narcotics? Yes, for years. I figured he'd be out of there so fast he wouldn't even get to warm the seat. (As I found out later, he thought the same thing.) But there he sat on the jury after all the dust settled, and he ended up being our foreman. I was glad he was there; he was a font of knowledge about procedure, as well as drugs.  More interestingly (in a Jerry Springer sort of way) was the woman who was originally seated next to me. When they asked if anyone knew of a reason they couldn't serve on the jury, she raised her hand and said, "Yeah, like, the guy who was there in the house and is in the mental hospital now? That's my brother."

When I was a civil litigator, we were generally hoping and praying for intelligent, educated jurors.  We kicked off people who were too uneducated to understand the case or the process.  (For example, I remember using a strike to throw off a woman who had served on both civil and criminal juries in the past, but did not know the difference between a civil and a criminal case.  Yikes!)  What we generally didn't want were: -lawyers -experts in the field the case was about  That was because lawyers and experts tend to have their own ideas about things, regardless of what evidence is presented, and are wild cards in the jury room.  They also tend to lead the juries.  But, a general college education was considered a wonderful thing.  I think the supposed theory behind wanting uneducated jurors is that they will be easily led by lawyers and expert witnesses.  That theory is woefully out of date.  Any reverence that uneducated people had for lawyers and expert witnesses is long gone.  In fact, in my limited experience, uneducated jurors also tend to be wild cards, because they don't want to listen to wealthy lawyers and wealthy experts.  They also tend to have opinions that are 1) uninformed and 2) not swayed by anything that happens at trial.  Post-trial polls revealed strong biases against anyone who appeared to be wealthy and/or educated, whether those people were lawyers, plaintiffs, defendants, or expert witnesses.  Uneducated people actually seemed to hate expert witnesses who had impressive credentials as being "too full of themselves" and would listen more to lesser-qualified local expert witnesses than they would to a person at the top of their field with lots of education and experience.  I would take a college-educated person on a civil jury any day.  People with less education can be good jurors, but in general, are problematic.     Reply With Quote            Q.N.

What, really? No, I don't mean to suggest I disbelieve you, as I actually find it quite cute in a way.  It's much like the tales of people who want to marry without a fuss, so they just grab a couple of witnesses from whatever passers-by happen to be around.  After all, it still *mostly* fits in with the normal idea of random selection of the adult population, and I expect any person called like that would be subject to the same "many are called but few are chosen" thing as those done by the blindly sticking of pins into the electoral register method, but it just *is* sort of cute and funny.   One imagines all sorts of bad happenings in the whatever locality - weather problems leading to complete breakdown of transport thus non-appearance of the predicted pool of potential jurors, unexpected nuclear strike  leading to shortage of people and so on.   Large percentage of potential juror pool eaten by dragons, that sort of thing.  But the only times I was called, well, the normal way, is "this here letter says you MUST, you simply MUST, turn up (or 'phone giving your reference number to find whether you must, or need not) at the High Court on Monday the nth, otherwise we shall be MOST displeased, and you would not like us when we are displeased, oh no!  Otherwise, find a good excuse, like advanced old age or a medical reason, which must be certified by your doctor and sent it to us in official-type writing damn fast."  But, come to think of it, just grabbing potential jurors from the street at least does away with the inability thing, doesn't it?  I mean, anyone happily going about their business when grabbed by the keen young court-attendant person is, by definition, not in hospital dying of the Black Death, so that's one objection done away with.  Of course, were I the evil criminal due to be tried, and were I to know of this idiosyncratic system, I might just want to persuade some friends to "happen" to be passing by the court at the appropriate time   (Hmmmm  .... there is potential.   Do we have any Dopers who could write a short comedy based on this whole lovely idea of juror selection the easy way? )  So then, for the O.P. Mr. Shine , perhaps take a day off work and loiter around the court.   Take some sandwiches and water/fruit juice, sit around ever so nonchalantly and, you know, just lurk around and see if anyone solicits your services.  Of course, it just might be the local police enquiring as to precisely why you are so determinedly loitering around .....

He said that they somehow select people who they know will turn up.  It seems to work - I've been called twice in the three years after the first I was on.  In California the calls come from the drivers license rolls and the voting rolls - so if your name is spelled differently on these, you'll have two shots. But it mostly seems random. I lived for 15 years in NJ, voting every year, and never got called once. I got called a few years after moving to California, then once the next four, and then a lot in the last three.  I've never seen any bias on education. People in Silicon Valley used to say engineers would never be selected, for being too logical, but that hasn't been the case.

Mostly I sat around the jury pool room and never got taken into a courtroom for empanelment.  With two exceptions:  For a civil trial, the judge introduced the lawyers, the parties, and names of some prospective witnesses and asked if we knew them.  The plaintiff's name was unusual and it hit me -- I knew how to spell it.  The judge gave a brief description of what the case was about and it hit me -- several months before, I'd proofread some pretrial discovery depositions in the case for the court reporters who'd taken them.  Oddly enough, when the attorneys learned that fact, neither side wanted me on that jury.   The other case was criminal.  We the jury pool were given the usual instructive spiel, waited about, got taken into a courtroom, waited about while the attorneys whispered with the judge at sidebar, got taken back to the jury pool room, waited about, and were finally treated to the judge entering to personally thank us and inform us that the defendant, after taking a good look at the panel of his peers ready to sit in judgment on his case, had chosen to plead guilty.

Once in NC in 1982, and once here (VA), a couple months ago.  Dunno why it's taken so long for them to call me - we've lived here since 1989, have a house (property tax), pay income taxes, have drivers' licenses etc. You'd think the pool of qualified jurors would be such that we'd get called a bit more often but I guess not.  In 82 I did my day sitting around waiting then was sent home. This time around, I was torn between wanting to serve, and realizing that medically I really could not (sleep disorder, highly unlikely I could have stayed awake).  I wound up not being needed either of my two days.  Typo was called - and actually served for one short trial - in 1995 but until yesterday, never heard from them again. He just got his questionnaire so it's likely he'll get his call some time this winter. Oh - and he's got a PhD and was not booted during that earlier trial.

If a lawyer intends to present a complicated case, he wants jurors smart enough to understand what he's telling them. On the other hand, the opposing counsel will probably prefer jurors too dumb to understand the arguments.  Crude example: if a prosecutor's case relies heavily on scientific expert testimony and DNA evidence, he'll want jurors bright enough to know what DNA is and smart enough to understand probability. The defense team will want jurors who DON'T understand such things ("DNA, schmee-N-A, that's just a bunch of scientific mumbo jumbo!").

Most are pretty mundane affairs.  I've been called for jury duty 3 times, and only served once. The two times I was rejected, it was due to sheer dumb luck: I drew a high number, and they picked almost all of the people who sat in the front two rows!  In each case, the lawyers asked only perfunctory questions, and rejected only one or two people who seemed like utter idiots.  So, in a high profile case with big bucks and/or long jail sentences at stake, lawyers may get extremely selective. But in a more petty case, they'll probably just take the first 12 people in the jury pool, so long as they don't say anything really goofy our outrageous during voir dire.

We rarely average as many as 20 murders a year statewide nor ever have scandals like enron, so how many crimes that involve juries can we possibily have?  Oooo, maybe those folks from Plainsfield who hid out from the government for a few years will go to trial for tax evasion.

It's "common knowledge" that more educated people are more likely to be kicked off by one of the lawyers.  Does anyone know if this is actually true?     I worked for a criminal defense lawyer that did federal and state cases, and education has never been, to my knowledge, much of a factor in selecting juries. Astorian's explanation sounds pretty reasonable. But, from the cases I've seen tried, ranging from simple to complicated, there seemed to be a wide range of education in the jurors. All of the cases I've seen have had jurors with college degrees, both bachelor's and even master's and Ph.Ds.  My guess is that it's rather unlikely that you would get kicked out for that reason alone, but I'm sure some lawyers may take that into more consideration than the ones I worked for. (I know one lawyer would even ask silly questions like "do you prefer red or blue" as some sort of voodoo insight on one's personality. Whatever.)  Anyhow, the only voir dire I've participated, I got booted off the jury (I would guess because I worked for criminal defense lawyers, or perhaps [more likely] because I had a friend who was a victim of the same crime as that that was being prosecuted. From what I remember, education was not even a question asked in voir dire.)      Last edited by pulykamell; 10-06-2007 at 01:54 AM .

My personal experience is the first time I was called for jury duty was to the Federal court in San Diego, and I was seated as an alternate for a marijuana smuggling & sales case. Though I remained an alternate for the entire trial and thus did not participate in deliberations, I found the parts I was involved in fascinating.  Since then every time I have been called has been to the state court. And without exception each time that I have been included in voir dire I have been dismissed by one of the sides, more often than not with their first peremptory challenge.

I was amazed they kept me on, to be honest.  I think the fact that I'd only worked in criminal law was the reason they kept me.

Also, in California, at least, counsel is allowed significantly fewer exemptions than used to be the case; so I think if you are called you have a better chance of having to actually participate in a trial.

The case involved a defendant who ran over a victim, twice, in a car.   Fortunately it was a very small car so the victim was able to limp away from it.   I wonder if they thought the engineer would have influenced the rest of us with special knowledge about the forces involved when a car runs over someone.  I was intentionally vague about my work in IT and perhaps made it sound "lower" than it is, because I wanted to be chosen.

Who is eligible for jury service?    Image copyright  PA   Groups of 15 ordinary women and men are selected at random to uphold justice in their local community. It is a civic duty they are obliged to perform. Potential jurors must be at least 18 years old and they should be listed on the electoral roll. They must also have lived in the UK for more than five years since they were 13 years old. However people in some jobs - for example solicitors and police constables - cannot be cited to appear on a jury.     Others who have committed crimes and served time in prison are likely to be disqualified. MPs, MSPs, religious ministers, full-time serving members of the armed forces and people who are over 70 can legitimately apply to be excused. There is a full list of exemptions here . What is the chance of being called for jury service?    Image copyright  Thinkstock   BBC Radio 4's More or Less asked Deirdre Toher, a statistics lecturer at the University of the West of England, to calculate the probability of an eligible person being asked to serve on a jury. She used figures obtained from the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service. She told the programme: "The chance of being called for jury service, as in receiving a citation for jury service, in Scotland is approximately 95% across the 53 years of typical eligibility." Although many people will receive a letter asking them to serve on a jury, far fewer will actually be selected to sit on the jurors' benches. About 30 men and women will be invited to court and 15 will be selected to be part of a jury. In fact, the chance of actually serving on a Scottish jury is about 30%, according to Ms Toher. The probability of being asked to be part of a jury more than once is about 40%, she added. How does that compare to England and Wales?    Image copyright  Thinkstock   South of the border, juries are made up of 12 people, and the odds of being selected for the job are far lower than in Scotland. According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice, there is about a 35% chance of people in England and Wales being summoned for jury service over the course of their lifetime. Only about half of those cited spend any time in court. Listen to the analysis on BBC Radio 4's More or Less on the BBC Radio iPlayer here.

I was on a panel for a trial that made the newspapers (they picked the jury before my turn came) and on another jury which was an interesting decision. Other than they need to pay more it's relatively painless with the one day, one jury system. There is a good chance you will never need to even show up. In any case, my experience was the ones who most wanted to get out were invariably picked for the juries.           Report as inappropriate      12/29/2008                     Elizabeth G.

Sunnyvale, CA           62 friends        0 reviews         It makes me sad, when I read about people who want to duck out of Jury Duty. Please reread what Lauren wrote. I feel that I was lucky to get the Jury I got, when I was falsely accused of a crime. I was accused by a police officer, I had gone to High School with. He claimed not to know me, but he was in my P.E. class in high school. He was a bully than and still is. I was found innocent on one charge, and they dead locked on the second. The DA did not believe the cop in the end. No further charges were ever made. It all started with a minor traffic stop. I felt lucky, that the people listened to my case. - I hope this never happens to you. I could have gone to jail for several years. It is not always bad people that end up in court. - Some are falsely accused. The last time I was called to Jury duty, my dad had just died. They gave me a deferral, and I have not been called since. The time before, I was called, the group of us was in the room waiting to go into the court room, and when the Bailiff told the Judge the Jury was ready, the guy changed his plea to guilty. ( I think he thought the judge would give him a better sentence) We were than excused for that year. The time before that, we the jury I was in, found the guy guilty. It was not even close. We came to the decision in just a few hours. 2 hours ago Lauren C. says: I don't love it either, but it's a privilege as an American citizen to sit on a jury to judge one of your peers.

There are many countries where you can't participate, or you can, but it's a facade covering corruption on a massive Federal scale. The US is for the most part different from this and is comparatively open.  It does mean that we make sacrifices in our individual lives for the sake of the community, city, state, or country.  But considering the alternatives, such sacrifices like Jury Duty or taking the time to vote, are small in comparison.

It's simply the luck of the draw.  Ron Chapple/The Image Bank/Getty Images      Whether you consider it "good" luck or "bad," some people do get called for jury duty more than others. There is no government conspiracy behind the fact that you may have received four jury summons in the past decade while your neighbor hasn't gotten one; it's simply the luck of the draw. It's like those people who win the lottery multiple times, except instead of getting millions of dollars, you get to sit in a stuffy courthouse waiting room with slow WiFi.  The simple reason why some people get summoned to report for jury duty more than others is that the selection system is completely random. Prospective jurors are randomly picked by a computer from the jury pool. The pool, in most states, is a combined list of names from both the voter registration rolls and the driver's license database.            If your name is in the jury pool, there is no limit to the number of times that you can be flagged for jury duty. The good news is that once you report for service, your name is pulled from the jury pool for at least the next 12 months, even if you don't get placed on a jury [source: Philadelphia Courts ]. If you actually serve, you are exempt from jury duty for the next two or three years, depending on the state. After that, you're tossed back in the mix.  Instead of seeing it as a curse, you could be thankful that you even qualify to be called for jury duty. Convicted felons aren't allowed to sit on juries, for example, nor are people with serious physical or mental illnesses [source: U.S. Courts ]. In that way, it's a blessing that you are able to serve your country and its impartial judicial system. We salute you, juror number 178293!  Still not convinced that the system is fair?

By Mona Chalabi  Filed under Dear Mona    Facebook Twitter Email                Jury chairs sit empty inside the courtroom of the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Mark Wilson / Getty Images   Jury chairs sit empty inside the courtroom of the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Mark Wilson / Getty Images      Dear Mona,  How many Americans serve as jurors in an actual trial in their lifetimes? I’m asking because I was just picked to serve in a jury trial for the third time. Most people I know have never had to sit through a trial as a juror. They may have been called for jury duty, but they were usually dismissed the same day. Am I some sort of an exception?  Andrew, 45, Connecticut   Dear Andrew,  In a 2012 survey, 27 percent of U.S. adults said they had served on a jury at some point in their lives. That survey was conducted by DRI, a membership organization for defense lawyers, and was based on only 1,020 interviews — but it’s the best source I can find to answer your question about lifetime jury service. To get more detailed national numbers, I’m going to have to zoom in on a shorter timeframe.  The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) estimates that in a given year, 32 million people get summoned for service — though only 8 million of them actually report for jury duty (there are lots of reasons for that difference, including the 4 million summonses returned by the post office marked as undeliverable and the 3 million people who fail to appear). It’s estimated that only 1.5 million people are eventually selected to serve on a jury in a state court each year. Those numbers, the most recent available, come from a 2007 survey conducted by the NCSC.  NCSC analyst Greg Hurley explained to me that while federal courts are under a unified system that makes data collection pretty easy, “state courts are a different bird.” Their sheer number (there are more than 3,000 U.S. counties, and almost every one has a court), as well as their differing practices in jury selection, makes it impossible to collect state-court-level data without time-consuming and expensive surveys. So, to get more recent and more detailed data, I’m going to have to look at the federal courts. Which is a shame because that data represents a small fraction of all U.S. adults’ experiences of jury service.  Last year, almost 64,000 people were selected for federal jury service in the U.S. — that’s only 0.03 percent of the adult population. If you want to understand the probability of getting selected, you have to use the adult population as your baseline because you have to be at least 18 to serve on a U.S. jury. That’s not the only condition for jury service , though — in fact, the pool of people from which juries can be drawn is considerably smaller than the 238 million adults in America.  To be legally qualified for federal jury service, you also have to be a U.S. citizen, which, according to 2013 estimates from the Census Bureau, brings the number of potential federal jurors down to 218 million adults. Another condition for serving is that, with some exceptions, you can’t have been convicted of a felony — which as of 2010 ruled out about 6 million adults, taking us to 212 million.  And, if your English isn’t proficient enough to satisfactorily complete the juror qualification form, you can’t serve, either — that could affect some of the nearly one in 10 working-age U.S. adults who in 2012 were considered “limited English proficient.” 1  There are even more criteria to be legally qualified for federal jury service than we can get into here — and they’re even more complex to quantify. 2 So I don’t know the number of people who are eligible to be jurors in the U.S., and without that number, I can’t really give you an accurate probability about your chances of getting selected. Please try to keep that in mind as you read on.  Let’s go back for a minute to the number of people who were selected for federal jury service last year. In the 12 months through September 2014, 48,877 adults served in trial juries, according to caseload statistics from the U.S. federal court system. Another estimated 14,879 adults served in grand juries over that period. In the case of grand juries , the federal courts track only the number of grand juries (763 last year) and the number of times jurors report to them (164,856 last year — meaning one juror that attends on five days is counted five times). So to figure out the number of jurors that represents, I had to use an estimate (a federal courts spokeswoman told me in an email, “We know it’s in the range of 12,208-17,549,” so I took the midpoint of that range).  That’s your first clue that those two types of jury are a little different . A trial jury, also known as a petit jury, tends to be smaller than a grand jury. Its purpose is slightly different, too — a trial jury reaches a verdict (either in favor of plaintiff/defendant in a civil case or guilty/not guilty in a criminal case), and a grand jury is tasked with determining whether there is “probable cause” to believe a person has committed a crime. Technically, adding the number of adults who have served on a trial jury and a grand jury is a little simplistic; it’s possible that someone may have served as a juror twice in a given year, but it’s highly improbable. The random selection process makes it unlikely that someone will get called to serve twice — and once you’ve served, the Jury Act also excuses you from federal jury service for the next two years (exception: if you served on a petit trial that lasted less than a month).  Selection is just one part of this story — a whole lot of Americans get called for duty but never witness a trial (people on grand juries don’t witness a trial, so we’ll exclude them here).  In the 12 months through September 2014, a total of 218,203 U.S. citizens were present for federal trial jury selection — but only 22.4 percent of those adults were eventually selected, according to the U.S. courts. Overall then, 0.09 percent of U.S. adults were called to serve on trial juries in 2014, and 0.02 percent ended up serving.  The federal courts are trying to change those numbers, because inviting a potential jury member and then not selecting her is costly. In the federal system, the courts are required to pay prospective jurors $40 a day, whether they’re selected to serve or not. That means wasted juror time costs the federal judiciary hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.  Selection rates don’t just reflect everything about how the court system works — human behavior is a factor, and some people try to maximize or minimize their chances of getting selected to serve once they’re called upon. I won’t even attempt to quantify that for you, though, Andrew — to do so would require data that could be affected by people’s willingness to tell the truth about what they do when they get called for jury duty, not to mention their ability to be aware of their own biases and behavior.  And once you get past the top-line facts about the number of people called and selected, the reality of who serves on a jury is infinitely more complicated. That’s because the details of a case are of huge importance to the attorneys selecting the jury. This interactive graphic by The New York Times does a good job of illustrating how prosecutors and defense lawyers pick jurors. It’s based on a hypothetical scenario where the plaintiff is a woman in her 60s who says she lost money because her investments were mismanaged. As well as occupation, age and income level, the factors that affect a prospective juror’s chances of being selected for that trial include whether she has close family or friends in the finance industry and even whether she likes crossword puzzles. All of which is yet further evidence that understanding the probability of being selected for jury duty involves a lot of variables.  The numbers do show that the chances of getting called in the past 12 months are pretty low. And the fact that you’ve served on three juries now does seem pretty remarkable, Andrew. But maybe you’re the perfect juror. I don’t know anything about you other than your age, state and gender — let alone details about the trials you’ve served on. All those variables could either make it more surprising that you’ve served three times — or a lot less surprising.  Hope the numbers help,  Mona  Have a question you would like answered here?

Footnotes   That term describes people who speak English as a second language and who have rated their ability to speak English as “well,” “not well” or “not at all.”  You must “reside primarily in the judicial district for one year,” “have no disqualifying mental or physical condition” and “not currently be subject to felony charges punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,” according to the federal courts. What’s more, the following groups are exempt from serving: Members of the armed forces on active duty, members of professional fire and police departments; and “public officers” of federal, state or local governments, who are actively engaged full-time in the performance of public duties. In some state courts, there are additional conditions and exemptions for jury service. In Minnesota , for example, those who are older than 70 can ask to be excused, while in Texas , citizens who can’t read and write or who aren’t “of sound mind and good moral character” are disqualified.

While the majority of jury trials last less than a week, jurors can receive up to $50 a day after serving 10 days on a trial. (Employees of the federal government are paid their regular salary in lieu of this fee.) Jurors also are reimbursed for reasonable transportation expenses and parking fees. Jurors also receive a subsistence allowance covering their meals and lodging if they are required to stay overnight.  Your employer may continue your salary during all or part of your jury service, but federal law does not require an employer to do so. Nonetheless, the Jury Act forbids any employer from firing, intimidating, or coercing any permanent employee because of their federal jury service. You should check whether your company or employer has a policy for employees serving on jury duty.  Grand Jury  Federal jurors are paid $40 a day.

How will I know which days to report?  Where did the jury office get my name for jury duty?  I do not reside in the county where the court is located. Do I have to serve?  What are the grounds for requesting an excuse from service?  May I postpone my service to a later date?  What are jurors paid?  Where should I park?  May I bring a cell phone, laptop or pager into the courthouse?  What should I wear?  May I smoke?  Will there be breaks? Are there lunch facilities available?  May I bring my children?  Does my employer have to pay me my normal wages during my jury service?  Can my employer fire or discipline me for not being at work due to jury service?  What if my employer wants proof I was there?  What happens if I fail to appear for jury service?     How long do I serve on jury duty?   Jurors are on call for two weeks (10 consecutive court days beginning the first day you are on call). This court is a “one appearance, one trial” court. You will be required to report only once during your two-week on call period. If you are not selected as a juror when you report, your service will be over when jury selection is complete. If you are selected to serve on a trial, you must serve the length of the trial; when the trial is over, your service is complete.   Top of Page    How will I know which days to report?   You must check for reporting instructions the day before your first scheduled reporting date to find out if or when you are required to appear. If you are not required to appear that first day, the message will tell you when to call again. You must continue calling for instructions until the message says your service is over.   Top of Page    Where did the jury office get my name for jury duty?   Names for potential jurors are randomly drawn from voter registration lists obtained from the Secretary of State of California and from lists of driver's license/identification cards obtained from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.   Top of Page    I do not reside in the county where the court is located. Do I have to serve?   The boundaries of the Northern District of California include the following 15 counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and Sonoma. If you live in any of these counties, you are subject to jury service in one of the court's four locations: San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose or Eureka. Once you are summoned to one location, your service cannot be transferred to any other location.  Note that jurors residing farther than 80 miles from the courthouse may be 
reimbursed for overnight stay(s) in a hotel near the courthouse, as well as meals and incidental expenses, so long as they 
obtain prior authorization from the jury office.  Please call 
415-522-2171 for more information.   Top of Page    What are the grounds for requesting an excuse from service?   You may be excused from service on request if you:   Are 75 years of age or older;  Have reported to court for jury service in the past 12 months. You must have been present in court for at least one day and must provide a certificate of attendance from the other court showing the date(s) you were present;  Are solely responsible for the care of a pre-school child or an aged or infirm person and you are not employed outside the home;  Reside more than 80 miles from the courthouse to which you are summoned;  Serve as a volunteer firefighter or member of a volunteer rescue squad or ambulance crew.   Note that even if you live further than 80 miles from the courthouse, you are welcome to participate as a prospective juror. If your trip to the courthouse would be inconveniently long, you may be eligible to stay at a hotel near the courthouse with court reimbursement, along with payment for meals and incidental expenses, so long as you obtain prior authorization from the jury office.  Please call 
415-522-2171 for more information.     Top of Page    May I postpone my service to a later date?   You may request a one-time postponement of your jury service for up to six months. When you request a postponement, please be prepared to identify a two-week period within the next six months to which your service can be postponed.   Top of Page    What are jurors paid?   Jurors are paid an attendance fee of $40.00 per day. Regardless of means of travel, jurors also receive round-trip mileage from their home to the courthouse at the rate currently authorized by the Internal Revenue Service. The court validates juror parking at specific parking lots near the courthouse and reimburses bridge tolls when applicable.  Jurors residing farther than 80 miles from the courthouse may be 
reimbursed for lodging in a hotel near the 
courthouse, along with meals and incidental expenses, so long
 as they 
obtain prior authorization from the jury office.  Please call 
415-522-2171 for more information.   Top of Page    Where should I park?   The jury summons includes the addresses of parking lots in the vicinity of the courthouse where the court validates parking. You must bring your parking stub to the jury office for validation. If you park at any lot other than those listed, the court will not be able to validate your ticket; the court will not reimburse you for parking expenses incurred at lots not listed unless parking at the listed lots is for some reason impossible. Metered street parking should be avoided as there will not be regular opportunities to leave the courthouse during the day to feed parking meters.   Top of Page    May I bring a cell phone, laptop or pager into the courthouse?   Yes. Jurors are allowed to bring these devices into the courthouse. Electronic devices must be turned off in courtrooms and whenever the judge so orders. Jurors are expected to be courteous of fellow jurors and court staff by keeping conversation volumes low. Photography is prohibited in the courthouse at all times.   Top of Page    What should I wear?   Jurors should dress comfortably. “Business casual” attire is generally appropriate. Very casual attire such as tank tops, halters, shorts, flip-flops and the like are not appropriate. A sweater or light jacket is recommended as the courtrooms can get cold.   Top of Page    May I smoke?   Smoking is prohibited within the courthouse and within 25 feet of any doorway. Smoking is permitted in outdoor areas 25 feet or more from courthouse doorways. Smoking materials must be disposed of properly.   Top of Page    Will there be breaks? Are there lunch facilities available?   There will be comfort breaks at appropriate times during the proceedings.  Jurors are welcome to bring lunch and there is a refrigerator and microwave available for juror use in each courthouse.  In the San Francisco courthouse, the following food service options are available to the public (and an ATM machine is located on the second floor):   A cafeteria on the second floor of the Federal Building, Café 450, serves breakfast and lunch;  A snack and sandwich shop on the 10th floor, the Midway Café, is open until 4:00 p.m.;  A coffee cart is located on the second floor, serving coffee, tea and specialty drinks.   In the Oakland courthouse, a cafeteria is located on the fifth floor of the South Tower, The Tasty Lunchstop Café, serving breakfast, lunch and snacks. Hours: 6:00 a.m. - 3:25 p.m.  Restaurants are also available within a short walking distance of all the courthouses.   Top of Page    May I bring my children?   No. You should not bring your children to court as there are no facilities for them.   Top of Page    Does my employer have to pay me my normal wages during my jury service?   No, there is no law requiring employers to pay employees for the time they miss while performing jury service. If you are paid your normal wages, your employer may require you to turn over the attendance fee that the court pays you.   Top of Page    Can my employer fire or discipline me for not being at work due to jury service?   No. Pursuant to Title 28, U.S.C. § 1875, “No employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any permanent employee by reason of such employee's jury service, or the attendance or scheduled attendance in connection with such service, in any court of the United States.”   Top of Page    What if my employer wants proof I was there?   Certificates of attendance are available on a daily basis.   Top of Page    What happens if I fail to appear for jury service?   Any person who fails to report for jury duty may be served with an order to show cause. The court may then hold a hearing on the order to show cause. A juror who fails to show adequate cause for the absence can be held in contempt of court under the Jury Selection Act. The penalty can be a fine of up to $1,000, up to three days imprisonment, a term of community service, or any combination of these.

individual must:  be a United States citizen;  be at least 18 years of age;  reside primarily in the judicial district for one year;  be adequately proficient in English to satisfactorily complete the juror qualification form;  have no disqualifying mental or physical condition;  not currently be subject to felony charges punishable by imprisonment for more than one year; and  never have been convicted of a felony (unless civil rights have been legally restored)   There are three groups that are exempt from federal jury service:  members of the armed forces on active duty;  members of professional fire and police departments; and  "public officers" of federal, state or local governments, who are actively engaged full-time in the performance of public duties.   Persons employed on a full-time basis in any of these categories are barred from serving on federal juries, even if they desire to do so.  Excuses from Jury Service  Each of the 94 federal district courts maintains its own jury procedures and policies regarding excuses from jury service. Many courts offer excuses from service, on individual request, to designated groups of persons or occupational classes. Such groups may include persons over age 70; persons who have, within the past two years, served on a federal jury; and persons who serve as volunteer fire fighters or members of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.  The Jury Act also allows courts to excuse a juror from service at the time he or she is summoned on the grounds of "undue hardship or extreme inconvenience." The juror should write a letter to the clerk of court requesting an excuse with an explanation of hardship.  Excuses for jurors are granted at the discretion of the court and cannot be reviewed or appealed to Congress or any other entity.

It's maybe 10% here.  Dress like you're going to a school or better. I avoid having shoes with metal and leave my pocket change in the car to breeze thru metal detectors.  Most trials only last 2 or 3 days if you do get picked. Sometimes you just sit there in the assembly room and finally someone comes in and says "they settled, thank you for your service."         ryan foreman     RE: Jury duty tommorow - what are my chances of being selected?  12/14/2010 5:32PM - in reply to potential jury dude  ryan foreman      Reply   Return to Index   Report Post  It may depend on the state you live but the lawyers will likely ask you a question or two.

Just say that you would favor one side over the other for some reason (personal experience, etc.) and then tell the judge/lawyers that in all honesty you would be biased and would not be fair.  If that doesn't work, tell them that you don't recognize the court because it is supported by money that the government takes by force from you.         My gf has a Whooty!

My personal experience is that I unfortunately made it to the last round of questions to a case I didn't want to sit in on (murder case which was projected to take around a month or more).  I just blurted out "I'm racist" before they even asked me their first question.  I was asked to leave the court room and obviously didn't serve.

You should be able to opt out of jury duty for life. In exchange, you waive your right to trial by jury if charges are ever brought against you. I think that this would be fair. If you don't want to participate in the process, you don't have to. However, you aren't going to choose not to participate in the process when it is inconvenient to do so and then swear that it is your right to have the very same process protect you when it becomes beneficial.         trollism     RE: Jury duty tommorow - what are my chances of being selected?  12/15/2010 11:35AM - in reply to Bear of Bad News  trollism      Reply   Return to Index   Report Post  I enjoyed jury duty.

Mona Chalabi of FiveThirtyEight.com joins NPR's Rachel Martin for a look at who those people are.       UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Fifty-two.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 11:53.  UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Twenty-five.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: 6.11.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Twenty-five thousand eight hundred and forty-two.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Time now for some number crunching from our data expert Mona Chalabi from fivethirtyeight.com. She has given us this number of the week.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: 32 million.  MARTIN: That's the number of people who get summoned each year for jury duty in U.S. state courts. Mona Chalabi has been looking closely at the number of Americans who get called upon to serve on a jury. Hey, Mona.  MONA CHALABI: Hi, Rachel.  MARTIN: So what made you start looking into this particular number?  CHALABI: Well, it actually came as a question from a reader. I write a column as a kind of statistical Dear Abby. This one reader, Andrew, who's 45 and lives in Connecticut, he got in touch to tell me that he had served on multiple juries and wanted to know whether or not that's unusual. So I started to look for some national data. And I came across that number that you mentioned - 32 million. And that's the number of Americans that get summoned each year. The number comes from a 2007 survey by the National Center for State Courts. They surveyed over a thousand local courts and almost 12,000 judges and lawyers to get to that number.  MARTIN: OK.  CHALABI: But the problem is is that I don't have any more recent data since 2007 beyond that one particular survey. It's incredibly hard to collect data from these state courts because there are so many of them and because their practices differ so widely from place to place.  MARTIN: All right, so based on what you do know, is it possible to figure out how many people actually show up for jury duty because it's one thing to get a summons in the mail, but you know, getting to the courthouse is sometimes another.  CHALABI: Yeah, absolutely. The number is far lower than that 32 million we started with. So based on the same survey that comes from these guys, they found that each year, the state court summoned 32 million people, but when it comes to actually showing up, only 8 million people actually report for jury service. And there's lots of reasons why that number reduces from 32 million to 8 million including the 4 million summonses that are returned by the post office marked as undeliverable, the 3 million people that get excused for financial or medical hardship and another 3 million that simply fail to show up.  MARTIN: Three million people just don't come, wow, OK.  CHALABI: Yeah. Exactly.  MARTIN: OK, so 8 million people report for service. Do we know anything about the numbers of those folks who actually get selected for juries?  CHALABI: Yeah, it's even smaller still. So we're down to about 1.5 million Americans each year.  MARTIN: All right, understanding that the details of any particular case will determine the kinds of jurors the attorneys are looking for, is there a kind of person who is more likely to get selected for juries?  CHALABI: Absolutely, but that person will vary depending on the nature of the trial, which is why the math behind this is so difficult. To illustrate that, The New York Times actually created this interactive that shows how many different factors are at play. So it presents you with a hypothetical scenario. In this case, you're a potential juror in a case where the plaintiff is a woman in her 60s. The woman says she's lost money because her investments were mismanaged. Then the interactive asks you dozens of questions, and some of them are things that you might expect anyway, like occupation, age and income level. But then there are also things that are so particular to the case, things like do you have close friends or family in the finance industry and even whether you like crossword puzzles. And if you think about that in terms of variables that I would need to quantify to work out the kinds of people likely to be selected, you start to see that in terms of mathematical probabilities, this is incredibly difficult to understand.  MARTIN: So you're basically saying you're off the hook, right? Like, there's no way that you can tell us the odds of any one of us getting selected for jury duty. All right, fine.  CHALABI: (Laughter) I'm sorry, I really did try.  MARTIN: (Laughter) That's OK. It's our civic duty, we should say. Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight.com. Thanks so much, Mona.  CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel.  (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "54-46 WAS MY NUMBER")  TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS: (Singing) 54-46, that's my number. 54-46 that's my number.  Copyright © 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A reader has been told he must serve as a juror for the fifth time. He’s happy to do so, but repeated summons anger others            Patrick Collinson   Sat 20 Aug 2016 01.59 EDT   Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 11.08 EST           Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email                  View more sharing options      Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger           Close                                                   T wo years ago a reader contacted Guardian Money after being summoned for a fourth time to serve on a jury. Now he has been called up again – and wonders if five trips to the jury box is something of a record.  Robert Smith*, 64, says he has enjoyed his previous stints in court and sees it as his civic duty, which he is proud to undertake. But it has left him scratching his head as to why he is called so often.  Plenty of people go through their lives never being summoned; others are called repeatedly. Is selection really, as the government says, entirely random, or is something else at work here?      Why our jury system can be guilty of inflexibility | Letters           Read more       In 2015 there were 361,300 juror summons issued in England and Wales, but the number who actually sat on a jury was just 179,200. With the two nations having a total population of 57.8 million, it means the chances of serving are relatively slim. The Ministry of Justice declined to give figures on the likelihood of being summoned, but a BBC Scotland analysis found that the probability of being asked to serve is just 40% over a lifetime.  That makes Smith’s five summons very rare. The MoJ says that if you are called within two years of the last time you served you have an automatic right to be excused. Smith’s latest summons is almost exactly two years after his last.  Numerous theories abound on the internet as to why some people are called to serve and others not. Some believe they are blacklisted because they have an Irish heritage (dating back to IRA terrorism days), or that they were once a member of CND. Others believe a letter to the courts suggesting you are a “hanger and flogger” will get you off the hook. Some reckon they have been picked because they have been at the same address or same job for years on end and are a conservative, reliable type.  The reality is rather more dull. The Jury Central Summoning Bureau (JCSB) randomly chooses names from the electoral register. It is under no requirement to call people who are a representative cross-section of society – which is why, in theory, it is possible to have juries which are entirely male or female. According to the MoJ, no attempt is made to balance gender, age or ethnicity. It is as random as the prize number generator for premium bonds. Some people hold premium bonds all their life and win nothing, others win again and again.  Smith says those summoned should prize the experience. “I found it really interesting. Some days it can be immensely frustrating, other days rather boring, and sometimes it’s very harrowing. I see it as a citizenship thing – that is, a duty for those called – and should be a source of pride. Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I’ve been with 12 men and women good and true, and they have been an absolute pleasure to work with.”  Smith acknowledges that he has been 23 years at the same address, but he adds that his first summons was at an earlier address in another London borough. It means he has seen the inside of more crown courts than most career criminals.  Ironically, before Smith became semi-retired he worked in HR, and would regularly write letters to the courts asking for an employee to be excused from jury service. “I worked in a big bank, and some staff were under huge pressure. Often it wasn’t them but their managers who would insist that they could not spare the two weeks out of the office.”  Back in the 1980s and 1990s such letters worked, but today the courts are less keen to excuse people. “They gradually got much tougher about it because everyone was doing it. You can understand why – I think the problem was that juries started to be largely made up of retired people and the unemployed.”         Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I’ve been with 12 men and women good and true    Actually, the figures for excusals remain relatively high: of the 361,300 summons in 2015, 27% were excused – up one percentage point on the year earlier.  Some people are automatically excluded from a summons. You’re not wanted if you’re over 70 or under 18. Neither can you serve if you have been in prison in the past 10 years. But other than that, you’ll need a “good reason” why you are unavailable for the next 12 months, otherwise you will simply be deferred and called again at a later date.  Grounds for excusal include:  • You can’t speak or understand English  • You have responsibilities as a carer  • Your excusal would cause “unusual hardship” for your business  • You are a member of the armed forces and your absence would be prejudicial to the efficiency of the service  Most other excuses are treated as reasons to defer, not to avoid, jury service. It used to be the case that “officials” such as police officers, MPs and judges could gain automatic excusal, but those days are gone – police officers who know a particular court well are simply sent to be jurors at other courts outside their working area, while MPs are allowed to avoid jury service in their constituency but will be expected to attend elsewhere. You can even find yourself on a jury sitting next to a judge. They are only excused if they are known to parties involved in the trial. Other than that, they have to turn up, too.  Much more commonly, you can delay jury service but only once, and you have to say when you will be available over the next 12 months.  The main grounds for deferral are:  • You have a holiday booked  • You are having an operation  • You are a teacher and it is exam time  • You are a taking a temporary job (eg a university student during summer) that you’d lose if forced to attend court  The most common complaints about jury service come from young mothers and the self-employed. Mumsnet forums are alive with complaints from mothers with pre-school children. “The accompanying bumf says they pay £32.47 per day for any childcare costs incurred … round here that would just about pay for three hours’ worth of babysitting,” says one, while another says, “I just completed eight days of jury service (in Scotland) and, despite having three pre-schoolers, I was not excused.”                        Don’t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random. Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS via Getty Images   The £32.47 is the fee paid by the courts as expenses to jurors who serve four hours or under, for 10 days or fewer. The figure rises to £64.95 for more than four hours a day, then goes up the longer the case lasts. The courts will also pay £5.71 a day for food and drink.  Many self-employed argue that £64.95 is hardly enough to cover their losses and, what’s more, the person has to provide evidence of loss of earnings before the sum is paid out. Last year, research by Churchill Home Insurance found that one in 20 employers refused to pay their staff if they undertook jury service, while a third stopped after five days. There is no legal obligation for firms to pay employees while on jury service.  Boredom is perhaps a bigger issue for many who are called up. Much of the time a juror spends in crown court is in a room waiting to be called. The MoJ is trying to tackle this, saying its “juror utilisation rate” has rise by 12% since 2006 to around 71%. But that still means a lot of people spending a lot of time twiddling their thumbs.  Typically, jurors are required to be available for 10 days, but sometimes longer. The MoJ says: “The court will always call more people than may be needed to ensure they have enough people when the juries are being picked. Most jurors are called for approximately 10 working days. During this time you could sit on a number of juries covering a wide range of trials; however this cannot be guaranteed.”  If you are called for a trial, 15 of you will be led into the court room, with 12 eventually selected. But don’t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random to sit on the jury. Only then will you find out if you are on a fascinating trial or something rather more dull. And don’t ever think about skipping service – a juror in Leeds who failed to turn up at court, saying “I can’t be bothered, it’s really boring”, was arrested for contempt of court , while another was fined £100 for filing her nails and reading a magazine while hearing a case. The judge called her behaviour “disgraceful”.  * Robert Smith is not his real name    Topics     Consumer affairs        features         Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email           Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger               Reuse this content                            View all comments >            Order by    newest    oldest    recommendations      Show 25    25    50    100    All      Threads    collapsed    expanded    unthreaded       Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Jury duty is mostly a local matter and each jurisdiction will have its own procedures for calling people and how long they need to serve.  There is also Federal jury duty, but that likely varies throughout each part of the country.  Federal jury duty pays a lot better than local jury duty I believe. And if you really want to cash in, look for a Federal grand jury summons.  Of course, you may have to take 6 months off from work to listen to evidence about some incredibly dull white collar crime case.

Back east was called up several times, and once spent nine months on a grand jury, but only one day a week. Since moving out west 11 years ago, haven't been called once, which is OK by me.

This is compiled regularly (every 1-2 years or so I think) by the Sheriff's office by random sampling from the electoral roll.

I believe they pull jury members out of selective service files and voter registries. However, I'm 24 and have never been called even though I've been registered to vote since 18, so in many cases it is a crap shoot.

Before that, I think it was about 2 years, so it seems that 4½ years would be a good figure for time between Jury Duty calls. I sent them a FAX to tell them that I no longer live in Florida.    __________________  A committee is a thing which takes a week to do what one good man can do in an hour. ~Elbert Hubbard       Reply With Quote            robcaro   View Public Profile  Find all posts by robcaro                                   # 10     12-04-2005, 06:36 PM            ltfire     Guest       Join Date: Dec 2002  Location: E 161 St. and River Ave.  Posts: 1,765               The last time I was called, I spent the day hanging out and was finally dismissed because the defendant copped a plea. The Woman running things said see you in four years, as I was leaving. When I got home, I checked my records, and, sure enough it had been four years since my last call. They seem to run through the adult population of my County over a four year timetable, I guess.

That was 30 years ago and I haven't been called since. My step daughter on the other hand has received 3 of them, all for a county she does not live. And my state, like many others, no longer use the registered voter roles to obtain jurists, they use the state driver's license and ID databases.

Compton, California court.  Not bad, actually.  We heard a simple case of resisting arrest and found the defendant not guilty after a half hour of deliberation.  We were told our names were chosen from the roll of registered voters and the list of automobile registrations, and that we can expect to get called on again in about a year.

Actually, many jurisdictions are moving away from using exclusivly the voter registration files for this, fearing that it discourages people from voting.  Often they use other govt files, like driver registration files, or tax files (weeding out corporate/business taxpayers), or even government assistance files (weeding out non-citizens).  But most of them use these in addition to voter registration files, since those are probably the best -- they contain ONLY people of legal age, mental competence, and citizens.  So no need for a weeding-out process at all.

(more than 10 years ago now)  I had actually recieved a summons for a date that had already passed at my college mailbox.  I called the number listed, and said that I didn't live in that county, and had not recieved the notice prior to the date.  They told me not to worry about it.  The time I actually had to go, I had the time to sit on a jury, but alas, all the cases settled prior to needing the jurors, so we were sent home after lunch.  Too bad, as I really did want to serve on a jury.  I've not recieved a summons yet in NH, nor has my wife (that I'm aware of).  She'd be unlikely to be chosen, as she's a paralegal, and from what I've heard, they don't really like folks like her on juries.  I'm registered to vote, drive, and own a car... not sure why I've not been called, but as I don't get paid for time that I don't work, I'd rather not be called at the moment.  -Butler     Reply With Quote            butler1850   View Public Profile  Find all posts by butler1850                     # 16     12-05-2005, 10:58 AM            Neptunian Slug     Guest       Join Date: Jun 2005  Posts: 1,146                 Quote:     Originally Posted by psychonaut   I'm 27 and have never been called for jury duty.

Some key points I remember:  the main list is from voter registration, driver's license lists and property ownership lists  a "formula" such as "every 27th person" or "start with # 12 and and every 30th person after that" is run on the whole list, and those people get a questionaire to fill out and return.  Of the ones who returned the questionaire, some are weeded out  due to being disqualified for some reason, such as age, disability, recent prior jury duty  The ones that don't return the questionaire, get some sort of Stern Letter (I didn't ask further questions.)  Between local and Federal, I've been called 4 times, but only on one jury.

The judge told us that people who showed up tend to get called more frequently, It's been just about a year, and nothing yet.

That explains how I was called three times in six years, while my wife has never been called.  More proof why there's no good statistical way to determine how likely you are to be called.    __________________  I'm not just a hack writer -- I'm a hack author      Reply With Quote            kunilou   View Public Profile  Find all posts by kunilou                 Reply         Bookmarks      del.icio.us    Digg    Facebook    Google    reddit    StumbleUpon    Twitter         «  Previous Thread | Next Thread  »       Thread Tools        Show Printable Version   Email this Page       Display Modes        Linear Mode   Switch to Hybrid Mode   Switch to Threaded Mode                 Posting Rules       You may not post new threads  You may not post replies  You may not post attachments  You may not edit your posts   BB code is On  Smilies are On  [IMG] code is Off  HTML code is Off   Forum Rules               Forum Jump    User Control Panel  Private Messages  Subscriptions  Who's Online  Search Forums  Forums Home    Main  About This Message Board  Comments on Cecil's Columns/Staff Reports  General Questions  Great Debates  Elections  Cafe Society  The Game Room  Thread Games  In My Humble Opinion (IMHO)  Mundane Pointless Stuff I Must Share (MPSIMS)  Marketplace  The BBQ Pit                          All times are GMT -5.

In my limited experience, this is fairly common in the US, with most people getting called in and some doing it multiple times. This is a common television trope. Americans could you confirm/deny this?  In Canada, in my experience, this is incredibly rare. I only know this one person who has ever served. I know many senior citizens who have never served. Canadians, am I living in a bubble or is it really rare to get called in for jury duty?  Assuming my two assumptions are true, what gives? Why is jury duty so much more common in the States? I know we have different legal systems, but am pretty ignorant of the differences. Perhaps we have far fewer jury hearings? Perhaps we have far fewer trials per capita? That's my guess.  Anyway, I'd love some insight. Thanks.

It happened to me once in 30 years - and then was cancelled. Apparently it was a game of chicken between he defense and the crown over a plea deal, and within a few weeks, someone caved with a month to go.  My wife got called once too, recently - and excused when she asked how it would affect her night course committment.  In Canada the laws were amended to remove that pesky option that our peers can ensure justice is done; I've gotten in trouble on other threads for misstating the details, but I believe the current law says that a jury trial is only an option if the maximum sentence is 5 years or more. IIRC, this happened about the time of Trudeau.  there's also the option of a jury trial depending on how the charges are laid IIRC, I'm sure a Canadian lawyer can chime in with the exact details.  So where the Americans often have jury trials over the most trivial of offenses, Canadian crown prosecutors are insulated from having to allow the real world sentiments of the general public infuse the courtroom with common sense.  (I also suspect that a lot of cases are filed as the less serious charges simply to avoid having to allow a perp the opportunity of a jury trial.)  However, Stephen Harper may manage to change this system if he follows through on his threat/promise to make far more crimes result in higher sentences.  Also, if you do not live near one of the larger cities where these major trials are usually heard, you may also not be summoned for jury duy.

In the US, the majority of jury trials nowadays are for civil cases, not criminal.  The US is more litigious than Canada, which is probably a factor.     A lot of the litigation in the USA starts on the premise that, on top of everything else, you owe me a huge amount for medical bills.  Not a problem in Canada, virtually no medical bills. You have an acident, what are you going to sue for? IIRC, pain and suffering is not a big money-maker in Canada. Plus, most law societies are hostile to the idea of contingency fees, so you need to be able to afford a lawyer; and if you lose, you pay the other guy's legal bills in almost every case - something the USA should do.  It encourages careful examination of the case before filing.  I recall a class-action attempt a few years ago where the judge basically told the group unless they could post a bond for the amount of the other side's potential legal bills, he would disallow the case, since it was pretty weak to start with.

It was for a limited time (three months, I think) and got called for jury selection just once in that time, and the jury was selected before my number was called. There were about 150 of us in the pool, so the odds of getting picked for actual duty were quite small.

I know a large number of people that have been called but excused due to their occupation, student status, politics, personal reasons, etc.. Most public servants, doctors, nurses, teachers, etc. are excused because they would best serve the public good remaining at their place of employment.  I quite enjoyed my term on a jury but one of my benefits is paid leave while on jury duty, I really sympathized with other jurors who were forced to be there but were losing pay at their own jobs, especially as the trial dragged on and we were almost sequestered for our deliberations.

IIRC, this happened about the time of Trudeau.     Yes, you've got in trouble before on this topic, not because of minor disagreements about details, but because you're flat out WRONG!  Here's my post from the previous thread where you stated your WRONG opinions as facts:    Quote:     Originally Posted by Northern Piper    Quote:     Originally Posted by md2000   (IANAL...) Pierre Trudeau's government basically eliminated the right to a jury trial unless the offense(s) charged was punishable by 7 years or more, IIRC. The commentary at the time was that jury trials were too difficult and expensive, and juries did not always do what the prosecutor wanted; while judges were less likely to be swayed from the letter of the law by details like sympathy and common decency, aka natural justice     md2000 , your comment is simply nonsensical and wrong.  The Criminal Code provides that offences can be prosecuted in one of two ways: by summary conviction, or by indictment.  The two main differences between summary conviction and indictment are in the penalty and in the manner of trial. If the Crown proceeds by way of summary conviction, the trial is by judge alone, in the Provincial Court. However, the general rule is that the maximum jail time is six months, as set out in s. 787(1) of the Code :    Quote:     General penalty  787. (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, everyone who is convicted of an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or to both.    Thus, if the Crown is seeking a penalty of more than six months' imprisonment, the Crown must proceed by way of indictment.  The basic principle for trials by indictment is set out in s. 471 of the Code :    Quote:     Trial by jury compulsory  471. Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, every accused who is charged with an indictable offence shall be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury.     (My underlining.)  So, the starting point for charges where the accused faces more than six months' imprisonment is that the trial will be by jury.  Now, that doesn't mean that all trials on indictment will actually be by jury, because the Code gives the accused, not the Crown, the power to elect trial by judge alone.  This principle is set out in s. 536 of the Code , which provides:    Quote:     536 (2) If an accused is before a justice charged with an indictable offence, other than an offence listed in section 469, and the offence is not one over which a provincial court judge has absolute jurisdiction under section 553, the justice shall, after the information has been read to the accused, put the accused to an election in the following words:  You have the option to elect to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a preliminary inquiry;  or you may elect to be tried by a judge without a jury;  or you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury .   If you do not elect now, you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury.  If you elect to be tried by a judge without a jury or by a court composed of a judge and jury or if you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, you will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the prosecutor requests one. How do you elect to be tried?  (My indents and underlining to help make a block of text more readable).  So, it's up to the accused to elect not to have a trial by judge and jury, not the Crown. And if the accused fails to make an election, the default is again a trial by judge and jury.  (The reference to offences listed in s. 469, by the way, refers to the most serious offences, such as murder, which must be tried in the superior court. It is possible to have a trial by judge alone in those cases as well, but only if both the accused and the Crown consent to trial by judge alone; see s. 473(1) .).  Thus, the basic principle of Canadian criminal procedure is that in cases where the accused is facing more than six months' imprisonment, the accused has the right to a jury trial. The accused can waive that right, but the Crown cannot take away the accused's right to a jury.  There is only one case where the Crown can override the accused's election with respect to manner of trial, but it goes the other way: if the accused is facing more than 5 years' imprisonment and has elected trial by judge alone, the Attorney General can require that the trial be by judge and jury, as set out in s. 568 :    Quote:     Attorney General may require trial by jury  568. Even if an accused elects under section 536 or re-elects under section 561 or subsection 565(2) to be tried by a judge or provincial court judge, as the case may be, the Attorney General may require the accused to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury unless the alleged offence is one that is punishable with imprisonment for five years or less. If the Attorney General so requires, a judge or provincial court judge has no jurisdiction to try the accused under this Part and a preliminary inquiry must be held if requested under subsection 536(4), unless one has already been held or the re-election was made under subsection 565(2).    So, far from giving the Crown the power to deny the accused a right to a jury, the Code says that in certain cases the Attorney General may insist on a trial by jury.  And what does Pierre Trudeau have to do with any of this? well, nothing with respect to these provisions of the Criminal Code. They aren't new - they were the law before he became Prime Minister and continued to be so after he left office, without any change.  The only thing Mr Trudeau had to do with jury trials was to ensure that the right to a jury trial is enshrined in the Constitution, in s. 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms :    Quote:     Proceedings in criminal and penal matters  11. Any person charged with an offence has the right ... (f) except in the case of an offence under military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or a more severe punishment;    In other words, Mr Trudeau turned what had been a statutory right to a jury into a constitutional right, to bar Parliament from taking away the right to a jury trial, in cases where the potential punishment is more than 5 years.  Hardly the action of someone with "Dictatorial tendencies" - to entrench the right to a jury trial in the Constitution.        So to summarise:  1. The Charter guarantees the right to a jury trial for any offence where the penalty is more than 5 years;  2. Parliament has gone further than the constitutional minimum and has provided that anyone who tried by indictment (generally speaking, an offence carrying more than six months imprisonment) has a right to a jury;  3. A jury trial is the default for indictable matters;  4. It's the right of the accused to elect not to have a jury trial in indictable matters;  5. The Crown cannot take away the right to a jury;  in certain cases, the Crown can compel a jury trial;  6. Trudeau did not take away any rights  to a jury trial;  he entrenched the right to a jury for offences of more than 5 years' imprisonment in the Charter, as a constitutional guarantee.   md2000 , please stop spreading misinformation!

There are no civil jury trials in either the Federal Court or the Province of Quebec.  In all the other provinces and territories, there is a right to a jury trial in some civil matters, and it is an option in some other civil matters.

In other Canadian provinces, an attorney may collect a percentage of recovery in case of a victory but must charge an hourly fee otherwise.    To those four provinces specifically mentioned, I would add Saskatchewan, which also allows contingency fees.  When you add those five provinces together, they have 89.1% of the Canadian population (Source: Wikipedia:  List of Canadian Provinces and Territories by Population ), so contingency fees are  very common in Canada.

The first of these is that the significant majority of criminal matters are heard in lower level or provincial courts. These courts never sit with a jury, and hear matters of summary jurisdiction (sentences including an option of up to six months custody), or hybrid offences where the Crown has chosen to proceed by indictment (which can be heard by a Superior or Queen's Bench court, and may involve a jury), but where the accused has elected to have the matter heard in provincial court.  Typically, a common reason accused persons choose trial in provincial court (where the choice exists) is that they want the matter resolved more quickly - usually because they are in custody having been denied bail. Superior court level trials - especially jury trials - take far longer to come to hearing.  Where a matter proceeds to trial in Superior court, many accused choose trial before a judge sitting without a jury because their defence involves or centres around a question of law, or an alleged breach of the Charter rights of the accused. Even where a jury is sitting, a Charter challenge is something a judge alone determines; and they can be determinative of whether a case continues.  For example, a suspected drug dealer is pulled over by police, is questioned and searched, and has his car searched and drugs are found. He is then arrested. Defence will argue that the police violated the accused's Charter rights by detaining him without telling him why, or informing him of his rights upon detention, and searching the vehicle without justification. If the Court finds that any or all of these actions have breached the rights of the accused, one of the remedies to this is to exclude any evidence seized as a result of the breach. No drugs = no case. Often, this is the only "defence" an accused can raise, thus if no breach is found, or one is found but the drugs are still admitted as evidence, the accused typically will then enter a guilty plea.  Jury trials in Canada are usually chosen in matters where the accused is trying to elicit a degree of sympathy from the jury (provocation, honest mistake, etc.) or where they are angling for a lesser conviction (manslaughter vs. murder, 2nd degree vs. 1st degree murder, etc.). This choice is almost exclusively the right of the accused. There is only one avenue where the Crown can force a jury trial, and that is the case of a direct indictment, where the accused spends no time in provincial court, and all proceedings are initiated and occur in Superior court. Direct indictments are a comparative rarity, and even then it is not unheard of for the Crown to consent to a direct indictment matter being heard by a judge sitting alone.  In my personal experience, jury trials are typically much harder and time consuming to conduct, and are also fraught with more opportunity for errors leading to appeals. When you combine that with the fact that so many of those chosen for jury duty try all manner of excuses to get out of serving, the ratio of judge & jury to judge alone seems to be about right.

I'm 60 and I've only been on a jury once.  Two or three other times I received a postcard notifying me to call the county courthouse the night before a particular day to see if I would have to go to the courthouse to be considered for being a juror, but those two or three times I got a recorded message when I called that I didn't have to report on that particular day.

Posts: 25,958                Spare Me 's summary of the practicalities counting towards judge alone and away from jury trials in criminal matters strike me as accurate.  For civil matters, there's the fact that jury trials tend to be longer, which adds to the expense.  In civil matters the loser pays the winner's court costs, which includes costs of the jury and the associated longer trial costs, which is one factor counting against jury trials in civil matters.

At least under the US constitution; individual states can have stricter requirments and many require a jury trial if there's any possibility of a custodial sentence at all.

I did some research on jury trials awhile back and came across the interesting fact that an estimated 90% of all jury trials in the world are in the U.S.  The deprivation of trial by jury was a key complaint against King George III, and it's always been a very important part of our court system.  I dealt with juries as a prosecutor many times, and have done so a handful of times as a magistrate.  I'd love to serve on a jury someday but have just never had the chance.  My wife and I are both about the same age and have been registered voters for almost 30 years.  I've been called exactly once in all that time, and was excused as unneeded without ever setting foot in the courtroom.  My wife has been summoned twice, each time after the birth of one of our children, and was likewise excused.  Most civil cases in the U.S. are settled before trial, and most criminal cases result in a plea agreement before trial.  Of those which actually go to trial, relatively few do so before a jury.  But you never know, and it's nice to have it as an option.  I'll let G.K.

Since civil matters in Québec don't use jury trials, getting a jury summons here tends to cause a small amount of fear because you know it's going to be a criminal matter and you really, really hope it isn't a long trial about [that gory/upsetting/truly depraved thing] you heard on the news a while back.  I got called back in September and was told to "be available", whatever that meant, for the fall session (until the end of November). I was told to go to the court house once, where I sat around for 8 hours and did absolutely nothing at all other than chat with other people. I never got called to talk to anyone, and at the end of the day they announced that they had a jury and I got sent home. I got reimbursed for my Subway sandwich lunch and $6 for transit, although I had a bus pass at a discounted rate (yay,  profit!).  Since I didn't even speak to anyone official - only a "bonjour" to the woman who handed me an instruction sheet - I never got to find out whether having a cousin who is an RCMP detective in the region was enough to get me out of jury duty. Though I was unemployed and bored at the time, and I kind of wanted to serve, just to do something!

I still don't understand, like the OP, why the ratio - real or perceived - of jury trials is so much much lower in Canada. There are a huge number of cases invlving crimes where sentence is over 6 months, just like the USA, but it rarely seems they are jury trials unless its a very high profile case.  Is the choice of jury the prosecutors' choice or always the defendant's choice in the USA and Canada?

There was a trial of a juror for obstruction of justice several years ago where I live and that was one of the talking points on the radio.  This may contribute to the perception that juries are less common (ie they can't talk to the media, so the media don't pay as much attention to them).

The judge carefully read through the evidence, stated the facts that he accepted, and rendered the verdict.  The entire verdict took about 90 minutes to read.  Not as dramatic as the jury filing back into the courtroom and saying, "We the jury find the accused..." perhaps; but unlike with a jury, the judge's reasoning was plain to see (hear?).  Perhaps that's one advantage to a "judge alone" trial: the way the judge arrives at a decision is laid bare.

In Ohio, the law now strongly favors jury service by all.  Judges, magistrates and lawyers of all kinds may serve on juries.  (A very liberal judge served as foreman of a criminal trial jury a few years ago and, much to everyone's surprise, joined their unanimous verdict of guilty).  The trial judges in such cases will usually give a special instruction that the legally-trained juror is not to unduly influence the jury, instruct them in the law, dominate discussion, etc., and moreover must accept the instructions of law provided by the trial judge.    Quote:     Originally Posted by Spoons    ...Perhaps that's one advantage to a "judge alone" trial: the way the judge arrives at a decision is laid bare.     Not necessarily.  In Ohio, a judge customarily will give at least a brief explanation of why he or she decided upon guilt or innocence, but is not required to.  And a particular sentence need not be explained unless the judge goes higher than the recommended sentence for that particular offense.

In Canada a judge is required to give reasons and can be overturned on appeal if the reasons do not provide a sufficient basis for meaningful appellate review.

Sentencing in the matter whose verdict I attended today has been adjourned until next week.  This will give the Crown and the defence time to prepare sentencing arguments--necessary, given the verdict.  In a nutshell, the accused was on trial for second-degree murder.  The judge found that the necessary mens rea for that charge was not made out by the Crown; but as there was still a deceased at the end of the fight between the accused and the deceased, a manslaughter conviction was appropriate.  This was unexpected, but not entirely so.  Given the verdict of manslaughter, however, I would expect both sides to require time to do research and to prepare sentencing arguments appropriate to the conviction.  I will try to attend at the sentencing hearing next week.  Should anybody be interested, I would be happy to post an update (if I can make it to the sentencing hearing, that is).

More apropos to the thread, I will say that prior to my attendance at law school, I was called for jury service twice.  Once was the coroner's jury I referred to upthread; the other was shortly after I moved across country (and was thus ineligible in the requesting jurisdiction anyway).  Now, as a fully-licensed lawyer, I am barred for life from jury service in Canada.

Call your local Board of Elections, or the local courts, to ask about that.  Once you're in the jury pool, my understanding is that who will be part of the jury is determined by lot - at least that's how my experience was.  So I don't think you can actually finagle your way into an actual jury.

I don't think a broad education is considered a liability, but specific knowledge germaine to a case might be because both sides figure your mind is made up from your training and isn't as likely to be influenced by testimony introduced in the trial.  In other words, you aren't the blank slate they prefer.  I was picked for a jury to decide if a sex offender was still a threat to society and must be kept under control even though he had served his time.  A question posed to each juror was, "How knowledgeable are you about psychology?"  I replied I had 3 college hours in psychology as a minimum bachelor's degree requirement, but it wasn't my major nor my occupation by a long shot.  I was retained.

I'm 32, registered to vote since the day I turned 18, and I've gotten a notice twice in all those years - and that was twice in two weeks. Since I couldn't financially spare that much time off, and one day of showing up gets you "off" for a year, I called and disputed the second one and they told me never mind. But still, I want to do it, just not quite that often or quite this infrequently, y'know?  And the day I did go in, I didn't even get called for anything at all. It was less than a week after 9-11, and I had to take the El for the first time, got myself all in a flutter and panic (and, to make my day even more delightful, my husband had kindly packed a 9 inch long ceremonial knife in my bag that I didn't know about. Not intentionally - I had brought the bag to church and he packed my athame for me in a pocket I don't usually use, so I didn't think to check for it. Security was not amused.) and then I just sat around all day in one of the largest target high-rise buildings in Chicago reading a book. Mmmmm....nerve-wracking and boring, my favorite combination!  Still, I do want to do my duty, I think it'd be interesting, I'm a stay at home mom with plenty of contacts for babysitting, so even a multi-day trial wouldn't suck (although a sequestered months long thing would, of course) and I have some but not too much higher education (A.A.). I'd be gold, right? But my numbers won't hit in their lottery.     Reply With Quote            WhyNot   View Public Profile  Visit WhyNot's homepage!

Is there anything you can do to make your name more likely to come up?     Are you looking to be on a JURY or just have to serve "Jury Duty"?  Jury duty (for me) is showing up the courthouse with hundreds of other citizens. Then, we get broken into smaller groups of 100 or so, and get sent to a courtroom. There, shit happens, and sometimes you start the voir dire (jury selection) process. Sometimes you don't.  There is probably some city office you can call to make sure you're on the jury duty list. I know people who haven't been called for the 15 years they've lived in Baltimore. Clearly, whatever database jury duty is pulling from doesn't have them in there.  To be selected for a jury, who knows. Probably dependent on the lawyers quick assessment of you (they might know whether you're married, your education level, your job, whether you've been convicted of a crime, and a couple other things.)  I've had jury duty several times. Most times during the voir dire process (the jury selection process), they've filled before they get to me. I've been rejected by defendant's lawyers a couple times. I'm white (seems to be a biggie for some lawyers), and my occupation and education are listed as "engineer" and "masters degree", respectively.

I wanted to serve on the jury the one time I was called but the defendant, choosing to represent himself, did not help select the jury at all (whether or not he had a right to do that as his own council I don't know.)  He was an attractive man in his early 20's, so when the prosecutor was picking a jury she chose a panel made up entirely of middle aged men.  At the time I was a 22 year old woman so I was stuck in the back and actively ignored when she was asking questions of the potential jurors.  He kind of shot himself in the foot by not helping to select the jury if he had the option since the attorney made sure to pick the jury she felt would cut him the least amount of slack.

I work as a paralegal and have participated in trials from the perspective of being at the defense table, but wanted to see what it was like from the jury's side. Both sides seemed comfortable with that, and the judge was bemused.  Unfortunately, the case involved some potential police misconduct, and one of the questions posed to all of us was whether anyone had had any negative experience with law enforcement. I was honest and said "yes," and off I went.  The defense attorney in the case came up to me later and mentioned how disappointed he was that I'd said anything because he really wanted me on that jury. Which probably proves that the prosecutor made the right call booting me off.

I live in a very rural county south of Cleveland.  During the selection process, one of the jurors was asked about his occupation. He'd been a policeman in Cleveland. Had he ever worked in narcotics? Yes, for years. I figured he'd be out of there so fast he wouldn't even get to warm the seat. (As I found out later, he thought the same thing.) But there he sat on the jury after all the dust settled, and he ended up being our foreman. I was glad he was there; he was a font of knowledge about procedure, as well as drugs.  More interestingly (in a Jerry Springer sort of way) was the woman who was originally seated next to me. When they asked if anyone knew of a reason they couldn't serve on the jury, she raised her hand and said, "Yeah, like, the guy who was there in the house and is in the mental hospital now? That's my brother."

It's "common knowledge" that more educated people are more likely to be kicked off by one of the lawyers.  Does anyone know if this is actually true?     When I was a civil litigator, we were generally hoping and praying for intelligent, educated jurors.  We kicked off people who were too uneducated to understand the case or the process.  (For example, I remember using a strike to throw off a woman who had served on both civil and criminal juries in the past, but did not know the difference between a civil and a criminal case.  Yikes!)  What we generally didn't want were: -lawyers -experts in the field the case was about  That was because lawyers and experts tend to have their own ideas about things, regardless of what evidence is presented, and are wild cards in the jury room.  They also tend to lead the juries.  But, a general college education was considered a wonderful thing.  I think the supposed theory behind wanting uneducated jurors is that they will be easily led by lawyers and expert witnesses.  That theory is woefully out of date.  Any reverence that uneducated people had for lawyers and expert witnesses is long gone.  In fact, in my limited experience, uneducated jurors also tend to be wild cards, because they don't want to listen to wealthy lawyers and wealthy experts.  They also tend to have opinions that are 1) uninformed and 2) not swayed by anything that happens at trial.  Post-trial polls revealed strong biases against anyone who appeared to be wealthy and/or educated, whether those people were lawyers, plaintiffs, defendants, or expert witnesses.  Uneducated people actually seemed to hate expert witnesses who had impressive credentials as being "too full of themselves" and would listen more to lesser-qualified local expert witnesses than they would to a person at the top of their field with lots of education and experience.  I would take a college-educated person on a civil jury any day.  People with less education can be good jurors, but in general, are problematic.     Reply With Quote            Q.N.

What, really? No, I don't mean to suggest I disbelieve you, as I actually find it quite cute in a way.  It's much like the tales of people who want to marry without a fuss, so they just grab a couple of witnesses from whatever passers-by happen to be around.  After all, it still *mostly* fits in with the normal idea of random selection of the adult population, and I expect any person called like that would be subject to the same "many are called but few are chosen" thing as those done by the blindly sticking of pins into the electoral register method, but it just *is* sort of cute and funny.   One imagines all sorts of bad happenings in the whatever locality - weather problems leading to complete breakdown of transport thus non-appearance of the predicted pool of potential jurors, unexpected nuclear strike  leading to shortage of people and so on.   Large percentage of potential juror pool eaten by dragons, that sort of thing.  But the only times I was called, well, the normal way, is "this here letter says you MUST, you simply MUST, turn up (or 'phone giving your reference number to find whether you must, or need not) at the High Court on Monday the nth, otherwise we shall be MOST displeased, and you would not like us when we are displeased, oh no!  Otherwise, find a good excuse, like advanced old age or a medical reason, which must be certified by your doctor and sent it to us in official-type writing damn fast."  But, come to think of it, just grabbing potential jurors from the street at least does away with the inability thing, doesn't it?  I mean, anyone happily going about their business when grabbed by the keen young court-attendant person is, by definition, not in hospital dying of the Black Death, so that's one objection done away with.  Of course, were I the evil criminal due to be tried, and were I to know of this idiosyncratic system, I might just want to persuade some friends to "happen" to be passing by the court at the appropriate time   (Hmmmm  .... there is potential.   Do we have any Dopers who could write a short comedy based on this whole lovely idea of juror selection the easy way? )  So then, for the O.P. Mr. Shine , perhaps take a day off work and loiter around the court.   Take some sandwiches and water/fruit juice, sit around ever so nonchalantly and, you know, just lurk around and see if anyone solicits your services.  Of course, it just might be the local police enquiring as to precisely why you are so determinedly loitering around .....

He said that they somehow select people who they know will turn up.  It seems to work - I've been called twice in the three years after the first I was on.  In California the calls come from the drivers license rolls and the voting rolls - so if your name is spelled differently on these, you'll have two shots. But it mostly seems random. I lived for 15 years in NJ, voting every year, and never got called once. I got called a few years after moving to California, then once the next four, and then a lot in the last three.  I've never seen any bias on education. People in Silicon Valley used to say engineers would never be selected, for being too logical, but that hasn't been the case.

Posts: 9,449               There's a lot of randomness involved in being called. I've been registered to vote for 31 years and I've been a property owner for 23 years. I've been called once in all that time (about 15 years ago), and made it as far as voire dire. They picked juror #14 just before they got to me, so I went home and haven't been called since.  My father was called four times in one year--and served two of them.    __________________  --- Yes, I have joined the ranks of former moderators. Being a mod was eating my life.

I've always been interested in that stuff, even the boring parts. But I'm 36 and have been registered to vote since I was 18, and I've only gotten one jury duty notice -- and when I called the court that morning, I was told that I wasn't needed. So I didn't even get a day off from work.

Mostly I sat around the jury pool room and never got taken into a courtroom for empanelment.  With two exceptions:  For a civil trial, the judge introduced the lawyers, the parties, and names of some prospective witnesses and asked if we knew them.  The plaintiff's name was unusual and it hit me -- I knew how to spell it.  The judge gave a brief description of what the case was about and it hit me -- several months before, I'd proofread some pretrial discovery depositions in the case for the court reporters who'd taken them.  Oddly enough, when the attorneys learned that fact, neither side wanted me on that jury.   The other case was criminal.  We the jury pool were given the usual instructive spiel, waited about, got taken into a courtroom, waited about while the attorneys whispered with the judge at sidebar, got taken back to the jury pool room, waited about, and were finally treated to the judge entering to personally thank us and inform us that the defendant, after taking a good look at the panel of his peers ready to sit in judgment on his case, had chosen to plead guilty.

Once in NC in 1982, and once here (VA), a couple months ago.  Dunno why it's taken so long for them to call me - we've lived here since 1989, have a house (property tax), pay income taxes, have drivers' licenses etc. You'd think the pool of qualified jurors would be such that we'd get called a bit more often but I guess not.  In 82 I did my day sitting around waiting then was sent home. This time around, I was torn between wanting to serve, and realizing that medically I really could not (sleep disorder, highly unlikely I could have stayed awake).  I wound up not being needed either of my two days.  Typo was called - and actually served for one short trial - in 1995 but until yesterday, never heard from them again. He just got his questionnaire so it's likely he'll get his call some time this winter. Oh - and he's got a PhD and was not booted during that earlier trial.

That would be my answer: live and register to vote in a county where a low percentage of the populations does so but with a lot of court cases.  I never get called.

If a lawyer intends to present a complicated case, he wants jurors smart enough to understand what he's telling them. On the other hand, the opposing counsel will probably prefer jurors too dumb to understand the arguments.  Crude example: if a prosecutor's case relies heavily on scientific expert testimony and DNA evidence, he'll want jurors bright enough to know what DNA is and smart enough to understand probability. The defense team will want jurors who DON'T understand such things ("DNA, schmee-N-A, that's just a bunch of scientific mumbo jumbo!").

Most are pretty mundane affairs.  I've been called for jury duty 3 times, and only served once. The two times I was rejected, it was due to sheer dumb luck: I drew a high number, and they picked almost all of the people who sat in the front two rows!  In each case, the lawyers asked only perfunctory questions, and rejected only one or two people who seemed like utter idiots.  So, in a high profile case with big bucks and/or long jail sentences at stake, lawyers may get extremely selective. But in a more petty case, they'll probably just take the first 12 people in the jury pool, so long as they don't say anything really goofy our outrageous during voir dire.

We rarely average as many as 20 murders a year statewide nor ever have scandals like enron, so how many crimes that involve juries can we possibily have?  Oooo, maybe those folks from Plainsfield who hid out from the government for a few years will go to trial for tax evasion.

It's "common knowledge" that more educated people are more likely to be kicked off by one of the lawyers.  Does anyone know if this is actually true?     I worked for a criminal defense lawyer that did federal and state cases, and education has never been, to my knowledge, much of a factor in selecting juries. Astorian's explanation sounds pretty reasonable. But, from the cases I've seen tried, ranging from simple to complicated, there seemed to be a wide range of education in the jurors. All of the cases I've seen have had jurors with college degrees, both bachelor's and even master's and Ph.Ds.  My guess is that it's rather unlikely that you would get kicked out for that reason alone, but I'm sure some lawyers may take that into more consideration than the ones I worked for. (I know one lawyer would even ask silly questions like "do you prefer red or blue" as some sort of voodoo insight on one's personality. Whatever.)  Anyhow, the only voir dire I've participated, I got booted off the jury (I would guess because I worked for criminal defense lawyers, or perhaps [more likely] because I had a friend who was a victim of the same crime as that that was being prosecuted. From what I remember, education was not even a question asked in voir dire.)      Last edited by pulykamell; 10-06-2007 at 01:54 AM .

My personal experience is the first time I was called for jury duty was to the Federal court in San Diego, and I was seated as an alternate for a marijuana smuggling & sales case. Though I remained an alternate for the entire trial and thus did not participate in deliberations, I found the parts I was involved in fascinating.  Since then every time I have been called has been to the state court. And without exception each time that I have been included in voir dire I have been dismissed by one of the sides, more often than not with their first peremptory challenge.

Who is eligible for jury service?    Image copyright  PA   Groups of 15 ordinary women and men are selected at random to uphold justice in their local community. It is a civic duty they are obliged to perform. Potential jurors must be at least 18 years old and they should be listed on the electoral roll. They must also have lived in the UK for more than five years since they were 13 years old. However people in some jobs - for example solicitors and police constables - cannot be cited to appear on a jury.     Others who have committed crimes and served time in prison are likely to be disqualified. MPs, MSPs, religious ministers, full-time serving members of the armed forces and people who are over 70 can legitimately apply to be excused. There is a full list of exemptions here . What is the chance of being called for jury service?    Image copyright  Thinkstock   BBC Radio 4's More or Less asked Deirdre Toher, a statistics lecturer at the University of the West of England, to calculate the probability of an eligible person being asked to serve on a jury. She used figures obtained from the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service. She told the programme: "The chance of being called for jury service, as in receiving a citation for jury service, in Scotland is approximately 95% across the 53 years of typical eligibility." Although many people will receive a letter asking them to serve on a jury, far fewer will actually be selected to sit on the jurors' benches. About 30 men and women will be invited to court and 15 will be selected to be part of a jury. In fact, the chance of actually serving on a Scottish jury is about 30%, according to Ms Toher. The probability of being asked to be part of a jury more than once is about 40%, she added. How does that compare to England and Wales?    Image copyright  Thinkstock   South of the border, juries are made up of 12 people, and the odds of being selected for the job are far lower than in Scotland. According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice, there is about a 35% chance of people in England and Wales being summoned for jury service over the course of their lifetime. Only about half of those cited spend any time in court. Listen to the analysis on BBC Radio 4's More or Less on the BBC Radio iPlayer here.

I was on a panel for a trial that made the newspapers (they picked the jury before my turn came) and on another jury which was an interesting decision. Other than they need to pay more it's relatively painless with the one day, one jury system. There is a good chance you will never need to even show up. In any case, my experience was the ones who most wanted to get out were invariably picked for the juries.           Report as inappropriate      12/29/2008                     Elizabeth G.

Sunnyvale, CA           62 friends        0 reviews         It makes me sad, when I read about people who want to duck out of Jury Duty. Please reread what Lauren wrote. I feel that I was lucky to get the Jury I got, when I was falsely accused of a crime. I was accused by a police officer, I had gone to High School with. He claimed not to know me, but he was in my P.E. class in high school. He was a bully than and still is. I was found innocent on one charge, and they dead locked on the second. The DA did not believe the cop in the end. No further charges were ever made. It all started with a minor traffic stop. I felt lucky, that the people listened to my case. - I hope this never happens to you. I could have gone to jail for several years. It is not always bad people that end up in court. - Some are falsely accused. The last time I was called to Jury duty, my dad had just died. They gave me a deferral, and I have not been called since. The time before, I was called, the group of us was in the room waiting to go into the court room, and when the Bailiff told the Judge the Jury was ready, the guy changed his plea to guilty. ( I think he thought the judge would give him a better sentence) We were than excused for that year. The time before that, we the jury I was in, found the guy guilty. It was not even close. We came to the decision in just a few hours. 2 hours ago Lauren C. says: I don't love it either, but it's a privilege as an American citizen to sit on a jury to judge one of your peers.

I feel lucky that I was chosen to be on THAT jury for THAT little girl. I wanted to be picked, since I always wanted to see what jury duty was like. Since it was a molestation trial, the people who got off the jury were a teacher who had a breakdown when questioned, saying she had to report stuff like that all the time. A minister type guy who said he wasn't sure if he could be unbiased and another guy who just wouldn't shut up (seriously!). I think he annoyed the laywers.

Honesty  and factual response to the questionaire and the interview is how I didn't get picked the last time.  The time before I did because I was at the end of the line and the attornies had run out of challenges.  It also depends on the judge.  The last one seemed to be well aware of every trick and mentioned many of the ones posted above.  Sometimes we're not as clever as we think we are.

Dublin, CA           452 friends        391 reviews         Jury Duty is an inconvenience, true.  But I'm gonna have to agree with the "just do it" folks on here.  It is an honor and a privilege that Americans are allowed to participate in the process of government.  Not all Americans agree, and many things are not to your taste.  You may not always achieve the result you want but at least you have a voice. There are many countries where you can't participate, or you can, but it's a facade covering corruption on a massive Federal scale. The US is for the most part different from this and is comparatively open.  It does mean that we make sacrifices in our individual lives for the sake of the community, city, state, or country.  But considering the alternatives, such sacrifices like Jury Duty or taking the time to vote, are small in comparison.

It's simply the luck of the draw.  Ron Chapple/The Image Bank/Getty Images      Whether you consider it "good" luck or "bad," some people do get called for jury duty more than others. There is no government conspiracy behind the fact that you may have received four jury summons in the past decade while your neighbor hasn't gotten one; it's simply the luck of the draw. It's like those people who win the lottery multiple times, except instead of getting millions of dollars, you get to sit in a stuffy courthouse waiting room with slow WiFi.  The simple reason why some people get summoned to report for jury duty more than others is that the selection system is completely random. Prospective jurors are randomly picked by a computer from the jury pool. The pool, in most states, is a combined list of names from both the voter registration rolls and the driver's license database.            If your name is in the jury pool, there is no limit to the number of times that you can be flagged for jury duty. The good news is that once you report for service, your name is pulled from the jury pool for at least the next 12 months, even if you don't get placed on a jury [source: Philadelphia Courts ]. If you actually serve, you are exempt from jury duty for the next two or three years, depending on the state. After that, you're tossed back in the mix.  Instead of seeing it as a curse, you could be thankful that you even qualify to be called for jury duty. Convicted felons aren't allowed to sit on juries, for example, nor are people with serious physical or mental illnesses [source: U.S. Courts ]. In that way, it's a blessing that you are able to serve your country and its impartial judicial system. We salute you, juror number 178293!  Still not convinced that the system is fair?
