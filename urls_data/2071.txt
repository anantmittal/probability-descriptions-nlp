Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

I used to have some as a kid, but I don't have it anymore (I'm redhead). Red hair - Biochemistry and genetics : The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair and non-tanning skin is also associated with freckles , though it is not uncommon to see a redhead without freckles. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant, and the prevalence of these alleles is highest in Scotland and Ireland . The alleles that code for red hair occur close to the alleles that affect skin color, so it seems that the phenotypic expression for lighter skin and red hair are interrelated. Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child. Valverde P, Healy E, Jackson I, Rees JL, Thody AJ (1995). "Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans" . Nature Genetics  11 (3): 328–30. doi : 10.1038/ng1195-328 . PMID  7581459 Abstract: Melanin pigmentation protects the skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). There are two types of melanin, the red phaeome-lanin and the black eumelanin, both of which are present in human skin. Eumelanin is photoprotective whereas phaeomelanin, because of its potential to generate free radicals in response to UVR2, may contribute to UV-induced skin damage. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of phaeomelain in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from UVR1. In mammals the relative proportions of phaeomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), which acts via its receptor (MC1R), on melanocytes, to increase the synthesis of eumelanin3,4 and the product of the agouti locus which antagonises this action5. In mice, mutations at either the MC1R gene or agouti affect the pattern of melanogene-sis resulting in changes in coat colour. We now report the presence of MC1R gene sequence variants in humans. These were found in over 80% of individuals with red hair and/or fair skin that tans poorly but in fewer than 20% of individuals with brown or black hair and in less than 4% of those who showed a good tanning response. Our findings suggest that in humans, as in other mammals, the MC1R is a control point in the regulation of pigmentation phenotype and, more importantly, that variations in this protein are associated with a poor tanning response. 3.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Both red hair and pale skin are caused by recessive MC1R sequence variants, and are closely related. Because of the mutation in MC1R, red heads have low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body, which leads to both pale skin and red hair (since the red pigment pheomelanin overpowers the low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin). 6.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

"Redhead" redirects here. For other uses, see Redhead (disambiguation) .     Woman with red hair       Man with red hair    Red hair (or ginger hair ) occurs naturally in 1–2% of the human population . It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears most commonly in people with two copies of a recessive allele on chromosome 16 which produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. [1]  Red hair varies in hues from a deep burgundy or bright copper (reddish-brown or auburn ) through to burnt orange or red-orange and strawberry blond . It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin . It is associated with fair skin color , lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel), freckles , and sensitivity to ultraviolet light . [2]  Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered.  The term redhead has been in use since at least 1510.

Redheads today are commonly associated with the Celtic nations [4] and to a far lesser extent the Germanic peoples.  In Ireland , the percentage of population with red hair is estimated to be at around 10%, [5] making it the most red-haired country in the world. According to Britain's DNA, 34.7% of the Irish population carry the allele for red hair, although this doesn't directly translate proportionally into births of red-haired children. [6]  Scotland also has a very high percentage with around 6% of the population having red hair. [7] [8] Dr. Jim Wilson of Britain's DNA study used a sample of 2,343 people, and found red hair occurrence of 6% in Scotland, with 35% overall carrying the allele and Edinburgh having the highest proportion at 40%. [7] [8] [9] The largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland, which analysed over 500,000 people, found the percentage of Scots with red hair to be 5.3%. [10]  England has a red hair prevalence of around 4%, with 28.5% of population having the allele; [7] while in Wales 38% of Welsh people carry the red-haired allele. [7] A 1956 study of hair colour among British Army recruits from Great Britain found higher levels of red hair in Wales and the Scottish border counties of England . [fn 1] [11]  Eastern and Southern Europe     A Roman fresco depicting Bacchus with red hair, Boscoreale , c. 30 BC    Carleton Coon's 1939 book The Races of Europe stated that rufosity (reddish hair) often occurred in Montenegrins . [12] [13] [14]  In Italy , red hair is found at a frequency of 0.57% of the total population, without variation in frequency across the different regions of the country. [15] In Sardinia, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.24% of the population. [15]  Victorian era  ethnographers considered the Udmurt people of the Volga to be "the most red-headed men in the world", [16] a claim which has a solid basis even today, as the Volga region has more redheads per population than anywhere else in the world with the exception of Ireland . [17]  North Africa and Mediterranean      Hades abducting Persephone , fresco in the small royal tomb at Vergina , Macedonia, Greece , c. 340 BC    The Berber populations of Morocco [18] and northern Algeria have occasional redheads. Red hair frequency is especially significant among the Riffians from Morocco and Kabyles from Algeria, [19] [20] [21] respectively. The Queen of Morocco , Lalla Salma wife of king Mohammed VI , has red hair. Abd ar-Rahman I also had red hair, his mother being a Christian Berber slave.  Red hair is also found amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish populations. [22] In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair. [23] Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards . [24] In European culture, prior to the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition , all those with red hair were identified as Jewish. [25] In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair. [27] The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia. [28]  Asia (all regions)     A Uyghur girl in Kashgar , China 's Xinjiang region, with auburn hair    In Asia, genetic red hair is rare, but reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair can be found in the Levant ( Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine ), in Turkey , in Caucasia , in Northern Kazakhstan , among Uyghurs and among Indo-Iranians . [ editorializing ] The use of henna on hair and skin for various reasons occasionally occurs in Asia. When henna is used on hair it dyes the hair to different shades of red. [29] [30]  Americas, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa  Emigration from Europe has multiplied the population of red haired humans in the Americas , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . In the United States , it is estimated that 2–6% of the population has red hair. This would give the U.S. the largest population of redheads in the world, at 6 to 18 million, compared to approximately 420,000 in Ireland and 300,000 in Scotland. [7]  Historical     Woman with mixed reddish-brown hair, Papua New Guinea . Melanesians have a significant incidence of mixed-fair hair, caused by a genetic mutation different from European blond and red hair. [31]    Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red-haired. [32] The ancient peoples Budini and Sarmatians are also reported by Greek author to be blue-eyed and red-haired, and the latter even owe their names to it. [33] [34]  In Asia, red hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians , who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China . Caucasian  Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC . [35]  Reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair is also found amongst some Polynesians , and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture reddish hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high-ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership. [36] [37]  Biochemistry and genetics     A close-up view of red hair        Roman fresco of a woman with red hair wearing a garland of olives, from Herculaneum , made sometime before the city's destruction in 79 AD by Mount Vesuvius (which also destroyed Pompeii).    The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.  The genetics of red hair, discovered in 1997, appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome  16 . Red hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer.  The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is unable to tan . Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, freckles are a common but not all-inclusive feature of red-haired people. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant [2] .  Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child.  Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not always sufficient, for red hair production. [38]  Genetics  The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His , and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. [39] The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA ) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. [40] [41]  In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms.  Evolution  Origins  Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin. [42] In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm untanned skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads can become more common through genetic drift . [39]  Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago. [43] [44]  A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans. [45]  Extinction hoax  See also: Disappearing blonde gene  A 2007 report in The Courier-Mail , which cited the National Geographic magazine and unnamed "geneticists", said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future. [46] Other blogs and news sources ran similar stories that attributed the research to the magazine or the "Oxford Hair Foundation". However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter & Gamble , and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The National Geographic article in fact states "while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn't going away". [47]  Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive allele (variant of a gene), the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future. [47]  Medical implications of the red hair gene  Melanoma  Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through suntanning , but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage . Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability. [48] It has been found that Europeans who are heterozygous for red hair exhibit increased sensitivity to UV radiation. [49]  Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person's health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma . [50] [51]  Pain tolerance and injury  Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain compared to people with other hair colors. One study found that people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels), [52] while another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain. [53] [54] [55]  Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic . [56] Other research publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men. [57] A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide . [55]  The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation-driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain-relieving endorphins . (Both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC , and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH. [58] Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin , but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. [58] Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some crosstalk between the POMC hormones; this may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.  There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications. [59] [60] One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising . [60]  Red hair of pathological origin  Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder:   In cases of severe malnutrition , normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde . The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor , is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine .  One variety of albinism (Type 3, a.k.a. rufous albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea , results in red hair and red-colored skin. [61]  Red hair is found on people lacking pro-opiomelanocortin . [61] [62]   Culture     Most likely a posthumous painted portrait of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt with red hair and her distinct facial features, wearing a royal diadem and pearl-studded hairpins, from Roman Herculaneum , late 1st-century BC to mid-1st century AD [63]       Polychrome Roman marble statue depicting the goddess Tyche holding the infant Plutus in her arms, 2nd century AD, Istanbul Archaeological Museum    In various times and cultures, red hair has been prized, feared, and ridiculed.      Portrait of a Lady , ca. 1470–1475, by Sandro Botticelli        Elizabeth I of England , ca. 1588    Beliefs about temperament  A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In Anne of Green Gables , a character says of Anne Shirley , the redheaded heroine, that "her temper matches her hair", while in The Catcher in the Rye , Holden Caulfield remarks that "People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie [his dead brother] never did, and he had very red hair."  During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a sanguine temperament . [64] In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda , redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament.  Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of Gulliver's Travels , "A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms ," when he writes that: "It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity." Swift goes on to write that "neither was the hair of this brute [a Yahoo ] of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe". [65] Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero . They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of "criminal women" were redheads. [66]  Media, fashion and art     "The Accolade" by Edmund Blair Leighton    Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman , Alyson Hannigan , Marcia Cross , Christina Hendricks , Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye. [ citation needed ]  Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India , Iran , Bangladesh and Pakistan , henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance. [67]  Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color " Titian " takes its name from the artist Titian , who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli 's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites , Edmund Leighton , Modigliani , [68] and Gustav Klimt . [69]  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes story " The Red-Headed League " (1891) involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film DuBarry Was a Lady featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor .  Notable fictional characters with red hair includes Red Sonja , Mystique , and Poison Ivy . [70]  Prejudice and discrimination against redheads  Medieval beliefs      Barbarossa (Redbeard), Ottoman Admiral    Red hair was thought to be a mark of a beastly sexual desire and moral degeneration. A savage red-haired man is portrayed in the fable by Grimm brothers ( Der Eisenhans ) as the spirit of the forest of iron. Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper , in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk . [71]  Montague Summers, in his translation of the Malleus Maleficarum , [72] notes that red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch , a werewolf or a vampire during the Middle Ages;   Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires. It is significant that in ancient Egypt, as Manetho tells us, human sacrifices were offered at the grave of Osiris, and the victims were red-haired men who were burned, their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowing-fans. It is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest, red-hair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn. But these men were called Typhonians, and were representatives not of Osiris but of his evil rival Typhon, whose hair was red.   Medieval antisemitism      Fagin in a watercolour by 'Kyd'    During the Spanish Inquisition , people of red hair were identified as Jewish and isolated for persecution. [25] In Medieval Italy and Spain, red hair was associated with the heretical nature of Jews and their rejection of Jesus , and thus Judas Iscariot was commonly depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair, with red-hair being given by the authors to villainous Jewish characters such as Shylock and Fagin . [27] The antisemitic association persisted into modern times in Soviet Russia. [28] The medieval prejudice against red-hair may have derived from the Ancient biblical tradition, in relation to biblical figures such as Esau and King David . The Ancient historian Josephus would mistranslate the Hebrew Torah to describe the more positive figure of King David as 'golden haired', in contrast to the negative figure of Esau , even though the original Hebrew Torah implies that both King David and Esau had 'fiery red hair'. [73]  Modern-day discrimination  "Carrot head" redirects here. For the French novel, see Poil de carotte .  In his 1885 book I Say No , Wilkie Collins wrote "The prejudice against habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair."  In his 1895 memoir and history The Gurneys of Earlham , Augustus John Cuthbert Hare described an incident of harassment: "The second son, John, was born in 1750. As a boy he had bright red hair, and it is amusingly recorded that one day in the streets of Norwich a number of boys followed him, pointing to his red locks and saying, "Look at that boy; he's got a bonfire on the top of his head," and that John Gurney was so disgusted that he went to a barber's, had his head shaved, and went home in a wig. He grew up, however, a remarkably attractive-looking young man." [74]  In British English , the word "ginger" is sometimes used to describe red-headed people (at times in an insulting manner), [75] with terms such as "gingerphobia" [76] and "gingerism" [77] used by the British media. In Britain, redheads are also sometimes referred to disparagingly as "carrot tops" and "carrot heads". (The comedian " Carrot Top " uses this stage name .) "Gingerism" has been compared to racism , although this is widely disputed, and bodies such as the UK Commission for Racial Equality do not monitor cases of discrimination and hate crimes against redheads. [77]  Nonetheless, individuals and families in Britain are targeted for harassment and violence because of their hair colour. In 2003, a 20-year-old was stabbed in the back for "being ginger". [78] In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; [79] in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne , was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crime on account of their red hair. [80] In May 2009, a schoolboy committed suicide after being bullied for having red hair. [81] In 2013, a fourteen-year-old boy in Lincoln had his right arm broken and his head stamped on by three men who attacked him "just because he had red hair". The three men were subsequently jailed for a combined total of ten years and one month for the attack. [82]  This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. The British comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series The Catherine Tate Show . The sketch saw fictional character Sandra Kemp , who was forced to seek solace in a refuge for ginger people because she had been ostracised from society. [83] The British comedy Bo' Selecta! (starring redhead Leigh Francis ) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people. (Hucknall, who says that he has repeatedly faced prejudice or been described as ugly on account of his hair colour, argues that Gingerism should be described as a form of racism. [84] [85] ) Comedian Tim Minchin , himself a redhead, also covered the topic in his song "Prejudice". [86]  The pejorative use of the word "ginger" and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the " Ginger Kids ", " Le Petit Tourette ", " It's a Jersey Thing " and " Fatbeard " episodes of South Park .  Film and television programmes often portray school bullies as having red hair. [87] However, children with red hair are often themselves targeted by bullies; "Somebody with ginger hair will stand out from the crowd," says anti-bullying expert Louise Burfitt-Dons . [88]  In Australian slang , redheads are often nicknamed "Blue" or "Bluey". [89] More recently, they have been referred to as "rangas" (a word derived from the red-haired ape, the orangutan), sometimes with derogatory connotations. [90] The word "rufus" has been used in both Australian and British slang to refer to red-headed people; [91] based on a variant of rufous , a reddish-brown color.  In November 2008 social networking website Facebook received criticism after a 'Kick a Ginger' group, which aimed to establish a "National Kick a Ginger Day" on 20 November, acquired almost 5,000 members. A 14-year-old boy from Vancouver who ran the Facebook group was subjected to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for possible hate crimes. [92]  In December 2009 British supermarket chain Tesco withdrew a Christmas card which had the image of a child with red hair sitting on the lap of Santa Claus , and the words: " Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones " after customers complained the card was offensive. [93]  In October 2010, Harriet Harman , the former Equality Minister in the British government under Labour, faced accusations of prejudice after she described the red-haired Treasury secretary Danny Alexander as a "ginger rodent". [94] Alexander responded to the insult by stating that he was "proud to be ginger". [95] Harman was subsequently forced to apologise for the comment, after facing criticism for prejudice against a minority group. [96]  In September 2011, Cryos International, one of the world's largest sperm banks , announced that it would no longer accept donations from red-haired men due to low demand from women seeking artificial insemination . [97]  Use of term in Singapore and Malaysia  The term ang mo ( Chinese : 红毛 ; pinyin : hóng máo ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : âng-mo͘ ) in Hokkien ( Min Nan ) Chinese means "red-haired", [98] and is used in Malaysia and Singapore to refer to white people. The epithet is sometimes rendered as ang mo kui ( 红毛鬼 ) meaning "red-haired devil", similar to the Cantonese term gweilo ("foreign devil"). Thus it is viewed as racist and derogatory by some people. [99] Others, however, maintain it is acceptable. [100] Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as The Straits Times , [101] and in television programmes and films.  The Chinese characters for ang mo are the same as those in the historical Japanese term Kōmō ( 紅毛 ), which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for Dutch or Northern European people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during Sakoku , its 200-year period of isolation. [102]  Red hair festivals     Hundreds of redheads together at the Redhead Day , September 2007    There has been an annual Redhead Day festival in the Netherlands that attracts red-haired participants from around the world. The festival is paid for by the local government in Breda, a city in the south east of the Netherlands. [103] It attracts participants from over 80 different countries. The international event began in 2005, when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads. Today, the festival includes music, fashion shows, art exhibitions and a picnic [104]  The Irish Redhead Convention, held in late August in County Cork since 2011, claims to be a global celebration and attracts people from several continents. The celebrations include crowning the ginger King and Queen, competitions for the best red eyebrows and most freckles per square inch, orchestral concerts and carrot throwing competitions. [105]  A smaller red-hair day festival is held since 2013 by the UK's anti bullying alliance in London, with the aim of instilling pride in having red-hair. [106]  Since 2014, a red-hair event is held in Israel, at Kibbutz Gezer (Carrot) , held for the local Israeli red hair community, [107] including both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi red-heads. [108] However, the number of attendees has to be restricted due to the risk of rocket attacks, leading to anger in the red-hair community. [109] The organizers state; "The event is a good thing for many redheads, who had been embarrassed about being redheads before.” [109]  The first and only festival for red heads in the United States was launched in 2015. Held in Highwood, Illinois, Redhead Days draws participants from across the United States. [110]  Religious and mythological traditions  In the Iliad , Achilles ' hair is described as ξανθῆς [111] ( ksanthēs ) , usually translated as blonde, or golden [112] but sometimes as red or tawny. [113] [114] His son Neoptolemus also bears the name Pyrrhus, a possible reference to his own red hair. [115]  The Norse god Thor is usually described as having red hair. [116]     Mary Magdalene is commonly portrayed with long red hair, as in this painting by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys    The Hebrew word usually translated "ruddy" or "reddish-brown" ( admoni  אדמוני , from the root ADM אדם , see also Adam and Edom ) [117] [118] [119] [120] was used to describe both Esau and David .  Early artistic representations of Mary Magdalene usually depict her as having long flowing red hair, although a description of her hair color was never mentioned in the Bible, and it is possible the color is an effect caused by pigment degradation in the ancient paint.  Judas Iscariot is also represented with red hair in Spanish culture [121] [122] and in the works of William Shakespeare , [123] reinforcing the negative stereotype.

I'm a mutant. You're a mutant, too.     Author:   alle   Publish date:  October 3, 2013    Tags:  Tags:  eyelashes , science , red hair , redheads , genetics , freckles , eyes , blue eyes , chins , heterochomia , mutations                    If I wasn’t a writer, I think I’d like to be a genetic researcher. I know, they seem like totally unrelated fields, but hear me out.  The thing that interests me most in the entire world is why people (or characters) are who they are, and what makes them tick. And one of the things at the very bottom of what makes people tick is in their genes, and I think that’s why I find genetics so interesting. I love picking out the features that I inherited from my parents (my dad’s eyes, my mum’s cheekbones) as well as those that haven’t appeared for several generations (my hair texture).  Since humans are around 99.9% genetically identical, it’s amazing to think that such a tiny percentage difference can result in such incredible variation in our species. And one of the vehicles for that variation is genetic mutation.  Unfortunately, we’re not yet mutating the power of flight or telepathy--sorry, Doctor X. A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA structure of a gene. They can be inherited or acquired, and they can be beneficial, neutral or pathogenic (seldom are they superpowers). Some mutations eventually become so common that they’re considered “normal,” and then we call them polymorphs, whereas others remain rare and unusual in the human population.  Because this is a beauty site, I’ve picked seven physical mutations to write about. Some of them are considered polymorphs and some aren’t, but they all make us uniquely beautiful.  And who knows--maybe someday I’ll get that adamantium skeleton I’ve been asking Santa for since I was six.   HETEROCHROMIA  I never thought much about my eyes growing up. They were very much like my dad’s, and I figured that having blue, yellow and green all mixed up together was just what green eyes looked like.       Imagine my surprise to find out that this is actually quite atypical, and all thanks to a mutation called heterochromia iridum . It refers to eyes that have multiple colours in them, and you’ve probably heard of it if you’ve seen X Men: First Class ; young Professor X calls it “a very groovy mutation.”       There are three types of heterochromia:  Complete (each eye a different colour).  Sectoral (a segment of contrasting colour in the iris).  Central (a different colour radiating out from the pupil).        These three categories are pretty fluid, though, and they can combine in weird and wonderful ways. My left eye is far lighter and more yellow than my right, while my right eye has The Blotch. Both have rings of grey and yellow around the pupil.  I guess this is why I always get attitude at the DMV when I tell them my eyes are green.  If you’re born with heterochromia, it’s probably because one of your parents had it--it’s a dominant autosomal trait. Though you could also be a chimera (two fertilised eggs fusing into one zygote, each with a different gene for eye colour) or a mosaic (someone with two or more different genetic codes in their cells; in this case, a slightly altered gene responsible for eye colour).  It’s also possible to acquire heterochromia, although you probably don’t want to. It’s almost always the result of a serious illness or injury . Certain medications have been known to deposit brown pigment in eyes --a pretty rare side-effect, and one that usually only happens in hazel eyes, but certainly one worth mentioning.  Most sources I consulted say that heterochromia is super-rare, but from my very scientific study of xoVainers (both readers and writers), I’ve determined that it really ISN’T rare at all. It seems like most of us have some form of this, with central being the most popular. Multicoloured eyes, unite!   DOUBLE EYELASHES  I had to include this after Hannah’s outstanding Elizabeth Taylor tutorial , because Liz Taylor was famous for her super-dark, gorgeous double eyelashes.  It’s called distichiasis , and if you’re born with it, it’s because one of your parents had it (it’s a dominant trait, so you’re welcome, future offspring). It’s the result of a transcription error on your 16th chromosome, and can also be a symptom of some pretty serious heart-related disorders .  This is another fun mutation expressed in my phenotype. It’s not as obvious on me as it is on some people, because my eyelashes are blonde. But man, do I ever have a lot of them.  There is a difference, though, between having “lots of eyelashes” and a double row, and it can difficult to figure out if you have this particular mutation or not . Google is very little help, except to be absolutely disgusting (seriously, is there anything grosser than gross eye pictures?). So today I’m going to be better than Web MD.  Here’s how you can tell: Lift up the lashes on your upper eyelid and peek underneath where the waterline is. If your eyelashes stop and then your waterline starts, you have beautiful thick lashes. If, however, you can see lashes sprouting out of your waterline where they should not be (I find this incredibly distressing), then congratulations, you have distichiasis.       Anecdotally, this isn’t always the super-gorgeous advantage that it sounds like. I had to have seven eyelashes that were growing in towards my eye removed when I was a kid, which, thankfully, I only have vague memories of now.  Another way to tell is to go to a new eye doctor for a checkup. If they say “Damn, what’s going on HERE?” then congratulations, and may the spirit of Liz Taylor be with you.   RED HAIR  I think most people know that red hair is a recessive trait; meaning that if you’re a ginger (term used with lots of love), you have two variant copies of a gene called MC1R on each of your 16th chromosomes. This mutation results in generally fairer skin, freckles (we’ll get to them), light-coloured eyes, issues dealing with UV light and, recent studies have suggested, a unique pain tolerance .  That’s all pretty neat, but I want to talk about a totally false idea that regains popularity every couple of years: that redheads are going extinct, and that there will be no more gingers as early as 2060.  No. Just no.        How Stuff Works debunked this very, very thoroughly : “Recessive genes can become rare but don't disappear completely unless everyone carrying that gene dies or fails to reproduce. So while red hair may remain rare, enough people carry the gene that, barring global catastrophe, redheads should continue to appear for some time.”  So the next time your Facebook friends all start posting nonsense about the looming Gingerpocalypse, just send them a link to this article and settle their hash. Then reread Anne of Green Gables and feel pleased that all is right with the world.   FRECKLES  I have a few freckles, and I think they are the cutest. I always wished that I had more, probably because a lot of my friends growing up had them.       And guess what causes them? Or rather, guess what partially causes them?  That’s right: MUTATIONS.  And it all has to do with cells in the skin that make pigment called melanocytes. When exposed to UV light, melanocytes produce melanin, which makes skin darker to protect our DNA. There are two main types of melanin--eumelanin and pheomelanin. Pheomelanin is less common, and it’s what gives red hair and freckles their orangey tone.  Remember a second ago when we were talking about red hair and the MC1R gene? That guy is coming back into play again here. When the MC1R gene is working normally, it turns all pheomelanin into eumelanin. This means skin tans instead of freckles, and hair is a colour other than red. But when the MC1R gene isn’t working, you get red hair and freckled skin thanks to all that lovely pheomelanin floating around.  “But Alle,” I hear you saying. “Not all people who have freckles also have red hair.”  You’re so right! Remember how we know that being a ginger is a recessive trait that needs two copies of a gene--one from each parent--to be expressed?   (WARNING: SEASON SIX DOCTOR WHO SPOILER APPROACHING IN THE NEXT GRAPHIC. IF RIVER SONG IS STILL A MYSTERY TO YOU, PLEASE LOOK AWAY NOW.)       MCR1 is that gene! Some people have a single mutated copy of it and have no idea--but it means that not all their pheomelanin changes to eumelanin, and they still get freckles when exposed to UV light. My family hasn’t ever had any redheads in it--we’re generally either dark blondes or have black Irish hair--but I, and a few of my cousins, still have freckles. It could be that we’re carrying a single redhead gene , makin’ pheomelanin like it’s our JOBS.  Or it could be something else entirely, because this only applies SOMETIMES. Not all people with red hair have freckles (though it’s more likely) and, as we know, not all people with freckles also have red hair. Something else is afoot, but scientists don’t know what it is yet. Another gene doing something? Environment? Epigenetics? No idea!  This is a super-weird result, because it tells us that freckles are a dominant trait, being expressed even when there’s only one copy of the gene in question, but red hair itself is recessive-- even though they’re both caused by the same gene . Genetics is really cool and complicated, guys.   BLUE EYES  I know: WHAAAAAAAA? Blue eyes aren’t exactly rare! But mutations don’t have to be rare--this one now appears in so much of the population that it's considered a polymorph. But really, blue eyes are the result of a pretty recent mutation. You know, 10,000 years ago. Practically yesterday.       The first thing you gotta know is that blue eyes aren’t technically a colour-- they’re a lack of colour. Eye colour is determined by pigments in the part of the iris called the stroma, and if there is a tiny amount of pigment there (or none at all), eyes will appear blue. A bit more pigment gives us green eyes. And if there’s heaps of pigment, eyes are brown.  The gene that’s responsible for this is called OCA2, and it controls melanin. Back in the day, all humans had brown eyes--eyes with lots of melanin pigment. One day, a nearby gene mutated and started to limit OCA2’s ability to produce melanin in the iris. This stopped melanin from colouring the eyes, leaving the stroma blue, and voila! Blue eyes appeared in the population.  In fact, scientists currently think that everyone who has blue eyes is descended from a single common individual who lived around the Black Sea six to ten thousand years ago. How’s that for neat?   CLEFT CHIN  Cleft chins are caused when the two halves of the jaw bone (or muscle) don’t quite fuse properly during development. A lot of reeeeeally attractive people have cleft chins, so please excuse me while I indulge in some eye candy.       Common wisdom-- and also Wikipedia --states that this is a primarily dominant genetic trait.  Allow me to bust this myth.  First: not all cleft chins are exactly the same. There’s heaps of variation when it comes to size (round dimples, eg: Kirk Douglas, vs Y-shaped clefts, eg: Aaron Ekhart) and depth (very subtle vs very deep). So it’s sometimes harder than you’d think to say which chin is smooth and which isn’t.  Second: men are more frequently butt-chinned than women are, which doesn’t fit the simple dominant-recessive genetic model. A really old study (from 1939) recorded that 9.6% of German men and 4.5% of German women had cleft chins. That’s a really big difference between sexes for a trait that isn’t supposed to be sex-linked.   Another study (from 1960) found that even when two parents had smooth chins, they could still have cleft-chinned offspring. It didn’t happen often (11% of the time), but it happened. If cleft chins truly are dominant, this should have been impossible.  So basically, if Alexander Skarsgard and I ever had a kid, there’s a chance it would have a cleft chin--but it’s not a certainty.       That’s a little disappointing, honestly.   NO-SHOW WISDOM TEETH  If there's one thing I wish would just DIE RIGHT OUT OF THE HUMAN POPULATION, it would be wisdom teeth. Mine popped up when I was 20, all four completely on their sides, two of them poking through the gums like painful little islands in a sea of pink gum.  There’s a lot of variation when it comes to how people recover after wisdom teeth surgery--I did not have a great time. I honestly hope that not many of you guys know what dry sockets are, because they are the worst and most horrible things.  When I cursed my horrible teeth to my dad, he got really quiet and said “I never had those.”  Yep. My dad is one of the lucky ones who was born without wisdom teeth.       As things are right now, we aren’t totally sure that this is a mutation, because we’re not sure why wisdom teeth don’t show up (even though it happens in an estimated 35% of the population) . Is there a gene that says “NO, WISDOM TEETH, DO NOT GROW HERE”? A bunch of genes? Is it due to environmental factors? Some kind of physical injury in childhood that prevents them from forming? Nobody knows for sure!  There’s some recent evidence that the suppression of wisdom teeth was a mutation that popped up in China three to four hundred THOUSAND years ago . This doesn’t prove anything, but it sure is interesting to think that my dad is possibly the beneficiary of a four-hundred-thousand-year-old mutation.  Although if the point of variation like this is to pass them down to your children, that didn’t work out very well. Both my brother and I had fully impacted wisdom teeth followed by painful surgeries and long recoveries. Wahmp wahmp.  Which of these mutations do you have? What other genetic traits do you have? If you had to pick an X Men-style superpower, which one would it be? I always wanted to be Storm because of her awesome hair and ability to fly, but I’d totally settle for being Professor X if it meant I could hang out with Patrick Stewart.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3.

Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair.

Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct.

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       I have red hair and blue eyes, both of my parents have blue eyes but light brown hair, My husband had dark brown hair and dark brown eyes, his parents both have dark brown hair and his mom has blue eyes and his dad has brown...my question is, if we have a child what are its chances of having blue eyes or red hair?        -A curious adult from Ohio   February 16, 2006  The chances for green or blue eyes are around 50% ( click here for the details). The chances for red hair depend entirely on whether or not your husband carries a hidden red hair gene. If he does, then there is most likely a 50-50 shot for a redhead. If he doesn't, then the chances are close to zero ( click here for more details).  So, if your husband is a carrier for red hair, then your chances for a redhead with blue or green eyes is 1 in 4 (we separate out the two below). If he isn't a carrier, then chances are pretty close to zero for a blue-eyed child with red hair. Let's see where I got those numbers.   Eye color : As I said earlier, your chances for a child with blue or green eyes are around 50%. These chances are based on an eye color model where two genes determine eye color.  The first gene is the brown-blue gene, bey2. It comes in two forms, a brown (B) and a blue one (b). Brown is dominant over blue which means if either or both of your copies of this gene are B, then you have brown eyes (remember, we have two copies of most of our genes -- one from mom and one from dad).  OK, so we know you are for sure bb (both copies are blue); that is the only way to get blue eyes. And we know your husband has at least one B since he has brown eyes.  But what about the other copy of his brown-blue gene? It is often hard to figure out if someone is a blue eye carrier. However, because his mom has blue eyes, we know he got a b from her. In other words, he is Bb -- a brown-eyed carrier of blue eyes.  So what does this mean for your children? It means that you will always pass a blue eye version (b) and that your husband will pass one onto his kids half the time. Your kids have a 50-50 shot of not having brown eyes.  We can't rule out that they'll have green eyes, though. This is because there is a 2nd gene, a green-blue gene (gey) that is involved as well. It comes in two forms, a green (G) and a blue (b) one.  One more thing, the brown version of bey2 is dominant over the green version of gey, which is dominant over the blue versions of both genes. In other words, brown trumps green and blue, and green trumps blue.  We don't know your husband's green gene status because we don't know his dad's green gene status (we know yours because you have blue eyes). Because his mom had blue eyes, we know she is bb for the green-blue gene. Which means your husband has at least one b.  If your husband is Gb, then each child has a 1 in 4 chance for blue eyes, a 1 in 4 chance for green, and a 1 in 2 chance for brown. If he is bb for the green-blue gene, then your kids have a 50-50 shot at blue and a 50-50 shot at brown eyes. Our answer here hopefully makes this all more clear.  Your two possible eye color scenarios:  1) Your husband is a carrier for green eyes (BbGb)    2) Your husband is not a carrier for green eyes (Bbbb)     A word of warning. As complicated as this is, it doesn't explain everything about eye color. There are cases where blue-eyed parents have green or brown-eyed kids even though this is impossible by this model.  These sorts of things happen often enough that it probably isn't due just to new mutations in their eye color genes. There are probably genes we just don't know about that are involved in eye color. Click here to learn about how these might work.   Red hair : Red hair is often a very simple dominant/recessive case. What I mean is that a certain gene called MC1R comes in two forms, a nonred (R) and a red (r) form. R is dominant over r.  As a redhead, you are rr, you will always pass a red hair gene down to your kids. But what about your husband? He could be either an RR or an Rr, it is impossible to know right now.  Well, that isn't strictly true. If he could have one gene, MC1R, sequenced, he would have a pretty good idea about whether or not he is a carrier. Unfortunately, no one is currently offering this service*. Some, but not all carriers of the red hair gene have freckles so this can be a hint. But there are people without freckles who carry a red hair gene too (me, for example).  So, let's say your husband is a carrier. Then we are in a similar position to blue eyes. You will always pass on an r version of the MC1R gene. All of your kids will at least be carriers.  Your husband has a 50-50 shot of passing on the red hair version, r. Those kids that get the r from your husband will be redheads. Those who get the R will be carriers.  If your husband is RR, then most likely none of your kids will end up redheads. They will all be carriers of the red hair gene (from you) but not redheads themselves.  OK, so let's put it all together:  Husband genotype  Chance for Red hair/Blue eyes   Bb Gb Rr  1 in 8 (12.5%)   Bb bb Rr  1 in 4 (25%)   Bb Gb RR  Little or none   Bb bb RR  Little or none  Now again, none of this is as simple as I've stated so far. There are some people with red hair whose MC1R gene has no DNA changes. So there are other genes that can cause red hair as well. And there are some DNA changes in only one copy of MC1R that appear to cause red hair even when the other copy has no changes.  However, from the work done thus far, the idea that you end up with red hair when both copies of your MC1R gene are mutated explains around 2/3 of red hair. Pretty good by genetic standards!

By: Rosemary O. Fernandez Around this time last year, I got the best news of my life: My husband and I were expecting a baby! We kept it to ourselves for a while, but soon told our family and friends. As I inevitably expanded, I was asked the inevitable question: Will the little one have red hair too? This was a perfectly reasonable question as I was born with screaming red hair –the kind of shade that has prompted numerous strangers to tell me I have the map of Ireland written on my face despite the fact that I’m mostly Italian. I inherited these locks from my (Italian) mother, and my husband’s mother and grandfather are also gingers. Needless to say, the odds were in the little guy’s favor. Thirty-eight weeks slugged by, and I’d estimate that I heard the question about three times a week. Coworkers joked about it. Family members hoped for it. Random people at the grocery store thought it would be terrific. Naturally all my husband and I prayed for was a healthy child. Whether he popped out with red, blonde, brown, or green hair, we’d cuddle and dote on him just the same. But I’d be lying if I said I never crossed my fingers and daydreamed about strolling down the street with a fiery-headed toddler in tow. Here are some facts to see if  you will have a redhead baby: 1. In order for a baby to have red hair, both parents have to carry the gene, since it’s a recessive trait. So if you’re a ginger and you marry a ginger, odds are, your kids will be gingers, too. If only one parent has the locks but the other is a carrier, the baby’s chances are 50/50. If neither of you are red but you both are carriers, you have a one in four chance of a fiery-haired child. And, sorry to say, if only one parent is not a carrier (even though the other is), you’ve got no shot. [ Source ] 2. Even though you might not be a redhead yourself, studies estimate that 25 percent of Caucasian Americans carry the ginger gene, so if you fall into this category you might end up with a redheaded baby when you’re least expecting it. [ Source ] READ: 10 Things To Know If You’re a Redhead Baby My reasons weren’t purely aesthetic, because for me, my hair color is a huge part of my personality. I’m confident. I’m intelligent. I’m friendly. I’m funny (though my husband says it’s usually when I don’t mean to be). Growing up, my hair helped me cultivate these qualities. I’m used to strangers addressing me simply because they want to pay me a compliment about my hair; therefore I have no problem doing the same to someone else when I like their outfit or a speech they presented. On the first day of school when teachers called my name, they also told me they liked my hair; hence I became comfortable in a classroom from an early age, absorbed more information, and was never too timid to raise my hand when I knew the answer. I’m often the only redheaded in my group of friends, so I developed a good sense of direction; since I’m the most easily spotted in a crowd, my pals often followed me when we were out.

READ: Facts About Redheads That May Surprise You I want all this and more for my child. More than I want to dress him in t-shirts that have fun redheaded slogans, I want him to be confident. I want him to know he’s smart. I want him to not be afraid to be kind. Though hair color doesn’t determine these qualities, I know from experience that it helps. Sixteen weeks after birth, what’s the verdict? The jury’s still out. The baby was born with dark hair. Those strands have now mostly fallen out, and it looks like some red is replacing it. Only time will tell. But I still have my fingers crossed. Rock it like a Redhead!

Over the centuries though, DNA has evolved, changed and mutated, so some of us bear little similarities to our ancestors in regard to things like physical features and height.  Even though many people go to great lengths to appear like everybody else, we almost all have something that makes us different from the next person. Usually it's a personality trait, some skill we know, or a talent that not many people have.  Some of us, however, have physical characteristics that make us stand out in a crowd: such as our height, complexion, or the shapes of our faces. Most of these are just a part of our genetic makeup, but some are the direct result of genetic mutations.   This blue eyed mutant is obviously angry about being a mutant! | Source   What Is a Genetic Mutation? Put simply, a genetic mutation is when something in our DNA doesn't quite do what it's supposed to. People generally associate the term with birth defects and, indeed, conditions such as albinism, deformities and even some mental conditions.  Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is our genetic blueprint. It tells our cells what do do as we develop. Genetic mutations are the result of a change or a 'misfire' in our DNA. These genetic mutations are often passed down from parent to child, which is why we often resemble our parents and sometimes inherit diseases like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, certain cancers, asthma and, sometimes, a resistance to specific diseases.  Polymorphisms are genetic changes that occur in more than one percent of the population. These are responsible for hair color, eye color and blood type. These DNA changes do not just occur in humans, but are also responsible for different traits and varieties in other species, such as the black Labrador retriever and their yellow or chocolate cousins.  It is generally accepted in the scientific world that modern homo sapiens first originated in Africa about two-hundred thousand years ago. Without genetic mutations, we would likely all bear the same dark skin, brown hair and brown eyes of our ancestors. The term usually has negative connotations, but some of the results of mutations are not harmful. It's important not to think of a genetic mutation as a defect. It's simply a change in our cellular makeup. So do not fill out your application for Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters just yet.       Painting of Mary Magdalene as a red head by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys. | Source   Red Hair The general consensus is that the first red-headed human appeared in Africa about 50,000 years ago. Soon after, people with fiery hair began migrating to Europe. But how did red hair happen in the first place?  Scientists have declared that red hair is a genetic mutation of sorts that occurs in less than three percent of the entire human population. In some areas, such as Great Britain, red hair occurs in as much as six percent of the population. It is the rarest hair color among humans and is often associated with very fair skin, light colored eyes and freckles.  The genetic culprit is the gene melanocortin 1 receptor , or MC1R. MC1R is located in the cell membrane and is affected by the pituitary gland. The pigment pheomelanin is what gives hair its red color. 50,000 years ago, a genetic anomaly occurred that caused MC1R to release more pheomelanin that normal and, viola, a redhead was born.  Red hair is referred to as a recessive gene. For a recessive trait to be inherited, both parents have to be carrying a copy of the trait in their DNA. Because both parents need to have the recessive gene to pass it on to their children, certain traits often skip at least one generation.  Blond hair is also a genetic mutation believed to have first occurred about 11,000 years ago. The color is thought to be so prevalent in certain areas of the globe, especially Europe, because of sexual selection. Since blond hair was rare and prized, people possessing it were more often chosen as mates.       A woman with Heterochromia Iridium. | Source   Blue Eyes All humans originally had brown eyes, which occurred because of the large amount of pigment that gives color to the eyes. Scientists believe that blue eyes first occurred between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago, and that all people with blue eyes share a single, common ancestor.  The gene OCA2 controls melanin, the pigment that gives us our coloring. Because of the mutation of an adjacent gene, HERC2, OCA2 turned itself off, like a switch, and allowed humans' eyes to turn blue or, rather, disallowed the eyes to be colored by pigment.  Blue eyes were previously thought to be a recessive gene, but that theory has been proven incorrect. If one parent has blue eyes and the other has brown, the resulting children will generally, but not always, have brown eyes as they are the more dominant trait. Also, two brown-eyed parents can produce a child with an eye color other than brown, even if there are no ancestors with blue or green eyes.  OCA2 is also responsible for albinism: when it is completely turned off, people are born with no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair.  Green eyes are actually a form of brown eyes caused by the amount of melanin that is found in the iris, while Amber eyes are a result of extra yellow-colored pigment in the iris and Grey eyes are caused by deposits of collagen in the iris. Hazel eyes are caused by the amount of melanin in the iris and are affected by Rayleigh scattering, which allows the color to shift in certain lights.  Though Elizabeth Taylor's beautiful eyes were considered to be violet and were one of her largest claims to fame, they were actually a shade of blue. Violet, purple and red eyes can only occur with albinism.  A fairly rare eye color condition, heterochromia iridium , allows for each eye to become a different color. This does not only occur in humans, but also in animals. Husky dogs, for example, often have two different colored eyes. This condition, usually caused by a genetic mutation, can also be inherited. The other causes of Heterochromia are disease and injury. A variation of this condition, sectoral heterochromia , causes some to have multiple colors in the same eye.       Are you a mutant?  Yep. I got red hair.  Yes! I have blue eyes!  I'm a red-haired, blue-eyed DOUBLE MUTANT!  Puny wannabe mutants, I can move objects with only my mind! See results   So, Are We Mutants or Just Different? Gingers get picked on, often called carrot tops, and sometimes kids offer to connect the dots of their freckles. There are millions of "dumb blond" jokes too, and some people are creeped out by people with multi-colored eyes. People who have these differences often wish they didn't, while those who don't have them often wish they did.  It is true that some of these physical features are caused by genetic mutations, but, in the end, these are just some of the things that make us different. The world would be a very boring place if we all looked exactly alike. After all, variety is the spice of life.

They are my best physical attribute and asset.  My red hair, well, that's from a box.  If red hair, though, is a mutation, why do men like women with red hair.  That's exactly why I color my hair a bright to medium auburn color; my husband appreciates it and I always figured it looks good with my eyes.  I've always secretly wished for red hair, though.  ashley 3 years ago  i am tall (for a girl) 5'9, very pale (sunburns), almost like a greyish-periwinkle-blue eyes, and medium ash-blonde superfine hair that shines silver (uurgh!).i also have every kind of freckle known to man, and only one wisdom tooth (another mutation) my brother is also tall (6'2), fair but tans really well, more of a baby blue in his eyes, and golden blonde hair (normal thickness). he has a few freckles and he has every wisdom tooth BUT the one i have is missing ( ?! ) mother is 5'3, same colouring as me, no idea aout the teeth.  dad is 5'7, olive skinned, dark brown hair, baby blue eyes, had all his wisdom teeth. it might be worth it to note that my mom, grandma, and baba (grams mum), and i all have the same certain freckles in the same spots. my brother and i have two that we share that no one else does. mum and i are also the only flat ones in our family.

Jillian 3 years ago  I find it interesting that you said green eyes come from brown eyes. I was born with very blue eyes, around 11 they turned green like my fathers. I have always assumed it was derived from blue eyes, my brother and father had the same thing happen, but their eyes went from blue to green around the age of 4. My parents where both brunettes. A trait only I enherited. My sister and brother are both red heads. But my sister has brown eyes like our mother.

On average they are blue with a steel grey ring.  yup 4 years ago  I have a great nephew who is almost 1year old, he is half white and half Guatemalan he is as white as any other white person. He has the most awesome (sea color) blue eyes. His mom has brown hair/blue eyes and his dad.

Why would this be  patsythedog12345 4 years ago  hi have blue eyes  MaHayla 4 years ago  I have Auburn hair and bright blue eyes,but I love them even if I can't tan.  Karin 4 years ago  I would like to ask something and hoping that somebody will be able to answer. If not the author then maybe somebody else who knows. My grandmother had brown eyes, not hazel or anything, like real chocolate brown eyes. They looked almost dark reddish in the sun. My grandfather had blue eyes, just regular middle toned blue. My mother got these really like ocean blue eyes. A really deep, a little bit darker than the most blue eyes I've seen but nevertheless super blue. Her brother got light green eyes. My father had an icy shade of blue, and all family that I know of on his side of the family have blue eyes. Now I myself have the weirdest eye color, they are green. BUT I also have sectoral heterochromia in my left eye. About 35-40% of it is brown. Both my eyes are green, but the eye without the heterochromia are more of a blue/green shade. Or maybe it's just an illusion you get because of the brown in the other one, I don't know. They're not hazel/green anyway, just blue/green. Another strange thing is that my eyes where blue (completely blue, even without the heterochromia) until I was about 5-6 years. The change didn't happen quickly, rather very slow. No one seemed to notice really. Not even myself really, it was more in the early teen years I started to notice and my mother told me that that's just the way I look. But when you look at pictures from when I was about 5-6 years they are a clear blue. Lately my sectoral heterochromia has gotten darker too, more noticable, the last couple of years. Why is this? How come I got this strange eye color when both my parents are blue eyed? Shouldn't I genetically be blue eyed? Blue being recessive and all? I'm also blond btw, in later years it has turned into kind of  a strawberry blond. When I was younger it was more of a light wheat-blond color. I'm 25 now. I'm 100% swedish, if that matters. Could somebody please explain how it works? Because this have really been om my mind lately.  JamieMcQ 4 years ago  Really good info and postings in the comments section.... I am truly a mutant. I am Irish, have very dark brown/black (now going grey) hair, pale freckled skin and I have three colours in my eyes amber, blue and green, both eyes share the same colours. I went to an optician (very lovely she was) she asked me if it was ok for her to take photos of my eyes as she had never seen it before.... I was more hoping for a date.  Lauren 4 years ago  Haha. I have both red hair and blue eyes, it runs in my mother's side of the family. So what if we are 'mutants'? I am in Junior high and almost everybody in my class comments how pretty I am and how beautiful my red hair and or blue eyes are. I'm proud to be who I am and what I look like :) Thank you for this, it was very interesting and somewhat reassuring for people like me out there.  Raven 4 years ago  hello! I really like the info you gave me. It's fascinating! My mom has blue eyes(but in one eye it has specks of green) and has blonde hair and my dad has deep brown eyes and dark brown hair(nearly black) I have blue/grey eyes and dark brown hair (more chocolate than black though) I can't really decide on my eye color because sometimes it's blue and sometimes it's a gray(most of the time grey)How did I end up with this color of gray?  rhiannah 4 years ago  I have red hair and sectoral heterochromia!

Shannon 5 years ago  I have red hair and blue eyes.  I prefer to think of us as unique, as opposed to mutant!  angie! 5 years ago  i have a best friend who has red hair and green/blue eyes (she likes to pretend they change depending on the clothes she wears). i've already known about the red hair and blue eyes being mutations, but i had no idea about the origins of the other eye colours! very cool, i'm jealous. (brown eyes, black hair, dark skin, and i still get sunburns!)  emilyarkangel 5 years ago  i have blonde hair and blue eyes, they sometimes turn into a hazel. But my father had blonde hair, then turned black at age 16. mom has brown hair, and so does my grandma. everyone in my family has brown hair and eyes. so i was looked on as an angel in my family. I also love reading these articles, very interesting!  C-C88 5 years ago  So interesting! I am strawberry blonde, I was born with red hair, so my mom thought I'd be a redhead, but by the time I reached 6mths-1yrs old, my hair had turned to white-blonde, with dark eyebrows & eyelashes. Once I hit around 5 or 6, it started to darken, now it is more red in the winter, and more blonde in the summer due to natural highlights. This post provided me with answers to my curiosity as to how I ended up with this hair and eye colour! My dad has blue eyes and almost black hair, and my mom has blondy-brown hair with hazel eyes. My eyes are blue, dark around the edges fading to lighter blue, but around the iris, they are yellow, so they are often mistaken as green as in colour mixing, blue and yellow make green :) I also have a genetic mutation of the eyes, causing me to have 3 rows of eyelashes instead of one, called 'distichiasis'. Elizabeth Taylor also had this condition!  Tiffany Francis 5 years ago  Im fourteen and a red head with blue eyes. I always asked my parents why i have red hair and the didn't.  I never knew it was a recesive gene now I'm proud to be part of only a small portion of people that get the have red hair natturally I'm so lucky. And apparently red hair runs in my family.  Bhavya 5 years ago  Hey Guys... uu all r sooo lucky..... :) Well m not so, I hav black hair n brownish black eyes... :(  But i'll love to marry a girl with blue/green/hazel eyes n brown/red hairs when I grow up.... :)  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Amanda, Well, I'm not a scientist, but I'll try! First of all, most people's eyes do change color. Mine are dark brown but, when I'm happy, they're almost an amber color. Hazel eyes are made up of different colors, so different light settings or even the clothes you wear can make them appear darker, lighter, blue, green or even grey. As for your white hairs, age really means nothing. They're white because, for some reason, they have no pigment. It doesn't mean you're old! I'm 41 and have no grey hair, yet my little brothers both had it in their late twenties. The important thing is that you are unique. And I bet your brown hair and hazel eyes together are very pretty. :)  Amanda 5 years ago  I have Brownish/Hazel eyes :) My great Grandpa had blue eyes. My mother, green when she cries. I've never understood why... My eyes actually change color sometimes. It's odd that they turn green, but it's happened and my friend and I were amazed when we notice it. No idea why but its pretty cool! I would love to have blue eyes. Wouldn't care to be called a freak or whatever, dimples are a mutation, yet people like them. I mean, I myself don't care for them, but some of my friends do. My hair.....is weird. Since I was like 5 I can remember my mom telling me that within my brown hair I had white hairs. Of course back then I didn't care, but now I try to pull out all the white hairs I find (I'm 13) classmates have told me I have white hairs and am old or you know, typical jerks being themselves. :/ It makes me feel weird and unconfortable. I have also been told I have red hairs. Which I am cool with. Can you please do your best to explain the why I have had white hairs since probably birth and why my eyes change color?  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas ssjarkin: You're in good company with Willie Nelson and Frank Sinatra! Thanks for the comment! :)  Shawn Jarvis 5 years ago  from Virginia Very interesting that all of us with blue eyes share a common ancestor. Great hub.  ? 5 years ago  I have curly red hair and blue green eyes but im still beautiful  kat For Scarede Cat 5 years ago  I don't know if you were serious, but I'm still going to answer. First, people get grey hair when they get older. If they're not old, still people can get prematurely grey caused by stress for example. And people have lighter hair on top and darker under because sun lightens the top ones. Secondly, eye color and hair color can change when you get older, don't know why though. Like me, I had dark blue eyes and brownish curly hair when I was little, but now I have a bit lighter blue eyes and truly blonde hair. Maybe it's just that you're not fully developped when you are young, or something like that...  Scarede Cat 5 years ago  I have 2 questions if someone could answer them for my curiosity ?? 1.I have seen some people with kinda grey hairs or dark yellow hairs with green shine . what's the reason for green hairs on humans.  Also have seen humans with multi color hairs on same head (NO DYEING). Dark hairs underneath some light hair on top of head. 2. Do your hair and eye color changes with age. I have seen babies with lighter eyes and hairs but they changed to darker hair and eyes as they grow older.  Scarede Cat 5 years ago  Glad to hear i am the FIRST and ORIGINAL human with black hairs and black eye.  All these blond  are mutant, who came after me as younger humans with masks on their faces lol. I am 200,000 yrs old while these Maskets are just 1/20th of my age. I love Einstein who had black hair s and black Eyes while STUPID Hitler was blond... hahahahaha  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Charlotte, I honestly have no idea! If your eyes are changing color, though, you might want to tell your doctor!  Charlotte 5 years ago  Ok, so I have blue eyes. But a couple of years ago I noticed one of my eyes was or rather is green. And in the the eye that remained blue there was a brown stripe right down the middle of my eye!? Why?  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas RiderJen, My hair is actually getting darker as I get older. In the winter it's almost brown and the red doesn't really come out until I'm in the sun. I kind of want it to go white instead of grey, though! Thank you for the comment! ps. Freaks are awesome! :D  RiderJen 5 years ago  Interesting article, thank you for sharing that redheads aren't the only mutants, haha!  As I age, my red hair has faded to strawberry blonde and many people think I'm actually blonde.  I have green eyes.  And, I do tan.  A redhead who tans -- talk about a freak, haha!

Thanks so much :)  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Annie, That's a question I can't answer. I've heard of people with hazel eyes having green and red flecks, but never green. I bet they're beautiful, though. :) Green eyes themselves are brown with extra yellow pigment, so the red flecks could have something to do with that?  Annie 5 years ago  Hi, I was wondering if red eyes would be considered a mutation as well? I have dark brown hair that shines cherry red in the sun, a medium beige complextion, and my eyes are bright green with a lot of gold and red pigment but the red really seems to stand out and I am always complimented for my eyes (someone once aaid they reminded him of christmas! lol) but I have no idea where they come from. My dad has blonde hair and blue eyes and my mom brown hair and hazel eyes. Are red pigmented eyes a mutation as well? Thanks!  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Thank you, Naseem.

The only ones who are not mutants are the people with the darkest complexions; thank you!  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas J, It sounds like you're working harder to convince yourself than the rest of us. ;)  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas David J Beatty, I would have answered your comment sooner but, for some reason, it came across as spam. Not that I think you're spammy or anything! To answer your question, you will have to look back further than your father and mother. Both of my parents have dark eyes and dark brown hair. I have red hair and brown eyes, my oldest younger brother has brown hair and hazel eyes and my youngest brother has brown hair and brown eyes. I'm very fair skinned and my brothers tan easily. We do look enough alike that, when we're standing side by side, you can tell that we are somehow related. My father's family has tons of redheads, so that's where I'm sure I got it from. The hazel eyes my brother has are also prevalent on my daddy's side of the family. My mother was adopted, so we have no idea what traits her birth family carried. It all comes down to genetics. Or, rather, recessive genes and probability. Somewhere in your family tree are the genes that make you and your brothers and sisters appearances so different.  J 5 years ago  Mutant.... I am no mutant.  David J Beatty. 5 years ago  Hi Georgie, I found this article very interesting. I am a 31 yr old Irish man born 4th eldest to 11 siblings, 12 in total including myself. 6 boys and 6 girls. My father has jet black curly hair and these really piersing bark Hazel like eyes and although he is 100% Irish he has a very dark skin almost meditarain and is only 5'4'' tall . My eldest sister has the same hair and almost as close as you could get with the eye color but very white skin. My mother has brown hair and blue eyes and she's tall at 5'9''. What I have always found strange in my family is that 6 of my brothers and sisters have blond hair and blue eyes and mostly very pale skin but go a nice light golden brown in the sun. The other 5 of us 3 girls 2 boys have brown hair like my mothers and 3 of us with blue eyes and and 2 (each male and female) have green eyes. 6 of us small and 6 tall but all a lot taller then our father.  Half of us seem to have a  very broad and  natural muscle that not one of our cousins uncles etc have. How is it do you think that we all look the same with our owen different features but we all have different mutations. My neices and nephews all have the same blond/brown hair and blue/brown eyes. My question there is how does this work? Look forward to your reply. Thanks.  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Darby, I'm a mutant too. Red hair. Welcome to the club! :)  Darby 5 years ago  Im a double mutant. I have red hair and blue eyes :(  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Hi Kathy! I'm a red haired mutant that got stuck with brown eyes. I always wanted green! I love learning about things like this, and I'm glad you liked  the Hub. Thanks for the comment! :)  KathyH 5 years ago  from Las Vegas, Nevada Very interesting, nice to know I'm a mutant! :) Blue eyes REALLY run in my family, our boys both have 'em and so do both grand daughters. This was really fascinating! Our neighbor in Wisconsin had a husky type of dog with one blue eye and one brown. I always thought that looked so interesting!

That's what I have - it never occurred to me that it was rare until I saw it mentioned in an article.  Just curious how many others there are on the BHB.    From: www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/emmakelly/...    4. Red hair and blue eyes is the rarest combination in the world  The majority of natural redheads have brown eyes, with others likely to have hazel or green shades.  But like red hair, blue eye colour is a recessive trait, meaning that both parents must carry the gene for a child to be blessed with it. This makes those with red hair and blue eyes the rarest minority in the world, with only 1% having both.  So, each one is about as rare as a four-leaf clover.

04/22/2014  Yes, DH is very much a redhead. Or at least was. He's turning blonde now he's getting old. Gingers apparently turn blonde rather than white haired when they age.      Lol! He probably got the hair from Dh then. I'd say chances aren't that slim after all, which isn't a bad thing, bean is absolutely gorgeous. But then again I'm no expert. I'm just going off of what I've researched. Before LO  (little one) was born I was dead set that he'd be a redhead since it runs heavy in my family. So I looked up the odds all I got was what I already said about the recessive gene.

No one in my family has red hair. They are all Italian and dark hair or blonde hair. My husbands dads uncle is the only one that had red hair. Everyone else had brown or blonde. None of the other grandkids have red hair except one. It ran on her moms side of the family though. So I figured that's where she got her red hair. Just didn't know what the chances are. Especially since it doesn't run in my family. My two boys have light brown and dark brown hair. Just curious as to what you think??

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Eye Color  Hair Color  Genetics and Heredity  Eyes  Hair Is it rare to have red hair and blue eyes? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 12 Answers   Alexander Polsky , studied Early Islamic History & Public and International Affairs at Princeton University (1984) Answered Dec 23, 2017 · Author has 926 answers and 224.7k answer views There’s an error in many of the answers here. Respondents observe that “blue eyes are rare and recessive” and “red hair is rare and recessive” — so they therefore infer that the combination must be exceedingly rare. Didja catch the logical error there? The respondents are assuming that these two traits have no correlation either to each other or to anything else; that is that the likelihood that you’ll find someone with traits A and B = (likelihood of A) * (likelihood of B). But that’s not the case at all with red hair and blue eyes. Both traits emerged in the relatively small historical population of Northern Europe, and were spread to a few nearby places. These two traits— nonexistent in most of the world, are thus both quite common in places like Scotland or Ireland, and along the Volga (perhaps brought there by Vikings) and thus the combination of these traits is fairly common there too. Overall, on the planet— both these traits are very rare. You can meet a billion Chinese or Indians and not see one person with red hair or blue eyes, let alone both. But if you’re in Edinburgh, Dublin or Cardiff, not to mention Kensington Palace, you’ll have no trouble finding folks with this combination. It’s a bit like asking “are tall people who speak Serbo-Croatian rare”? On the planet, yes. In Serbia, no. 1k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by Quora User promoted  by 23andMe Explore your DNA with 23andMe.

I have identical twin girls with red hair and blue eyes. How rare are they? Ask New Question Quora User , I fix sentences for a living. Answered Dec 21, 2017 · Author has 52 answers and 38.4k answer views I have red hair and blue eyes, and two of my daughters do as well. From our perspective, it isn’t rare, so I was interested to research this, and to see what the truth is. According to Medical Daily… The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. 5 Surprising Facts About Redheads That Make Them More Rare 16.9k Views · View Upvoters Quora User , Multicareer/degrees,BA to MSN, adj Yale fac, MOM,1981-NOW Answered Dec 27, 2017 · Author has 2.1k answers and 2.4m answer views It’s rare across the span of the entire world population, but there are places you can go where it’s not at all rare. I noticed this first when my daughter attended Fordham U. in NYC. Fordham has long been known as an Irish Catholic Jesuit run school. It attracts some of the best Catholic students in the metro NYC area, especially those interested in going into law, law enforcement, or specific government agencies. From my observations over 4 years of visits to the campus, it appears that at least 25% of the students have red hair, extremely fair skin, and some shade of blue eyes. Red hair is also much more common in Ireland and among the Irish population, along with blue or grey eyes. 525 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Comprehensive Cranium Care® Bald and buzzed heads deserve the best.

Both are recessive trait which means to have blue eyes and red hair colour one must have two copies of the recessive allele (for eye colour and hair colour) to express it.

According to studies, that means I have the rarest hair/eye combination, with less than 1% of the world’s population sharing that combination. I once had a childhood friend who was half Middle-Eastern, half Ashkenazi Jewish (quite the combination!) and had dark red hair, olive skin, and brown eyes. I’ve seen a few of the stereotypically freckled Irish reds, but the few I knew had green eyes, not blue. People would often ask me how I had red hair without freckles, and I responded with, “I’m not an Irish red.” Overall, I consider my red hair as a blessing, and I’m very proud of it. 1.9k Views · View Upvoters Quora User , Emeritus professor of biology Answered Dec 23, 2017 · Author has 5.7k answers and 2.5m answer views I Googled it and saw a number of sites saying red hair and blue eyes are the rarest combination of hair and eye color, and that most redheads have brown eyes, but these were all from popular, unreliable sources like Cosmopolitan magazine. Because it cites its sources, I trust this Wikipedia writer more (emphasis added): “ Red hair (or ginger hair ) occurs naturally in 1–2% of the human population . It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears most commonly in people with two copies of a recessive allele on chromosome 16 which produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. [1] Red hair varies in hues from a deep burgundy or bright copper (reddish-brown or auburn ) through to burnt orange or red-orange and strawberry blond . It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin . It is associated with fair skin color , lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel),  freckles , and sensitivity to ultraviolet light . [2] That writer’s reference 2 is: Valverde P, Healy E, Jackson I, Rees JL, Thody AJ (1995). "Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans" . Nature Genetics . 11 (3): 328–30. doi : 10.1038/ng1195-328 .

Just like for any trait, these features are more more common in some populations than they might be in others. My knowledge is more broad, so an eye colour geneticist may help you better than I can here, however my understanding is that red hair is a consequence of a recessive allele activity, and whilst eye colour is from many alleles working together, I presume there must be a recessive element to that too. Both of these traits are more common from Northern European Populations, and when I read the science - the standard paradigm was that both were adaptations to the reduced sunlight in northern climes - but there were new insights emerging, so that may have been revised by now? So… for the whole species, its fair to say that, yes they are ‘rare’, but some populations both will be very common indeed, including individuals with both of these traits. 366 Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by Quora User   Tony Solange Answered Dec 26, 2017 · Author has 600 answers and 252.1k answer views No. Red hair with blue eyes, and red hair and blue eyes respectively aren't rare because they are neither red nor blue. Both are brown. And, you can't get more not rare than brown, the most common eye color of humans. Consider: The blue eyes are an illusion. Like the blue sky is an illusion. The body doesn't created a blue pigmentation and therefore what you really see is very light brown eyes. The illusion of blue eyes is a result of Tyndall Scattering. [1] Red hair isn't red. See a pattern here? Red hair is really light brown hair. The red hair perception is caused by a gene mutation (the MCR1 or melacortin 1 receptor on chromosome 16). Working properly, MRC1 would produce brown hair.

By Susan Donaldson James  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Susan   March 17, 2014   0 Shares               Email      Star     Courtesy of Brian Braiker Brian Braiker, a banjo player in the band, the "DeLorean Sisters," is often mistaken as Irish because of his red hair.  0 Shares               Email      Redheads, as they say, wear the map of Ireland all over their faces. Sorry, ginger-haired English Prince Harry. And the statistics bear that stereotype out. Ireland has the highest per capita percentage of redheads in the world -- anywhere from 10 to 30 percent, according to Eupedia , a website that explores European genetics and ancestry. They are almost equally prevalent in Scotland and other pockets of Celtic pride. A slightly lower percentage hail from Cornwall in England and western parts of Switzerland. Red hair is associated with the gene MC1R, a recessive and somewhat rare gene that occurs in only about 2 percent of the world's population, according to the National Institutes of Health . That means both parents must carry a copy of the gene to produce a red-haired child and often the trait skips generations. Rarest of all are redheads with blue eyes. The majority have brown eyes or hazel or green shades. Brian Braiker, executive editor of Digiday , who answered an ABCNews.com call for redheads with, "Better red than dead," said he is "always" mistaken for an Irishman. Ethnically, he is nearly all Ashkenazi Jew, except for a maternal grandmother who is Norwegian. Not surprising. Why do you think they called the plundering Scandinavian Erik the Red? Genetic genealogy has revealed a high percentage of people from southwest Norway coincide with a paternal lineage known as haplogroup Rib-L21, including its subclade, Rib-M222, which is typical of northern Ireland. Genealogists speculate that may be because the Vikings took Celtic slaves from Ireland to that part of Norway. Braiker, 6-foot, 3-inches tall, with his brown eyes and full-fledged auburn beard, said he didn't have an easy time of it growing up a redhead. His coloring was nothing like his dark-haired father and light-haired mother. "I endured jokes, 'Are you the milkman's son?' and 'Were you adopted,'" Braiker, 39, told ABCNews.com. The gene apparently skipped a generation or two, as he confides his father's grandfather and a maternal cousin also had red hair. One ancestry company, BritainsDNA , now offers parents the chance to see if they carry the recessive gene by sending in their saliva for testing. If both do, they have a one in four chance of conceiving a redhead. BritainsDNA conducted the biggest study of redhead genetics in the country, with more than 2,300 people who have undergone DNA tests. Redheads like Braiker are more sensitive to hot and cold . And one 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed they need about 20 percent more anesthesia to knock them out for surgery. "I have had dental work and a graft done years ago on the roof of my mouth and it is still sensitive to temperature," he said. "I have also been a life-long wussy." Redheads are also better at making their own vitamin D, which helps protect against osteoporosis, because their bodies are more efficient at soaking up sunlight, according to Yahoo Health . Scottish researcher Jonathan Rees suggests the "ginger gene" may have helped protect redheads from rickets. According to an article in Huffington Post UK , redheads share some other interesting traits: their hair is harder to dye than other shades; they have fewer, but thicker strands of hair' and they go gray more slowly. But there are also health disadvantages. The color of human skin, hair and eyes is dictated by two types of melanin pigment that are produced in the upper layers of the skin: pheomelanin, which is reddish-yellow, and eumelanin, which is brownish-black.    A 2012 study from the journal Nature , found that the pigment pheomelanin, which gives hair the red color, makes redheads more susceptible to the melanoma than fair-skinned blonds, even when they cover up their skin. "What happens in the sun?" asked Braiker. "I stay out of it. The sun is not my friend. I get more freckles and I should wear a ridiculously high SPF on my face." Growing up had its challenges, he said, but eventually there were social advantages to being a redhead. "Over a lifetime, I have developed thick skin," said Braiker. "Growing up I was advanced a year in kindergarten or grade 1," he explained. "So I was a year younger with red hair and a little bit weaker than the rest. I was easy prey." He grew his hair long in college, even sporting a red afro, and continued to get cat calls from strangers: "What's up carrot top?" and "Ronald McDonald." But, he said, it made him tougher. "I always felt a little bit like a freak," said Braiker. "But over time, I learned to embrace the weirdness and it did help shape my personality. ... And there are definitely ladies who like redheads."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

Both red hair and pale skin are caused by recessive MC1R sequence variants, and are closely related. Because of the mutation in MC1R, red heads have low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body, which leads to both pale skin and red hair (since the red pigment pheomelanin overpowers the low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin). 6.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

I used to have some as a kid, but I don't have it anymore (I'm redhead). Red hair - Biochemistry and genetics : The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair and non-tanning skin is also associated with freckles , though it is not uncommon to see a redhead without freckles. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant, and the prevalence of these alleles is highest in Scotland and Ireland . The alleles that code for red hair occur close to the alleles that affect skin color, so it seems that the phenotypic expression for lighter skin and red hair are interrelated. Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child. Valverde P, Healy E, Jackson I, Rees JL, Thody AJ (1995). "Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans" . Nature Genetics  11 (3): 328–30. doi : 10.1038/ng1195-328 . PMID  7581459 Abstract: Melanin pigmentation protects the skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). There are two types of melanin, the red phaeome-lanin and the black eumelanin, both of which are present in human skin. Eumelanin is photoprotective whereas phaeomelanin, because of its potential to generate free radicals in response to UVR2, may contribute to UV-induced skin damage. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of phaeomelain in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from UVR1. In mammals the relative proportions of phaeomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), which acts via its receptor (MC1R), on melanocytes, to increase the synthesis of eumelanin3,4 and the product of the agouti locus which antagonises this action5. In mice, mutations at either the MC1R gene or agouti affect the pattern of melanogene-sis resulting in changes in coat colour. We now report the presence of MC1R gene sequence variants in humans. These were found in over 80% of individuals with red hair and/or fair skin that tans poorly but in fewer than 20% of individuals with brown or black hair and in less than 4% of those who showed a good tanning response. Our findings suggest that in humans, as in other mammals, the MC1R is a control point in the regulation of pigmentation phenotype and, more importantly, that variations in this protein are associated with a poor tanning response. 3.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Redheads today are commonly associated with the Celtic nations [4] and to a far lesser extent the Germanic peoples.  In Ireland , the percentage of population with red hair is estimated to be at around 10%, [5] making it the most red-haired country in the world. According to Britain's DNA, 34.7% of the Irish population carry the allele for red hair, although this doesn't directly translate proportionally into births of red-haired children. [6]  Scotland also has a very high percentage with around 6% of the population having red hair. [7] [8] Dr. Jim Wilson of Britain's DNA study used a sample of 2,343 people, and found red hair occurrence of 6% in Scotland, with 35% overall carrying the allele and Edinburgh having the highest proportion at 40%. [7] [8] [9] The largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland, which analysed over 500,000 people, found the percentage of Scots with red hair to be 5.3%. [10]  England has a red hair prevalence of around 4%, with 28.5% of population having the allele; [7] while in Wales 38% of Welsh people carry the red-haired allele. [7] A 1956 study of hair colour among British Army recruits from Great Britain found higher levels of red hair in Wales and the Scottish border counties of England . [fn 1] [11]  Eastern and Southern Europe     A Roman fresco depicting Bacchus with red hair, Boscoreale , c. 30 BC    Carleton Coon's 1939 book The Races of Europe stated that rufosity (reddish hair) often occurred in Montenegrins . [12] [13] [14]  In Italy , red hair is found at a frequency of 0.57% of the total population, without variation in frequency across the different regions of the country. [15] In Sardinia, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.24% of the population. [15]  Victorian era  ethnographers considered the Udmurt people of the Volga to be "the most red-headed men in the world", [16] a claim which has a solid basis even today, as the Volga region has more redheads per population than anywhere else in the world with the exception of Ireland . [17]  North Africa and Mediterranean      Hades abducting Persephone , fresco in the small royal tomb at Vergina , Macedonia, Greece , c. 340 BC    The Berber populations of Morocco [18] and northern Algeria have occasional redheads. Red hair frequency is especially significant among the Riffians from Morocco and Kabyles from Algeria, [19] [20] [21] respectively. The Queen of Morocco , Lalla Salma wife of king Mohammed VI , has red hair. Abd ar-Rahman I also had red hair, his mother being a Christian Berber slave.  Red hair is also found amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish populations. [22] In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair. [23] Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards . [24] In European culture, prior to the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition , all those with red hair were identified as Jewish. [25] In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair. [27] The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia. [28]  Asia (all regions)     A Uyghur girl in Kashgar , China 's Xinjiang region, with auburn hair    In Asia, genetic red hair is rare, but reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair can be found in the Levant ( Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine ), in Turkey , in Caucasia , in Northern Kazakhstan , among Uyghurs and among Indo-Iranians . [ editorializing ] The use of henna on hair and skin for various reasons occasionally occurs in Asia. When henna is used on hair it dyes the hair to different shades of red. [29] [30]  Americas, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa  Emigration from Europe has multiplied the population of red haired humans in the Americas , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . In the United States , it is estimated that 2–6% of the population has red hair. This would give the U.S. the largest population of redheads in the world, at 6 to 18 million, compared to approximately 420,000 in Ireland and 300,000 in Scotland. [7]  Historical     Woman with mixed reddish-brown hair, Papua New Guinea . Melanesians have a significant incidence of mixed-fair hair, caused by a genetic mutation different from European blond and red hair. [31]    Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red-haired. [32] The ancient peoples Budini and Sarmatians are also reported by Greek author to be blue-eyed and red-haired, and the latter even owe their names to it. [33] [34]  In Asia, red hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians , who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China . Caucasian  Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC . [35]  Reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair is also found amongst some Polynesians , and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture reddish hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high-ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership. [36] [37]  Biochemistry and genetics     A close-up view of red hair        Roman fresco of a woman with red hair wearing a garland of olives, from Herculaneum , made sometime before the city's destruction in 79 AD by Mount Vesuvius (which also destroyed Pompeii).    The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.  The genetics of red hair, discovered in 1997, appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome  16 . Red hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer.  The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is unable to tan . Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, freckles are a common but not all-inclusive feature of red-haired people. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant [2] .  Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child.  Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not always sufficient, for red hair production. [38]  Genetics  The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His , and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. [39] The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA ) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. [40] [41]  In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms.  Evolution  Origins  Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin. [42] In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm untanned skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads can become more common through genetic drift . [39]  Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago. [43] [44]  A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans. [45]  Extinction hoax  See also: Disappearing blonde gene  A 2007 report in The Courier-Mail , which cited the National Geographic magazine and unnamed "geneticists", said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future. [46] Other blogs and news sources ran similar stories that attributed the research to the magazine or the "Oxford Hair Foundation". However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter & Gamble , and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The National Geographic article in fact states "while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn't going away". [47]  Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive allele (variant of a gene), the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future. [47]  Medical implications of the red hair gene  Melanoma  Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through suntanning , but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage . Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability. [48] It has been found that Europeans who are heterozygous for red hair exhibit increased sensitivity to UV radiation. [49]  Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person's health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma . [50] [51]  Pain tolerance and injury  Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain compared to people with other hair colors. One study found that people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels), [52] while another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain. [53] [54] [55]  Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic . [56] Other research publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men. [57] A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide . [55]  The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation-driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain-relieving endorphins . (Both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC , and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH. [58] Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin , but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. [58] Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some crosstalk between the POMC hormones; this may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.  There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications. [59] [60] One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising . [60]  Red hair of pathological origin  Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder:   In cases of severe malnutrition , normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde . The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor , is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine .  One variety of albinism (Type 3, a.k.a. rufous albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea , results in red hair and red-colored skin. [61]  Red hair is found on people lacking pro-opiomelanocortin . [61] [62]   Culture     Most likely a posthumous painted portrait of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt with red hair and her distinct facial features, wearing a royal diadem and pearl-studded hairpins, from Roman Herculaneum , late 1st-century BC to mid-1st century AD [63]       Polychrome Roman marble statue depicting the goddess Tyche holding the infant Plutus in her arms, 2nd century AD, Istanbul Archaeological Museum    In various times and cultures, red hair has been prized, feared, and ridiculed.      Portrait of a Lady , ca. 1470–1475, by Sandro Botticelli        Elizabeth I of England , ca. 1588    Beliefs about temperament  A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In Anne of Green Gables , a character says of Anne Shirley , the redheaded heroine, that "her temper matches her hair", while in The Catcher in the Rye , Holden Caulfield remarks that "People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie [his dead brother] never did, and he had very red hair."  During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a sanguine temperament . [64] In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda , redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament.  Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of Gulliver's Travels , "A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms ," when he writes that: "It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity." Swift goes on to write that "neither was the hair of this brute [a Yahoo ] of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe". [65] Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero . They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of "criminal women" were redheads. [66]  Media, fashion and art     "The Accolade" by Edmund Blair Leighton    Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman , Alyson Hannigan , Marcia Cross , Christina Hendricks , Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye. [ citation needed ]  Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India , Iran , Bangladesh and Pakistan , henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance. [67]  Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color " Titian " takes its name from the artist Titian , who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli 's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites , Edmund Leighton , Modigliani , [68] and Gustav Klimt . [69]  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes story " The Red-Headed League " (1891) involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film DuBarry Was a Lady featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor .  Notable fictional characters with red hair includes Red Sonja , Mystique , and Poison Ivy . [70]  Prejudice and discrimination against redheads  Medieval beliefs      Barbarossa (Redbeard), Ottoman Admiral    Red hair was thought to be a mark of a beastly sexual desire and moral degeneration. A savage red-haired man is portrayed in the fable by Grimm brothers ( Der Eisenhans ) as the spirit of the forest of iron. Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper , in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk . [71]  Montague Summers, in his translation of the Malleus Maleficarum , [72] notes that red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch , a werewolf or a vampire during the Middle Ages;   Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires. It is significant that in ancient Egypt, as Manetho tells us, human sacrifices were offered at the grave of Osiris, and the victims were red-haired men who were burned, their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowing-fans. It is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest, red-hair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn. But these men were called Typhonians, and were representatives not of Osiris but of his evil rival Typhon, whose hair was red.   Medieval antisemitism      Fagin in a watercolour by 'Kyd'    During the Spanish Inquisition , people of red hair were identified as Jewish and isolated for persecution. [25] In Medieval Italy and Spain, red hair was associated with the heretical nature of Jews and their rejection of Jesus , and thus Judas Iscariot was commonly depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair, with red-hair being given by the authors to villainous Jewish characters such as Shylock and Fagin . [27] The antisemitic association persisted into modern times in Soviet Russia. [28] The medieval prejudice against red-hair may have derived from the Ancient biblical tradition, in relation to biblical figures such as Esau and King David . The Ancient historian Josephus would mistranslate the Hebrew Torah to describe the more positive figure of King David as 'golden haired', in contrast to the negative figure of Esau , even though the original Hebrew Torah implies that both King David and Esau had 'fiery red hair'. [73]  Modern-day discrimination  "Carrot head" redirects here. For the French novel, see Poil de carotte .  In his 1885 book I Say No , Wilkie Collins wrote "The prejudice against habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair."  In his 1895 memoir and history The Gurneys of Earlham , Augustus John Cuthbert Hare described an incident of harassment: "The second son, John, was born in 1750. As a boy he had bright red hair, and it is amusingly recorded that one day in the streets of Norwich a number of boys followed him, pointing to his red locks and saying, "Look at that boy; he's got a bonfire on the top of his head," and that John Gurney was so disgusted that he went to a barber's, had his head shaved, and went home in a wig. He grew up, however, a remarkably attractive-looking young man." [74]  In British English , the word "ginger" is sometimes used to describe red-headed people (at times in an insulting manner), [75] with terms such as "gingerphobia" [76] and "gingerism" [77] used by the British media. In Britain, redheads are also sometimes referred to disparagingly as "carrot tops" and "carrot heads". (The comedian " Carrot Top " uses this stage name .) "Gingerism" has been compared to racism , although this is widely disputed, and bodies such as the UK Commission for Racial Equality do not monitor cases of discrimination and hate crimes against redheads. [77]  Nonetheless, individuals and families in Britain are targeted for harassment and violence because of their hair colour. In 2003, a 20-year-old was stabbed in the back for "being ginger". [78] In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; [79] in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne , was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crime on account of their red hair. [80] In May 2009, a schoolboy committed suicide after being bullied for having red hair. [81] In 2013, a fourteen-year-old boy in Lincoln had his right arm broken and his head stamped on by three men who attacked him "just because he had red hair". The three men were subsequently jailed for a combined total of ten years and one month for the attack. [82]  This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. The British comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series The Catherine Tate Show . The sketch saw fictional character Sandra Kemp , who was forced to seek solace in a refuge for ginger people because she had been ostracised from society. [83] The British comedy Bo' Selecta! (starring redhead Leigh Francis ) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people. (Hucknall, who says that he has repeatedly faced prejudice or been described as ugly on account of his hair colour, argues that Gingerism should be described as a form of racism. [84] [85] ) Comedian Tim Minchin , himself a redhead, also covered the topic in his song "Prejudice". [86]  The pejorative use of the word "ginger" and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the " Ginger Kids ", " Le Petit Tourette ", " It's a Jersey Thing " and " Fatbeard " episodes of South Park .  Film and television programmes often portray school bullies as having red hair. [87] However, children with red hair are often themselves targeted by bullies; "Somebody with ginger hair will stand out from the crowd," says anti-bullying expert Louise Burfitt-Dons . [88]  In Australian slang , redheads are often nicknamed "Blue" or "Bluey". [89] More recently, they have been referred to as "rangas" (a word derived from the red-haired ape, the orangutan), sometimes with derogatory connotations. [90] The word "rufus" has been used in both Australian and British slang to refer to red-headed people; [91] based on a variant of rufous , a reddish-brown color.  In November 2008 social networking website Facebook received criticism after a 'Kick a Ginger' group, which aimed to establish a "National Kick a Ginger Day" on 20 November, acquired almost 5,000 members. A 14-year-old boy from Vancouver who ran the Facebook group was subjected to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for possible hate crimes. [92]  In December 2009 British supermarket chain Tesco withdrew a Christmas card which had the image of a child with red hair sitting on the lap of Santa Claus , and the words: " Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones " after customers complained the card was offensive. [93]  In October 2010, Harriet Harman , the former Equality Minister in the British government under Labour, faced accusations of prejudice after she described the red-haired Treasury secretary Danny Alexander as a "ginger rodent". [94] Alexander responded to the insult by stating that he was "proud to be ginger". [95] Harman was subsequently forced to apologise for the comment, after facing criticism for prejudice against a minority group. [96]  In September 2011, Cryos International, one of the world's largest sperm banks , announced that it would no longer accept donations from red-haired men due to low demand from women seeking artificial insemination . [97]  Use of term in Singapore and Malaysia  The term ang mo ( Chinese : 红毛 ; pinyin : hóng máo ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : âng-mo͘ ) in Hokkien ( Min Nan ) Chinese means "red-haired", [98] and is used in Malaysia and Singapore to refer to white people. The epithet is sometimes rendered as ang mo kui ( 红毛鬼 ) meaning "red-haired devil", similar to the Cantonese term gweilo ("foreign devil"). Thus it is viewed as racist and derogatory by some people. [99] Others, however, maintain it is acceptable. [100] Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as The Straits Times , [101] and in television programmes and films.  The Chinese characters for ang mo are the same as those in the historical Japanese term Kōmō ( 紅毛 ), which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for Dutch or Northern European people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during Sakoku , its 200-year period of isolation. [102]  Red hair festivals     Hundreds of redheads together at the Redhead Day , September 2007    There has been an annual Redhead Day festival in the Netherlands that attracts red-haired participants from around the world. The festival is paid for by the local government in Breda, a city in the south east of the Netherlands. [103] It attracts participants from over 80 different countries. The international event began in 2005, when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads. Today, the festival includes music, fashion shows, art exhibitions and a picnic [104]  The Irish Redhead Convention, held in late August in County Cork since 2011, claims to be a global celebration and attracts people from several continents. The celebrations include crowning the ginger King and Queen, competitions for the best red eyebrows and most freckles per square inch, orchestral concerts and carrot throwing competitions. [105]  A smaller red-hair day festival is held since 2013 by the UK's anti bullying alliance in London, with the aim of instilling pride in having red-hair. [106]  Since 2014, a red-hair event is held in Israel, at Kibbutz Gezer (Carrot) , held for the local Israeli red hair community, [107] including both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi red-heads. [108] However, the number of attendees has to be restricted due to the risk of rocket attacks, leading to anger in the red-hair community. [109] The organizers state; "The event is a good thing for many redheads, who had been embarrassed about being redheads before.” [109]  The first and only festival for red heads in the United States was launched in 2015. Held in Highwood, Illinois, Redhead Days draws participants from across the United States. [110]  Religious and mythological traditions  In the Iliad , Achilles ' hair is described as ξανθῆς [111] ( ksanthēs ) , usually translated as blonde, or golden [112] but sometimes as red or tawny. [113] [114] His son Neoptolemus also bears the name Pyrrhus, a possible reference to his own red hair. [115]  The Norse god Thor is usually described as having red hair. [116]     Mary Magdalene is commonly portrayed with long red hair, as in this painting by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys    The Hebrew word usually translated "ruddy" or "reddish-brown" ( admoni  אדמוני , from the root ADM אדם , see also Adam and Edom ) [117] [118] [119] [120] was used to describe both Esau and David .  Early artistic representations of Mary Magdalene usually depict her as having long flowing red hair, although a description of her hair color was never mentioned in the Bible, and it is possible the color is an effect caused by pigment degradation in the ancient paint.  Judas Iscariot is also represented with red hair in Spanish culture [121] [122] and in the works of William Shakespeare , [123] reinforcing the negative stereotype.

I'm a mutant. You're a mutant, too.     Author:   alle   Publish date:  October 3, 2013    Tags:  Tags:  eyelashes , science , red hair , redheads , genetics , freckles , eyes , blue eyes , chins , heterochomia , mutations                    If I wasn’t a writer, I think I’d like to be a genetic researcher. I know, they seem like totally unrelated fields, but hear me out.  The thing that interests me most in the entire world is why people (or characters) are who they are, and what makes them tick. And one of the things at the very bottom of what makes people tick is in their genes, and I think that’s why I find genetics so interesting. I love picking out the features that I inherited from my parents (my dad’s eyes, my mum’s cheekbones) as well as those that haven’t appeared for several generations (my hair texture).  Since humans are around 99.9% genetically identical, it’s amazing to think that such a tiny percentage difference can result in such incredible variation in our species. And one of the vehicles for that variation is genetic mutation.  Unfortunately, we’re not yet mutating the power of flight or telepathy--sorry, Doctor X. A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA structure of a gene. They can be inherited or acquired, and they can be beneficial, neutral or pathogenic (seldom are they superpowers). Some mutations eventually become so common that they’re considered “normal,” and then we call them polymorphs, whereas others remain rare and unusual in the human population.  Because this is a beauty site, I’ve picked seven physical mutations to write about. Some of them are considered polymorphs and some aren’t, but they all make us uniquely beautiful.  And who knows--maybe someday I’ll get that adamantium skeleton I’ve been asking Santa for since I was six.   HETEROCHROMIA  I never thought much about my eyes growing up. They were very much like my dad’s, and I figured that having blue, yellow and green all mixed up together was just what green eyes looked like.       Imagine my surprise to find out that this is actually quite atypical, and all thanks to a mutation called heterochromia iridum . It refers to eyes that have multiple colours in them, and you’ve probably heard of it if you’ve seen X Men: First Class ; young Professor X calls it “a very groovy mutation.”       There are three types of heterochromia:  Complete (each eye a different colour).  Sectoral (a segment of contrasting colour in the iris).  Central (a different colour radiating out from the pupil).        These three categories are pretty fluid, though, and they can combine in weird and wonderful ways. My left eye is far lighter and more yellow than my right, while my right eye has The Blotch. Both have rings of grey and yellow around the pupil.  I guess this is why I always get attitude at the DMV when I tell them my eyes are green.  If you’re born with heterochromia, it’s probably because one of your parents had it--it’s a dominant autosomal trait. Though you could also be a chimera (two fertilised eggs fusing into one zygote, each with a different gene for eye colour) or a mosaic (someone with two or more different genetic codes in their cells; in this case, a slightly altered gene responsible for eye colour).  It’s also possible to acquire heterochromia, although you probably don’t want to. It’s almost always the result of a serious illness or injury . Certain medications have been known to deposit brown pigment in eyes --a pretty rare side-effect, and one that usually only happens in hazel eyes, but certainly one worth mentioning.  Most sources I consulted say that heterochromia is super-rare, but from my very scientific study of xoVainers (both readers and writers), I’ve determined that it really ISN’T rare at all. It seems like most of us have some form of this, with central being the most popular. Multicoloured eyes, unite!   DOUBLE EYELASHES  I had to include this after Hannah’s outstanding Elizabeth Taylor tutorial , because Liz Taylor was famous for her super-dark, gorgeous double eyelashes.  It’s called distichiasis , and if you’re born with it, it’s because one of your parents had it (it’s a dominant trait, so you’re welcome, future offspring). It’s the result of a transcription error on your 16th chromosome, and can also be a symptom of some pretty serious heart-related disorders .  This is another fun mutation expressed in my phenotype. It’s not as obvious on me as it is on some people, because my eyelashes are blonde. But man, do I ever have a lot of them.  There is a difference, though, between having “lots of eyelashes” and a double row, and it can difficult to figure out if you have this particular mutation or not . Google is very little help, except to be absolutely disgusting (seriously, is there anything grosser than gross eye pictures?). So today I’m going to be better than Web MD.  Here’s how you can tell: Lift up the lashes on your upper eyelid and peek underneath where the waterline is. If your eyelashes stop and then your waterline starts, you have beautiful thick lashes. If, however, you can see lashes sprouting out of your waterline where they should not be (I find this incredibly distressing), then congratulations, you have distichiasis.       Anecdotally, this isn’t always the super-gorgeous advantage that it sounds like. I had to have seven eyelashes that were growing in towards my eye removed when I was a kid, which, thankfully, I only have vague memories of now.  Another way to tell is to go to a new eye doctor for a checkup. If they say “Damn, what’s going on HERE?” then congratulations, and may the spirit of Liz Taylor be with you.   RED HAIR  I think most people know that red hair is a recessive trait; meaning that if you’re a ginger (term used with lots of love), you have two variant copies of a gene called MC1R on each of your 16th chromosomes. This mutation results in generally fairer skin, freckles (we’ll get to them), light-coloured eyes, issues dealing with UV light and, recent studies have suggested, a unique pain tolerance .  That’s all pretty neat, but I want to talk about a totally false idea that regains popularity every couple of years: that redheads are going extinct, and that there will be no more gingers as early as 2060.  No. Just no.        How Stuff Works debunked this very, very thoroughly : “Recessive genes can become rare but don't disappear completely unless everyone carrying that gene dies or fails to reproduce. So while red hair may remain rare, enough people carry the gene that, barring global catastrophe, redheads should continue to appear for some time.”  So the next time your Facebook friends all start posting nonsense about the looming Gingerpocalypse, just send them a link to this article and settle their hash. Then reread Anne of Green Gables and feel pleased that all is right with the world.   FRECKLES  I have a few freckles, and I think they are the cutest. I always wished that I had more, probably because a lot of my friends growing up had them.       And guess what causes them? Or rather, guess what partially causes them?  That’s right: MUTATIONS.  And it all has to do with cells in the skin that make pigment called melanocytes. When exposed to UV light, melanocytes produce melanin, which makes skin darker to protect our DNA. There are two main types of melanin--eumelanin and pheomelanin. Pheomelanin is less common, and it’s what gives red hair and freckles their orangey tone.  Remember a second ago when we were talking about red hair and the MC1R gene? That guy is coming back into play again here. When the MC1R gene is working normally, it turns all pheomelanin into eumelanin. This means skin tans instead of freckles, and hair is a colour other than red. But when the MC1R gene isn’t working, you get red hair and freckled skin thanks to all that lovely pheomelanin floating around.  “But Alle,” I hear you saying. “Not all people who have freckles also have red hair.”  You’re so right! Remember how we know that being a ginger is a recessive trait that needs two copies of a gene--one from each parent--to be expressed?   (WARNING: SEASON SIX DOCTOR WHO SPOILER APPROACHING IN THE NEXT GRAPHIC. IF RIVER SONG IS STILL A MYSTERY TO YOU, PLEASE LOOK AWAY NOW.)       MCR1 is that gene! Some people have a single mutated copy of it and have no idea--but it means that not all their pheomelanin changes to eumelanin, and they still get freckles when exposed to UV light. My family hasn’t ever had any redheads in it--we’re generally either dark blondes or have black Irish hair--but I, and a few of my cousins, still have freckles. It could be that we’re carrying a single redhead gene , makin’ pheomelanin like it’s our JOBS.  Or it could be something else entirely, because this only applies SOMETIMES. Not all people with red hair have freckles (though it’s more likely) and, as we know, not all people with freckles also have red hair. Something else is afoot, but scientists don’t know what it is yet. Another gene doing something? Environment? Epigenetics? No idea!  This is a super-weird result, because it tells us that freckles are a dominant trait, being expressed even when there’s only one copy of the gene in question, but red hair itself is recessive-- even though they’re both caused by the same gene . Genetics is really cool and complicated, guys.   BLUE EYES  I know: WHAAAAAAAA? Blue eyes aren’t exactly rare! But mutations don’t have to be rare--this one now appears in so much of the population that it's considered a polymorph. But really, blue eyes are the result of a pretty recent mutation. You know, 10,000 years ago. Practically yesterday.       The first thing you gotta know is that blue eyes aren’t technically a colour-- they’re a lack of colour. Eye colour is determined by pigments in the part of the iris called the stroma, and if there is a tiny amount of pigment there (or none at all), eyes will appear blue. A bit more pigment gives us green eyes. And if there’s heaps of pigment, eyes are brown.  The gene that’s responsible for this is called OCA2, and it controls melanin. Back in the day, all humans had brown eyes--eyes with lots of melanin pigment. One day, a nearby gene mutated and started to limit OCA2’s ability to produce melanin in the iris. This stopped melanin from colouring the eyes, leaving the stroma blue, and voila! Blue eyes appeared in the population.  In fact, scientists currently think that everyone who has blue eyes is descended from a single common individual who lived around the Black Sea six to ten thousand years ago. How’s that for neat?   CLEFT CHIN  Cleft chins are caused when the two halves of the jaw bone (or muscle) don’t quite fuse properly during development. A lot of reeeeeally attractive people have cleft chins, so please excuse me while I indulge in some eye candy.       Common wisdom-- and also Wikipedia --states that this is a primarily dominant genetic trait.  Allow me to bust this myth.  First: not all cleft chins are exactly the same. There’s heaps of variation when it comes to size (round dimples, eg: Kirk Douglas, vs Y-shaped clefts, eg: Aaron Ekhart) and depth (very subtle vs very deep). So it’s sometimes harder than you’d think to say which chin is smooth and which isn’t.  Second: men are more frequently butt-chinned than women are, which doesn’t fit the simple dominant-recessive genetic model. A really old study (from 1939) recorded that 9.6% of German men and 4.5% of German women had cleft chins. That’s a really big difference between sexes for a trait that isn’t supposed to be sex-linked.   Another study (from 1960) found that even when two parents had smooth chins, they could still have cleft-chinned offspring. It didn’t happen often (11% of the time), but it happened. If cleft chins truly are dominant, this should have been impossible.  So basically, if Alexander Skarsgard and I ever had a kid, there’s a chance it would have a cleft chin--but it’s not a certainty.       That’s a little disappointing, honestly.   NO-SHOW WISDOM TEETH  If there's one thing I wish would just DIE RIGHT OUT OF THE HUMAN POPULATION, it would be wisdom teeth. Mine popped up when I was 20, all four completely on their sides, two of them poking through the gums like painful little islands in a sea of pink gum.  There’s a lot of variation when it comes to how people recover after wisdom teeth surgery--I did not have a great time. I honestly hope that not many of you guys know what dry sockets are, because they are the worst and most horrible things.  When I cursed my horrible teeth to my dad, he got really quiet and said “I never had those.”  Yep. My dad is one of the lucky ones who was born without wisdom teeth.       As things are right now, we aren’t totally sure that this is a mutation, because we’re not sure why wisdom teeth don’t show up (even though it happens in an estimated 35% of the population) . Is there a gene that says “NO, WISDOM TEETH, DO NOT GROW HERE”? A bunch of genes? Is it due to environmental factors? Some kind of physical injury in childhood that prevents them from forming? Nobody knows for sure!  There’s some recent evidence that the suppression of wisdom teeth was a mutation that popped up in China three to four hundred THOUSAND years ago . This doesn’t prove anything, but it sure is interesting to think that my dad is possibly the beneficiary of a four-hundred-thousand-year-old mutation.  Although if the point of variation like this is to pass them down to your children, that didn’t work out very well. Both my brother and I had fully impacted wisdom teeth followed by painful surgeries and long recoveries. Wahmp wahmp.  Which of these mutations do you have? What other genetic traits do you have? If you had to pick an X Men-style superpower, which one would it be? I always wanted to be Storm because of her awesome hair and ability to fly, but I’d totally settle for being Professor X if it meant I could hang out with Patrick Stewart.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       I have red hair and blue eyes, both of my parents have blue eyes but light brown hair, My husband had dark brown hair and dark brown eyes, his parents both have dark brown hair and his mom has blue eyes and his dad has brown...my question is, if we have a child what are its chances of having blue eyes or red hair?        -A curious adult from Ohio   February 16, 2006  The chances for green or blue eyes are around 50% ( click here for the details). The chances for red hair depend entirely on whether or not your husband carries a hidden red hair gene. If he does, then there is most likely a 50-50 shot for a redhead. If he doesn't, then the chances are close to zero ( click here for more details).  So, if your husband is a carrier for red hair, then your chances for a redhead with blue or green eyes is 1 in 4 (we separate out the two below). If he isn't a carrier, then chances are pretty close to zero for a blue-eyed child with red hair. Let's see where I got those numbers.   Eye color : As I said earlier, your chances for a child with blue or green eyes are around 50%. These chances are based on an eye color model where two genes determine eye color.  The first gene is the brown-blue gene, bey2. It comes in two forms, a brown (B) and a blue one (b). Brown is dominant over blue which means if either or both of your copies of this gene are B, then you have brown eyes (remember, we have two copies of most of our genes -- one from mom and one from dad).  OK, so we know you are for sure bb (both copies are blue); that is the only way to get blue eyes. And we know your husband has at least one B since he has brown eyes.  But what about the other copy of his brown-blue gene? It is often hard to figure out if someone is a blue eye carrier. However, because his mom has blue eyes, we know he got a b from her. In other words, he is Bb -- a brown-eyed carrier of blue eyes.  So what does this mean for your children? It means that you will always pass a blue eye version (b) and that your husband will pass one onto his kids half the time. Your kids have a 50-50 shot of not having brown eyes.  We can't rule out that they'll have green eyes, though. This is because there is a 2nd gene, a green-blue gene (gey) that is involved as well. It comes in two forms, a green (G) and a blue (b) one.  One more thing, the brown version of bey2 is dominant over the green version of gey, which is dominant over the blue versions of both genes. In other words, brown trumps green and blue, and green trumps blue.  We don't know your husband's green gene status because we don't know his dad's green gene status (we know yours because you have blue eyes). Because his mom had blue eyes, we know she is bb for the green-blue gene. Which means your husband has at least one b.  If your husband is Gb, then each child has a 1 in 4 chance for blue eyes, a 1 in 4 chance for green, and a 1 in 2 chance for brown. If he is bb for the green-blue gene, then your kids have a 50-50 shot at blue and a 50-50 shot at brown eyes. Our answer here hopefully makes this all more clear.  Your two possible eye color scenarios:  1) Your husband is a carrier for green eyes (BbGb)    2) Your husband is not a carrier for green eyes (Bbbb)     A word of warning. As complicated as this is, it doesn't explain everything about eye color. There are cases where blue-eyed parents have green or brown-eyed kids even though this is impossible by this model.  These sorts of things happen often enough that it probably isn't due just to new mutations in their eye color genes. There are probably genes we just don't know about that are involved in eye color. Click here to learn about how these might work.   Red hair : Red hair is often a very simple dominant/recessive case. What I mean is that a certain gene called MC1R comes in two forms, a nonred (R) and a red (r) form. R is dominant over r.  As a redhead, you are rr, you will always pass a red hair gene down to your kids. But what about your husband? He could be either an RR or an Rr, it is impossible to know right now.  Well, that isn't strictly true. If he could have one gene, MC1R, sequenced, he would have a pretty good idea about whether or not he is a carrier. Unfortunately, no one is currently offering this service*. Some, but not all carriers of the red hair gene have freckles so this can be a hint. But there are people without freckles who carry a red hair gene too (me, for example).  So, let's say your husband is a carrier. Then we are in a similar position to blue eyes. You will always pass on an r version of the MC1R gene. All of your kids will at least be carriers.  Your husband has a 50-50 shot of passing on the red hair version, r. Those kids that get the r from your husband will be redheads. Those who get the R will be carriers.  If your husband is RR, then most likely none of your kids will end up redheads. They will all be carriers of the red hair gene (from you) but not redheads themselves.  OK, so let's put it all together:  Husband genotype  Chance for Red hair/Blue eyes   Bb Gb Rr  1 in 8 (12.5%)   Bb bb Rr  1 in 4 (25%)   Bb Gb RR  Little or none   Bb bb RR  Little or none  Now again, none of this is as simple as I've stated so far. There are some people with red hair whose MC1R gene has no DNA changes. So there are other genes that can cause red hair as well. And there are some DNA changes in only one copy of MC1R that appear to cause red hair even when the other copy has no changes.  However, from the work done thus far, the idea that you end up with red hair when both copies of your MC1R gene are mutated explains around 2/3 of red hair. Pretty good by genetic standards!

By: Rosemary O. Fernandez Around this time last year, I got the best news of my life: My husband and I were expecting a baby! We kept it to ourselves for a while, but soon told our family and friends. As I inevitably expanded, I was asked the inevitable question: Will the little one have red hair too? This was a perfectly reasonable question as I was born with screaming red hair –the kind of shade that has prompted numerous strangers to tell me I have the map of Ireland written on my face despite the fact that I’m mostly Italian. I inherited these locks from my (Italian) mother, and my husband’s mother and grandfather are also gingers. Needless to say, the odds were in the little guy’s favor. Thirty-eight weeks slugged by, and I’d estimate that I heard the question about three times a week. Coworkers joked about it. Family members hoped for it. Random people at the grocery store thought it would be terrific. Naturally all my husband and I prayed for was a healthy child. Whether he popped out with red, blonde, brown, or green hair, we’d cuddle and dote on him just the same. But I’d be lying if I said I never crossed my fingers and daydreamed about strolling down the street with a fiery-headed toddler in tow. Here are some facts to see if  you will have a redhead baby: 1. In order for a baby to have red hair, both parents have to carry the gene, since it’s a recessive trait. So if you’re a ginger and you marry a ginger, odds are, your kids will be gingers, too. If only one parent has the locks but the other is a carrier, the baby’s chances are 50/50. If neither of you are red but you both are carriers, you have a one in four chance of a fiery-haired child. And, sorry to say, if only one parent is not a carrier (even though the other is), you’ve got no shot. [ Source ] 2. Even though you might not be a redhead yourself, studies estimate that 25 percent of Caucasian Americans carry the ginger gene, so if you fall into this category you might end up with a redheaded baby when you’re least expecting it. [ Source ] READ: 10 Things To Know If You’re a Redhead Baby My reasons weren’t purely aesthetic, because for me, my hair color is a huge part of my personality. I’m confident. I’m intelligent. I’m friendly. I’m funny (though my husband says it’s usually when I don’t mean to be). Growing up, my hair helped me cultivate these qualities. I’m used to strangers addressing me simply because they want to pay me a compliment about my hair; therefore I have no problem doing the same to someone else when I like their outfit or a speech they presented. On the first day of school when teachers called my name, they also told me they liked my hair; hence I became comfortable in a classroom from an early age, absorbed more information, and was never too timid to raise my hand when I knew the answer. I’m often the only redheaded in my group of friends, so I developed a good sense of direction; since I’m the most easily spotted in a crowd, my pals often followed me when we were out. Here are some other fun facts about redheads in general: Enjoy those baby blues while they last. The world’s rarest hair and eye color combo is red hair and blue eyes. [ Source ]  number 4 on list ] Redheads are more likely to be left-handed. [ Source ] Redheaded babies are the cutest babies. Ok, this one’s just my opinion. READ: Facts About Redheads That May Surprise You I want all this and more for my child. More than I want to dress him in t-shirts that have fun redheaded slogans, I want him to be confident. I want him to know he’s smart. I want him to not be afraid to be kind. Though hair color doesn’t determine these qualities, I know from experience that it helps. Sixteen weeks after birth, what’s the verdict? The jury’s still out. The baby was born with dark hair. Those strands have now mostly fallen out, and it looks like some red is replacing it. Only time will tell. But I still have my fingers crossed. Rock it like a Redhead!

Over the centuries though, DNA has evolved, changed and mutated, so some of us bear little similarities to our ancestors in regard to things like physical features and height.  Even though many people go to great lengths to appear like everybody else, we almost all have something that makes us different from the next person. Usually it's a personality trait, some skill we know, or a talent that not many people have.  Some of us, however, have physical characteristics that make us stand out in a crowd: such as our height, complexion, or the shapes of our faces. Most of these are just a part of our genetic makeup, but some are the direct result of genetic mutations.   This blue eyed mutant is obviously angry about being a mutant! | Source   What Is a Genetic Mutation? Put simply, a genetic mutation is when something in our DNA doesn't quite do what it's supposed to. People generally associate the term with birth defects and, indeed, conditions such as albinism, deformities and even some mental conditions.  Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is our genetic blueprint. It tells our cells what do do as we develop. Genetic mutations are the result of a change or a 'misfire' in our DNA. These genetic mutations are often passed down from parent to child, which is why we often resemble our parents and sometimes inherit diseases like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, certain cancers, asthma and, sometimes, a resistance to specific diseases.  Polymorphisms are genetic changes that occur in more than one percent of the population. These are responsible for hair color, eye color and blood type. These DNA changes do not just occur in humans, but are also responsible for different traits and varieties in other species, such as the black Labrador retriever and their yellow or chocolate cousins.  It is generally accepted in the scientific world that modern homo sapiens first originated in Africa about two-hundred thousand years ago. Without genetic mutations, we would likely all bear the same dark skin, brown hair and brown eyes of our ancestors. The term usually has negative connotations, but some of the results of mutations are not harmful. It's important not to think of a genetic mutation as a defect. It's simply a change in our cellular makeup. So do not fill out your application for Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters just yet.       Painting of Mary Magdalene as a red head by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys. | Source   Red Hair The general consensus is that the first red-headed human appeared in Africa about 50,000 years ago. Soon after, people with fiery hair began migrating to Europe. But how did red hair happen in the first place?  Scientists have declared that red hair is a genetic mutation of sorts that occurs in less than three percent of the entire human population. In some areas, such as Great Britain, red hair occurs in as much as six percent of the population. It is the rarest hair color among humans and is often associated with very fair skin, light colored eyes and freckles.  The genetic culprit is the gene melanocortin 1 receptor , or MC1R. MC1R is located in the cell membrane and is affected by the pituitary gland. The pigment pheomelanin is what gives hair its red color. 50,000 years ago, a genetic anomaly occurred that caused MC1R to release more pheomelanin that normal and, viola, a redhead was born.  Red hair is referred to as a recessive gene. For a recessive trait to be inherited, both parents have to be carrying a copy of the trait in their DNA. Because both parents need to have the recessive gene to pass it on to their children, certain traits often skip at least one generation.  Blond hair is also a genetic mutation believed to have first occurred about 11,000 years ago. The color is thought to be so prevalent in certain areas of the globe, especially Europe, because of sexual selection. Since blond hair was rare and prized, people possessing it were more often chosen as mates.       A woman with Heterochromia Iridium. | Source   Blue Eyes All humans originally had brown eyes, which occurred because of the large amount of pigment that gives color to the eyes. Scientists believe that blue eyes first occurred between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago, and that all people with blue eyes share a single, common ancestor.  The gene OCA2 controls melanin, the pigment that gives us our coloring. Because of the mutation of an adjacent gene, HERC2, OCA2 turned itself off, like a switch, and allowed humans' eyes to turn blue or, rather, disallowed the eyes to be colored by pigment.  Blue eyes were previously thought to be a recessive gene, but that theory has been proven incorrect. If one parent has blue eyes and the other has brown, the resulting children will generally, but not always, have brown eyes as they are the more dominant trait. Also, two brown-eyed parents can produce a child with an eye color other than brown, even if there are no ancestors with blue or green eyes.  OCA2 is also responsible for albinism: when it is completely turned off, people are born with no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair.  Green eyes are actually a form of brown eyes caused by the amount of melanin that is found in the iris, while Amber eyes are a result of extra yellow-colored pigment in the iris and Grey eyes are caused by deposits of collagen in the iris. Hazel eyes are caused by the amount of melanin in the iris and are affected by Rayleigh scattering, which allows the color to shift in certain lights.  Though Elizabeth Taylor's beautiful eyes were considered to be violet and were one of her largest claims to fame, they were actually a shade of blue. Violet, purple and red eyes can only occur with albinism.  A fairly rare eye color condition, heterochromia iridium , allows for each eye to become a different color. This does not only occur in humans, but also in animals. Husky dogs, for example, often have two different colored eyes. This condition, usually caused by a genetic mutation, can also be inherited. The other causes of Heterochromia are disease and injury. A variation of this condition, sectoral heterochromia , causes some to have multiple colors in the same eye.       Are you a mutant?  Yep. I got red hair.  Yes! I have blue eyes!  I'm a red-haired, blue-eyed DOUBLE MUTANT!  Puny wannabe mutants, I can move objects with only my mind! See results   So, Are We Mutants or Just Different? Gingers get picked on, often called carrot tops, and sometimes kids offer to connect the dots of their freckles. There are millions of "dumb blond" jokes too, and some people are creeped out by people with multi-colored eyes. People who have these differences often wish they didn't, while those who don't have them often wish they did.  It is true that some of these physical features are caused by genetic mutations, but, in the end, these are just some of the things that make us different. The world would be a very boring place if we all looked exactly alike. After all, variety is the spice of life.

(also a mutation) not to mention the countless deficiencies...  genetics are crazy! (least i saved a fortune at the dentist!)  ashley 3 years ago  that post by scarede cat was offensive. i resent that implication.  nora 3 years ago  i have blonde hair and blue eyes so does my dad (his turned brown after he married my mom) my sister also does but one of her eyes is half blue and half brown straight down the middle its very weird. then my other sister, my brother, and my mom have red hair and blue eyes. my dad and my redhead sister have husky blue eyes and mine are grey blue and my moms eyes are blue and look hazel sometimes. but please tell me im not the only one who thinks my family has a weird combination?  suzyq 3 years ago  i was born with bright red hair and blue light blue eyes,by the age of 5 my hair was almost white.then in my teens my hair was straberryblone and my eye were very dark blue.now im older and my hair has blonde, red and brown.  Jillian 3 years ago  I find it interesting that you said green eyes come from brown eyes. I was born with very blue eyes, around 11 they turned green like my fathers. I have always assumed it was derived from blue eyes, my brother and father had the same thing happen, but their eyes went from blue to green around the age of 4. My parents where both brunettes. A trait only I enherited. My sister and brother are both red heads. But my sister has brown eyes like our mother. My son is a double mutant red hair and blue eyes, though they have already begun changing to green, just as mine did.  Elizabeth 3 years ago  both my parents have brown hair Dad ( has siblings with red hair ;has blue eyes)  mom (brown hair & hazel eyes). I  have red hair & hazel eyes; my sister blonde & blue eyes. My husband  has brown hair (with red highlights when he has facial hair & hazel eyes). I have red hair and hazel eyes. My son has blonde hair & blue eyes and our daughter has red hair & blue eyes.

But my mom is red headed blue eyes.  mattthe moosey 3 years ago  I have auburn hair, no Color in my skin, and orange (technically amber) eyes. So that makes 3 for me. I also have lactose intolerance, which means that I don't have the common mutation that lets humans eat/drink dairy. So drinking milk is a mutation too guys.  Kept private 4 years ago  from Northeast United States Voted up and interesting :) + awesome :). Very fun hub.  Have a great week  James.H.Slaven 4 years ago  i'm more mutated than that i have flexible bone plating in my fists and chest i also have a second adrenaline gland plus extra sets of teeth which get pointier  and pointier WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!!!  jess 4 years ago  I have dark honey blond hair and blue/green eyes and my eyes can turn a really light clear blue or a darkish green or anywhere in-between  Kay 4 years ago  I have a mutation of the eyes, but I'm the only person I know who has it. My eyes would be a lovely teal color, if it wasn't for the yellow and gold trying to overrule the teal. So my eyes are probably one of the first of a new mutation, plus I only have 1 grandfather with blue eyes. Most people find my eyes creepy :)!  greeneyedblondie 4 years ago  Blue eyes with blonde hair really run in my family but I'm one of those rare green eyed ones! Hence my name.  tabi 4 years ago  Really interesting I have red hair n blue eyes n I never really considered my self as a mutant In science class though we learned that redheads were the first to evolve  Steph 4 years ago  My daughter has beautiful red hair and blue eyes.  I have blue eyes and so does her dad.  Andi 4 years ago  I am a red haired bluish greyish eyed mutant and I love being one and all but it does have its cons I hate bit being able to tan but then I love it cuz what kind of redhead would look good with dark skin the most I can get us a little but darker in the summer after getting burnt of course but in the winter I have a peachy skin color. My eyes also change colors it usually depend in the clothes I am wearing and I wonder why that is. But all together I love being a redheaded child :D well more of an auburn/strawberry blonde also one thing I forgot to mention is that in the summer my hair kind of turns a blonder color.  Daddubear 4 years ago  I´m ginger , I had 3 sisters and ALL of us were ginger , I realize, maybe now, that it ´s pretty weird istn´t it . I ´m tho only who remains alive now  redblue 4 years ago  I have been called ginger so many times that is bassicly what everyone calls me and I'm just fine with it  Jenna 4 years ago  my brother was born with really dark red hair (doctors thought it was blood) he soon after lost his full head of hair and it grew brown but now the weird thing is that when he grows a beard that is the same color of but still only has brown hair, why is that? (he has green eyes)  David 4 years ago  I think I have a real genetic mix. I'm a blue eyed red head whose father and his grandfather had two coloured eyes.   My father was dark but everyone else was red headed. Funny.  James E Cressler 4 years ago  from Orlando, Florida Interesting...I don't believe most of it, but entertaining as well!  Author GH Price 4 years ago  from Texas weluvmike, My hair changes with the seasons, too. I used to dye it redder in the winter because it turns dark but I've gotten too old for all that nonsense!  weluvmike 4 years ago  My hair is seemingly always changing color dependent on the season, really....it's red and  in the summer it's mixed with blonde, like a strawberry-blonde and during the winter it's more brown, like an Auburn; my eyes change dependent on what I'm wearing between bright blue to a sea green mixed with blue  It's really cool, I used to HATE it but now it makes me unique and which girl doesn't want redhead babies!!  corey 4 years ago  Bold red hair and striking blue eyes here, I've never had a problem with it, the burning sun thing kinda sucks though!  Redd 4 years ago  I too am a mutant and proud of it! I have red hair that has never been able to be duplicated in a bottle, believe me my mom tried for over 30 years to find it. But I also have rare mood eyes, also a mutation. When I cry they turn an emerald green, when happy they turn crystal blue, when blah they turn grey. On average they are blue with a steel grey ring.  yup 4 years ago  I have a great nephew who is almost 1year old, he is half white and half Guatemalan he is as white as any other white person. He has the most awesome (sea color) blue eyes. His mom has brown hair/blue eyes and his dad. He babies dad has dark brown hair and brown eyes, it looks like the babies hair is turning color it looks like it is turning red. Why would this be  patsythedog12345 4 years ago  hi have blue eyes  MaHayla 4 years ago  I have Auburn hair and bright blue eyes,but I love them even if I can't tan.  Karin 4 years ago  I would like to ask something and hoping that somebody will be able to answer. If not the author then maybe somebody else who knows. My grandmother had brown eyes, not hazel or anything, like real chocolate brown eyes. They looked almost dark reddish in the sun. My grandfather had blue eyes, just regular middle toned blue. My mother got these really like ocean blue eyes. A really deep, a little bit darker than the most blue eyes I've seen but nevertheless super blue. Her brother got light green eyes. My father had an icy shade of blue, and all family that I know of on his side of the family have blue eyes. Now I myself have the weirdest eye color, they are green. BUT I also have sectoral heterochromia in my left eye. About 35-40% of it is brown. Both my eyes are green, but the eye without the heterochromia are more of a blue/green shade. Or maybe it's just an illusion you get because of the brown in the other one, I don't know. They're not hazel/green anyway, just blue/green. Another strange thing is that my eyes where blue (completely blue, even without the heterochromia) until I was about 5-6 years. The change didn't happen quickly, rather very slow. No one seemed to notice really. Not even myself really, it was more in the early teen years I started to notice and my mother told me that that's just the way I look. But when you look at pictures from when I was about 5-6 years they are a clear blue. Lately my sectoral heterochromia has gotten darker too, more noticable, the last couple of years. Why is this? How come I got this strange eye color when both my parents are blue eyed? Shouldn't I genetically be blue eyed? Blue being recessive and all? I'm also blond btw, in later years it has turned into kind of  a strawberry blond. When I was younger it was more of a light wheat-blond color. I'm 25 now. I'm 100% swedish, if that matters. Could somebody please explain how it works? Because this have really been om my mind lately.  JamieMcQ 4 years ago  Really good info and postings in the comments section.... I am truly a mutant. I am Irish, have very dark brown/black (now going grey) hair, pale freckled skin and I have three colours in my eyes amber, blue and green, both eyes share the same colours. I went to an optician (very lovely she was) she asked me if it was ok for her to take photos of my eyes as she had never seen it before.... I was more hoping for a date.  Lauren 4 years ago  Haha. I have both red hair and blue eyes, it runs in my mother's side of the family. So what if we are 'mutants'? I am in Junior high and almost everybody in my class comments how pretty I am and how beautiful my red hair and or blue eyes are. I'm proud to be who I am and what I look like :) Thank you for this, it was very interesting and somewhat reassuring for people like me out there.  Raven 4 years ago  hello! I really like the info you gave me. It's fascinating! My mom has blue eyes(but in one eye it has specks of green) and has blonde hair and my dad has deep brown eyes and dark brown hair(nearly black) I have blue/grey eyes and dark brown hair (more chocolate than black though) I can't really decide on my eye color because sometimes it's blue and sometimes it's a gray(most of the time grey)How did I end up with this color of gray?  rhiannah 4 years ago  I have red hair and sectoral heterochromia! Having 3/4 green and 1/4 brown in one of my eyes. I'm feeling quite special!!  Amber 4 years ago  Red hair & blue eyes! Whoot whoot mutants (;  Gervaseus Nerik 5 years ago  I have several mutations which include but are not limited to red hair, blue eyes, and RLS. I believe my mutations help define me.  pearca 5 years ago  I have red hair and blue eyes! And I love everything about it and I'm proud of who I am and wouldn't change it for anything.  Shannon 5 years ago  I have red hair and blue eyes.  I prefer to think of us as unique, as opposed to mutant!  angie! 5 years ago  i have a best friend who has red hair and green/blue eyes (she likes to pretend they change depending on the clothes she wears). i've already known about the red hair and blue eyes being mutations, but i had no idea about the origins of the other eye colours! very cool, i'm jealous. (brown eyes, black hair, dark skin, and i still get sunburns!)  emilyarkangel 5 years ago  i have blonde hair and blue eyes, they sometimes turn into a hazel. But my father had blonde hair, then turned black at age 16. mom has brown hair, and so does my grandma. everyone in my family has brown hair and eyes. so i was looked on as an angel in my family. I also love reading these articles, very interesting!  C-C88 5 years ago  So interesting! I am strawberry blonde, I was born with red hair, so my mom thought I'd be a redhead, but by the time I reached 6mths-1yrs old, my hair had turned to white-blonde, with dark eyebrows & eyelashes. Once I hit around 5 or 6, it started to darken, now it is more red in the winter, and more blonde in the summer due to natural highlights. This post provided me with answers to my curiosity as to how I ended up with this hair and eye colour! My dad has blue eyes and almost black hair, and my mom has blondy-brown hair with hazel eyes. My eyes are blue, dark around the edges fading to lighter blue, but around the iris, they are yellow, so they are often mistaken as green as in colour mixing, blue and yellow make green :) I also have a genetic mutation of the eyes, causing me to have 3 rows of eyelashes instead of one, called 'distichiasis'. Elizabeth Taylor also had this condition!  Tiffany Francis 5 years ago  Im fourteen and a red head with blue eyes. I always asked my parents why i have red hair and the didn't.  I never knew it was a recesive gene now I'm proud to be part of only a small portion of people that get the have red hair natturally I'm so lucky. And apparently red hair runs in my family.  Bhavya 5 years ago  Hey Guys... uu all r sooo lucky..... :) Well m not so, I hav black hair n brownish black eyes... :(  But i'll love to marry a girl with blue/green/hazel eyes n brown/red hairs when I grow up.... :)  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Amanda, Well, I'm not a scientist, but I'll try! First of all, most people's eyes do change color. Mine are dark brown but, when I'm happy, they're almost an amber color. Hazel eyes are made up of different colors, so different light settings or even the clothes you wear can make them appear darker, lighter, blue, green or even grey. As for your white hairs, age really means nothing. They're white because, for some reason, they have no pigment. It doesn't mean you're old! I'm 41 and have no grey hair, yet my little brothers both had it in their late twenties. The important thing is that you are unique. And I bet your brown hair and hazel eyes together are very pretty. :)  Amanda 5 years ago  I have Brownish/Hazel eyes :) My great Grandpa had blue eyes. My mother, green when she cries. I've never understood why... My eyes actually change color sometimes. It's odd that they turn green, but it's happened and my friend and I were amazed when we notice it. No idea why but its pretty cool! I would love to have blue eyes. Wouldn't care to be called a freak or whatever, dimples are a mutation, yet people like them. I mean, I myself don't care for them, but some of my friends do. My hair.....is weird. Since I was like 5 I can remember my mom telling me that within my brown hair I had white hairs. Of course back then I didn't care, but now I try to pull out all the white hairs I find (I'm 13) classmates have told me I have white hairs and am old or you know, typical jerks being themselves. :/ It makes me feel weird and unconfortable. I have also been told I have red hairs. Which I am cool with. Can you please do your best to explain the why I have had white hairs since probably birth and why my eyes change color?  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas ssjarkin: You're in good company with Willie Nelson and Frank Sinatra! Thanks for the comment! :)  Shawn Jarvis 5 years ago  from Virginia Very interesting that all of us with blue eyes share a common ancestor. Great hub.  ? 5 years ago  I have curly red hair and blue green eyes but im still beautiful  kat For Scarede Cat 5 years ago  I don't know if you were serious, but I'm still going to answer. First, people get grey hair when they get older. If they're not old, still people can get prematurely grey caused by stress for example. And people have lighter hair on top and darker under because sun lightens the top ones. Secondly, eye color and hair color can change when you get older, don't know why though. Like me, I had dark blue eyes and brownish curly hair when I was little, but now I have a bit lighter blue eyes and truly blonde hair. Maybe it's just that you're not fully developped when you are young, or something like that...  Scarede Cat 5 years ago  I have 2 questions if someone could answer them for my curiosity ?? 1.I have seen some people with kinda grey hairs or dark yellow hairs with green shine . what's the reason for green hairs on humans.  Also have seen humans with multi color hairs on same head (NO DYEING). Dark hairs underneath some light hair on top of head. 2. Do your hair and eye color changes with age. I have seen babies with lighter eyes and hairs but they changed to darker hair and eyes as they grow older.  Scarede Cat 5 years ago  Glad to hear i am the FIRST and ORIGINAL human with black hairs and black eye.  All these blond  are mutant, who came after me as younger humans with masks on their faces lol. I am 200,000 yrs old while these Maskets are just 1/20th of my age. I love Einstein who had black hair s and black Eyes while STUPID Hitler was blond... hahahahaha  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Charlotte, I honestly have no idea! If your eyes are changing color, though, you might want to tell your doctor!  Charlotte 5 years ago  Ok, so I have blue eyes. But a couple of years ago I noticed one of my eyes was or rather is green. And in the the eye that remained blue there was a brown stripe right down the middle of my eye!? Why?  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas RiderJen, My hair is actually getting darker as I get older. In the winter it's almost brown and the red doesn't really come out until I'm in the sun. I kind of want it to go white instead of grey, though! Thank you for the comment! ps. Freaks are awesome! :D  RiderJen 5 years ago  Interesting article, thank you for sharing that redheads aren't the only mutants, haha!

I love interesting facts! :)  Annie 5 years ago  That's really interesting, this is something I now want to look into! Thanks so much :)  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Annie, That's a question I can't answer. I've heard of people with hazel eyes having green and red flecks, but never green. I bet they're beautiful, though. :) Green eyes themselves are brown with extra yellow pigment, so the red flecks could have something to do with that?  Annie 5 years ago  Hi, I was wondering if red eyes would be considered a mutation as well? I have dark brown hair that shines cherry red in the sun, a medium beige complextion, and my eyes are bright green with a lot of gold and red pigment but the red really seems to stand out and I am always complimented for my eyes (someone once aaid they reminded him of christmas! lol) but I have no idea where they come from. My dad has blonde hair and blue eyes and my mom brown hair and hazel eyes. Are red pigmented eyes a mutation as well? Thanks!  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Thank you, Naseem.

Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas J, It sounds like you're working harder to convince yourself than the rest of us. ;)  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas David J Beatty, I would have answered your comment sooner but, for some reason, it came across as spam. Not that I think you're spammy or anything! To answer your question, you will have to look back further than your father and mother. Both of my parents have dark eyes and dark brown hair. I have red hair and brown eyes, my oldest younger brother has brown hair and hazel eyes and my youngest brother has brown hair and brown eyes. I'm very fair skinned and my brothers tan easily. We do look enough alike that, when we're standing side by side, you can tell that we are somehow related. My father's family has tons of redheads, so that's where I'm sure I got it from. The hazel eyes my brother has are also prevalent on my daddy's side of the family. My mother was adopted, so we have no idea what traits her birth family carried. It all comes down to genetics. Or, rather, recessive genes and probability. Somewhere in your family tree are the genes that make you and your brothers and sisters appearances so different.  J 5 years ago  Mutant.... I am no mutant.  David J Beatty. 5 years ago  Hi Georgie, I found this article very interesting. I am a 31 yr old Irish man born 4th eldest to 11 siblings, 12 in total including myself. 6 boys and 6 girls. My father has jet black curly hair and these really piersing bark Hazel like eyes and although he is 100% Irish he has a very dark skin almost meditarain and is only 5'4'' tall . My eldest sister has the same hair and almost as close as you could get with the eye color but very white skin. My mother has brown hair and blue eyes and she's tall at 5'9''. What I have always found strange in my family is that 6 of my brothers and sisters have blond hair and blue eyes and mostly very pale skin but go a nice light golden brown in the sun. The other 5 of us 3 girls 2 boys have brown hair like my mothers and 3 of us with blue eyes and and 2 (each male and female) have green eyes. 6 of us small and 6 tall but all a lot taller then our father.  Half of us seem to have a  very broad and  natural muscle that not one of our cousins uncles etc have. How is it do you think that we all look the same with our owen different features but we all have different mutations. My neices and nephews all have the same blond/brown hair and blue/brown eyes. My question there is how does this work? Look forward to your reply. Thanks.  Author GH Price 5 years ago  from Texas Darby, I'm a mutant too. Red hair.

That's what I have - it never occurred to me that it was rare until I saw it mentioned in an article.  Just curious how many others there are on the BHB.    From: www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/emmakelly/...    4. Red hair and blue eyes is the rarest combination in the world  The majority of natural redheads have brown eyes, with others likely to have hazel or green shades.  But like red hair, blue eye colour is a recessive trait, meaning that both parents must carry the gene for a child to be blessed with it. This makes those with red hair and blue eyes the rarest minority in the world, with only 1% having both.  So, each one is about as rare as a four-leaf clover.

04/22/2014  Yes, DH is very much a redhead. Or at least was. He's turning blonde now he's getting old. Gingers apparently turn blonde rather than white haired when they age.      Lol! He probably got the hair from Dh then. I'd say chances aren't that slim after all, which isn't a bad thing, bean is absolutely gorgeous. But then again I'm no expert. I'm just going off of what I've researched. Before LO  (little one) was born I was dead set that he'd be a redhead since it runs heavy in my family. So I looked up the odds all I got was what I already said about the recessive gene.

No one in my family has red hair. They are all Italian and dark hair or blonde hair. My husbands dads uncle is the only one that had red hair. Everyone else had brown or blonde. None of the other grandkids have red hair except one. It ran on her moms side of the family though. So I figured that's where she got her red hair. Just didn't know what the chances are.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Eye Color  Hair Color  Genetics and Heredity  Eyes  Hair Is it rare to have red hair and blue eyes? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 12 Answers   Alexander Polsky , studied Early Islamic History & Public and International Affairs at Princeton University (1984) Answered Dec 23, 2017 · Author has 926 answers and 224.7k answer views There’s an error in many of the answers here. Respondents observe that “blue eyes are rare and recessive” and “red hair is rare and recessive” — so they therefore infer that the combination must be exceedingly rare. Didja catch the logical error there? The respondents are assuming that these two traits have no correlation either to each other or to anything else; that is that the likelihood that you’ll find someone with traits A and B = (likelihood of A) * (likelihood of B). But that’s not the case at all with red hair and blue eyes. Both traits emerged in the relatively small historical population of Northern Europe, and were spread to a few nearby places. These two traits— nonexistent in most of the world, are thus both quite common in places like Scotland or Ireland, and along the Volga (perhaps brought there by Vikings) and thus the combination of these traits is fairly common there too. Overall, on the planet— both these traits are very rare. You can meet a billion Chinese or Indians and not see one person with red hair or blue eyes, let alone both. But if you’re in Edinburgh, Dublin or Cardiff, not to mention Kensington Palace, you’ll have no trouble finding folks with this combination. It’s a bit like asking “are tall people who speak Serbo-Croatian rare”? On the planet, yes. In Serbia, no. 1k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by Quora User promoted  by 23andMe Explore your DNA with 23andMe.

I have identical twin girls with red hair and blue eyes. How rare are they? Ask New Question Quora User , I fix sentences for a living. Answered Dec 21, 2017 · Author has 52 answers and 38.4k answer views I have red hair and blue eyes, and two of my daughters do as well. From our perspective, it isn’t rare, so I was interested to research this, and to see what the truth is. According to Medical Daily… The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. 5 Surprising Facts About Redheads That Make Them More Rare 16.9k Views · View Upvoters Quora User , Multicareer/degrees,BA to MSN, adj Yale fac, MOM,1981-NOW Answered Dec 27, 2017 · Author has 2.1k answers and 2.4m answer views It’s rare across the span of the entire world population, but there are places you can go where it’s not at all rare. I noticed this first when my daughter attended Fordham U. in NYC. Fordham has long been known as an Irish Catholic Jesuit run school. It attracts some of the best Catholic students in the metro NYC area, especially those interested in going into law, law enforcement, or specific government agencies. From my observations over 4 years of visits to the campus, it appears that at least 25% of the students have red hair, extremely fair skin, and some shade of blue eyes. Red hair is also much more common in Ireland and among the Irish population, along with blue or grey eyes. 525 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Comprehensive Cranium Care® Bald and buzzed heads deserve the best.

Both are recessive trait which means to have blue eyes and red hair colour one must have two copies of the recessive allele (for eye colour and hair colour) to express it.

According to studies, that means I have the rarest hair/eye combination, with less than 1% of the world’s population sharing that combination. I once had a childhood friend who was half Middle-Eastern, half Ashkenazi Jewish (quite the combination!) and had dark red hair, olive skin, and brown eyes. I’ve seen a few of the stereotypically freckled Irish reds, but the few I knew had green eyes, not blue. People would often ask me how I had red hair without freckles, and I responded with, “I’m not an Irish red.” Overall, I consider my red hair as a blessing, and I’m very proud of it. 1.9k Views · View Upvoters Quora User , Emeritus professor of biology Answered Dec 23, 2017 · Author has 5.7k answers and 2.5m answer views I Googled it and saw a number of sites saying red hair and blue eyes are the rarest combination of hair and eye color, and that most redheads have brown eyes, but these were all from popular, unreliable sources like Cosmopolitan magazine. Because it cites its sources, I trust this Wikipedia writer more (emphasis added): “ Red hair (or ginger hair ) occurs naturally in 1–2% of the human population . It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears most commonly in people with two copies of a recessive allele on chromosome 16 which produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. [1] Red hair varies in hues from a deep burgundy or bright copper (reddish-brown or auburn ) through to burnt orange or red-orange and strawberry blond . It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin . It is associated with fair skin color , lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel),  freckles , and sensitivity to ultraviolet light . [2] That writer’s reference 2 is: Valverde P, Healy E, Jackson I, Rees JL, Thody AJ (1995). "Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans" . Nature Genetics . 11 (3): 328–30. doi : 10.1038/ng1195-328 .

Just like for any trait, these features are more more common in some populations than they might be in others. My knowledge is more broad, so an eye colour geneticist may help you better than I can here, however my understanding is that red hair is a consequence of a recessive allele activity, and whilst eye colour is from many alleles working together, I presume there must be a recessive element to that too. Both of these traits are more common from Northern European Populations, and when I read the science - the standard paradigm was that both were adaptations to the reduced sunlight in northern climes - but there were new insights emerging, so that may have been revised by now? So… for the whole species, its fair to say that, yes they are ‘rare’, but some populations both will be very common indeed, including individuals with both of these traits. 366 Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by Quora User   Tony Solange Answered Dec 26, 2017 · Author has 600 answers and 252.1k answer views No. Red hair with blue eyes, and red hair and blue eyes respectively aren't rare because they are neither red nor blue. Both are brown. And, you can't get more not rare than brown, the most common eye color of humans. Consider: The blue eyes are an illusion. Like the blue sky is an illusion. The body doesn't created a blue pigmentation and therefore what you really see is very light brown eyes. The illusion of blue eyes is a result of Tyndall Scattering. [1] Red hair isn't red. See a pattern here? Red hair is really light brown hair. The red hair perception is caused by a gene mutation (the MCR1 or melacortin 1 receptor on chromosome 16). Working properly, MRC1 would produce brown hair.

By Susan Donaldson James  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Susan   March 17, 2014   0 Shares               Email      Star     Courtesy of Brian Braiker Brian Braiker, a banjo player in the band, the "DeLorean Sisters," is often mistaken as Irish because of his red hair.  0 Shares               Email      Redheads, as they say, wear the map of Ireland all over their faces. Sorry, ginger-haired English Prince Harry. And the statistics bear that stereotype out. Ireland has the highest per capita percentage of redheads in the world -- anywhere from 10 to 30 percent, according to Eupedia , a website that explores European genetics and ancestry. They are almost equally prevalent in Scotland and other pockets of Celtic pride. A slightly lower percentage hail from Cornwall in England and western parts of Switzerland. Red hair is associated with the gene MC1R, a recessive and somewhat rare gene that occurs in only about 2 percent of the world's population, according to the National Institutes of Health . That means both parents must carry a copy of the gene to produce a red-haired child and often the trait skips generations. Rarest of all are redheads with blue eyes. The majority have brown eyes or hazel or green shades. Brian Braiker, executive editor of Digiday , who answered an ABCNews.com call for redheads with, "Better red than dead," said he is "always" mistaken for an Irishman. Ethnically, he is nearly all Ashkenazi Jew, except for a maternal grandmother who is Norwegian. Not surprising. Why do you think they called the plundering Scandinavian Erik the Red? Genetic genealogy has revealed a high percentage of people from southwest Norway coincide with a paternal lineage known as haplogroup Rib-L21, including its subclade, Rib-M222, which is typical of northern Ireland. Genealogists speculate that may be because the Vikings took Celtic slaves from Ireland to that part of Norway. Braiker, 6-foot, 3-inches tall, with his brown eyes and full-fledged auburn beard, said he didn't have an easy time of it growing up a redhead. His coloring was nothing like his dark-haired father and light-haired mother. "I endured jokes, 'Are you the milkman's son?' and 'Were you adopted,'" Braiker, 39, told ABCNews.com. The gene apparently skipped a generation or two, as he confides his father's grandfather and a maternal cousin also had red hair. One ancestry company, BritainsDNA , now offers parents the chance to see if they carry the recessive gene by sending in their saliva for testing. If both do, they have a one in four chance of conceiving a redhead. BritainsDNA conducted the biggest study of redhead genetics in the country, with more than 2,300 people who have undergone DNA tests. Redheads like Braiker are more sensitive to hot and cold . And one 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed they need about 20 percent more anesthesia to knock them out for surgery. "I have had dental work and a graft done years ago on the roof of my mouth and it is still sensitive to temperature," he said. "I have also been a life-long wussy." Redheads are also better at making their own vitamin D, which helps protect against osteoporosis, because their bodies are more efficient at soaking up sunlight, according to Yahoo Health . Scottish researcher Jonathan Rees suggests the "ginger gene" may have helped protect redheads from rickets. According to an article in Huffington Post UK , redheads share some other interesting traits: their hair is harder to dye than other shades; they have fewer, but thicker strands of hair' and they go gray more slowly. But there are also health disadvantages. The color of human skin, hair and eyes is dictated by two types of melanin pigment that are produced in the upper layers of the skin: pheomelanin, which is reddish-yellow, and eumelanin, which is brownish-black.    A 2012 study from the journal Nature , found that the pigment pheomelanin, which gives hair the red color, makes redheads more susceptible to the melanoma than fair-skinned blonds, even when they cover up their skin. "What happens in the sun?" asked Braiker. "I stay out of it. The sun is not my friend. I get more freckles and I should wear a ridiculously high SPF on my face." Growing up had its challenges, he said, but eventually there were social advantages to being a redhead. "Over a lifetime, I have developed thick skin," said Braiker. "Growing up I was advanced a year in kindergarten or grade 1," he explained. "So I was a year younger with red hair and a little bit weaker than the rest. I was easy prey." He grew his hair long in college, even sporting a red afro, and continued to get cat calls from strangers: "What's up carrot top?" and "Ronald McDonald." But, he said, it made him tougher. "I always felt a little bit like a freak," said Braiker. "But over time, I learned to embrace the weirdness and it did help shape my personality. ... And there are definitely ladies who like redheads."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.
