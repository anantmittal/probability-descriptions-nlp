               Michigan Classic 47 Lotto Tips  Updated 11/16/17   About Michigan Classic 47 Lotto Game   Michigan Classic 47 6/47 started on May 18, 2005. 
       Classic 47 is a game in which six numbers are drawn from 1 to 47. 
       Drawings are held twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
       Jackpots start at $1 million and increases by $100,000 each drawing that is not won.  The odds of winning the Classic 47 jackpot are one in 10,737,573.
       Compare that to the jackpot odds of one in 30,821,472 of winning Lucky for Life ,
       or one in 292 million of winning the Powerball lottery or one in 302,575,350 of winning the Mega Millions game ! 
       However, there are better games in Michigan to play:
       Odds of one in 2,546,203 of winning Michigan Keno ;
       or odds of only one in 575,757 of winning the Michigan Fantasy5 .    Pick Better Lotto Numbers   Strategy Book  Below are free lotto tips to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful methods of number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  ADD TO CART   Lottery Strategies to Help You Win Michigan Classic 47  Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. But randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Michigan Classic 47 Lotto  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your Classic 47 Lotto numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring less than
       one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two 
       odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of 
       these three patterns will occur in 81 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       47-number game, numbers 1 to 24 would be in the low half, and numbers 25 to 47
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means 
       two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. 
       Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at a list of past winning numbers for Michigan Classic Lotto, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-47, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose six numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 115 and 185. Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Michigan Classic 47 6/47, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the 
       last drawing 81 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Numbers that have been out (losers) for five games or less account for about 
       half of the winning numbers drawn. Losing numbers that have been out 
       ten games or less account for 77 percent of all the winning numbers . This tells 
       us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at 
       least one long shot in your group of 6.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. By playing with a group, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lotto Wheels to help you win   After you choose the best numbers with number strategies, you can improve your odds of winning larger prizes by using lotto wheeling systems.
       It's simple, easy as A-B-C to wheel pick-6 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Six Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheel ® Systems allow you to 
       bet a large group of numbers (more than 6), play scientific combinations of that group 
       of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee . Balanced Wheels ® force all the 
       winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one prize 
       if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. In Michigan Classic Lotto, choose less than 28 numbers to wheel.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in the Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. You can use a FREE  
       interactive Balanced Wheeling System that won
       multiple jackpots. Read about our lottery winners , too. And
       when you win a jackpot with Smart Luck lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's
       growing list of winners. If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor
       that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In Michigan Classic 47,
       with three drawings a week, a set of 6 numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 89,639 years!!! This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS  Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. 
       Smart Luck has all the drawing results for more than 190 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! 
       Even five consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with 
       three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets 
       of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. Michigan Classic 47 has 47 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.
       Advantage Gold is the best lotto strategy software which has a vast assortment of charts and reports

Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page . Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources.  (February 2015)     4-Digits ( abbreviation : 4-D ) is a lottery in Germany , Singapore , and Malaysia . Individuals play by choosing any number from 0000 to 9999. Then, twenty-three winning numbers are drawn each time. If one of the numbers matches the one that the player has bought, a prize is won. A draw is conducted to select these winning numbers. 4-Digits is a fixed-odds game.  Magnum 4D is the 1st legalized 4D Operator licensed by the Malaysian Government to operate 4D. Soon thereafter, other lottery operators followed suit, as this is a very popular game in Singapore and Malaysia. The recently launched Daily Derby 4D Blue and Green and 5D jackpots of WTL-M is also growing popular now. 6063 Singapore Pools is the sole provider of gambling games in Singapore. 4-D and lottery 6/49 are two of the most popular. A similar 4-D game with its prize structure fully revealed can be found in Taiwan . [1]  4-Digits is somewhat similar to " Pick 4 " in the United States , Canada 5-Digits " Pick 5 ", and Jackpot in Germany and Malaysia .     Contents    1  History  2  Methods of play  3  Variances   3.1  Singapore  3.2  Malaysia    4  References  5  External links     History [ edit ]  The 4-D game is believed to have originated in Kedah in 1951, based on evidence during a gambling trial in a Singapore court in 1956. [ citation needed ]  A schoolboy decided to raffle his bicycle for 100 $1 tickets, each bearing two digits. The winner would be the one whose ticket number matched the last two digits of the first prize ticket in a Malaysian Turf Club sweepstake . This led to the 2-D lottery, which in turn gave rise to 3-D and later, 4-D, betting games which were wildly popular in Singapore and Malaysia from the 1950s. [ citation needed ]  The Singapore Turf Club was the first to introduce the 4-D draw in Singapore in May 1966, offering a S$ 2,000 first prize for a $1 ticket. It stopped offering it in May 2004 when its sister company Singapore Pools took over all the draws.  Singapore Pools launched computerised betting for 4-D on 31 May 1986, and it got off to an auspicious start when the winning number for the first prize in the inaugural draw turned out to be 8838. The number "8" sounds like fa ( Chinese : 发 ) or "prosper" in Mandarin and is traditionally a favourite among punters. Punters welcomed the new 4-D product and the company's turnover that year increased 215%, to over S$ 283 million.  Methods of play [ edit ]     A 4-D betting slip in Singapore    Ordinary entry refers to a specific number. Example: 1234. 4-D Roll substitutes any one of the four digits with 'R'. (i.e. R123, 1R23, 12R3 and 123R) where 'R' denotes all digits from 0 to 9. Only one digit can be substituted with 'R'. For example, if you mark R234, you are actually buying 10 Ordinary Entries (i.e. 0234, 1234, 2234, 3234... 9234). System entry is a bet on all the possible permutations of a 4-D number, for example the number 1234 has 24 permutations (1234, 2341, 3412, 4123…). iBet is a System Entry bet priced from $1, regardless of the number of permutations. Quick pick is bet on a random number selected by a computer.  Variances [ edit ]  Singapore [ edit ]  In Singapore , 4-D draws are conducted every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday at 1830h (SG/HK Time) at Singapore Pools' main branch at 210 Middle Road . Anyone above the age of 18 can attend the draws.  An independent external auditor and five draw officials are involved in the draw process. Before the draw, a specially designed computer is run to randomly select the draw machine and the set of draw balls to be used. A backup machine is also chosen.  The selected draw balls, numbered 0 to 9, are weighed to ensure that their individual weights are within an acceptable margin of error. This is to ensure that each ball has practically the same chance of being drawn.  The selected machines, secured under lock and numbered seal in a storage room, is transferred to the draw hall, along with the balls.  The balls are loaded into the draw machine in front of the audience . A member of the audience is then invited to press the start switch on the control panel, launching the draw. The balls in the draw machine, made up of four transparent cylinders, spin until a ball is sucked into a groove found in each cylinder.  The drawing process, starting from the consolation prizes, is repeated until all 23 sets of winning numbers are drawn.  Malaysia [ edit ]  In Malaysia, there are four main 4D providers - Sports Toto , Magnum 4D , Derby Blue and Derby Green and Da Ma Cai . Da Ma Cai is run by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn. Bhd. All 4 are independent private companies accredited and approved by Government of Malaysia. These 4D operators are known as Number Forecast Operators.  Malaysia 4D draws daily and some on every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, which coincide with Singapore's 4D draw. However, sometimes , there will be a special draw on Tuesday.  Magnum 4D offers the classic 4D game - the player picks a 4 digit number and chooses the amount he wants to bet. There are "Big" and "Small" Forecasts. A "Small" bet will warrant higher winnings, but the player will only win if his number comes up in the first, second or third places. The winnings are lower for a "Big" bet, but in addition to the first, second and third places, there are 10 "Special" numbers which pay RM180 for a RM1 bet, and 10 "consolation" numbers which pay RM60 for a RM1 bet. Magnum is the first legalised 4D operator to be awarded the license by the Malaysian Government. In September 2009, Magnum introduced a new game which is an extension of the popular 4D game but with a parimuteul element; this game was copyrighted by Magnum. This game is more popular than the other Lotto games in Malaysia, and This year best number for 1st prize is 8734.  Da Ma Cai (大马彩; literally "Pan-Malaysia Lottery" in Mandarin ) has a 3D game as well as 4D (which they call 1+3D). Unlike the 1+3D, the 3D only has first, second, and third places. Prizes are significantly lower than 1+3D, the top prize being RM660 for Big First Place. Their 1+3D follows the same structure as the Magnum 4D. Da Ma Cai also have 3D and 1+3D Jackpot Games. The latest product introduced from Da Ma Cai is Da Ma Cai Jackpot in January 2014 with a minimum payout of 1.8 million for Jackpot 1. In December 2016 Da Ma Cai provide mobile betting channel "dmcGO" apps (IOS and Android)  Sports Toto, in addition to the basic 4D played the same way as Magnum and Da Ma Cai, runs 5D and 6D games as well. Unlike 4D, 5D and 6D do not have "Big" and "Small" Forecasts. First prize for 6D is RM100,000 and first prize for 5D is RM15,000. If the last 4, 3, or 2 digits of your 5D number (or the last 5, 4, 3, or 2 digits of your 6D number) match the first prize number, you still get a prize. Sports Toto also offers three lottery games, similar to those seen in Western countries. These are Mega Toto 6/52, Power Toto 6/55 & Supreme Toto 6/58. The last number indicates the highest number - Mega Toto 6/52 requires the player to pick 6 numbers from 1 to 52. The Supreme Toto 6/58 has the highest prizes (first prize is a minimum of more than RM8.8 million) but the probability of winning is lower than the others games as there are more numbers.  WTL-M Daily Derby 4D and 5D Jackpots,is almost the same as the above three.It runs 4D and 5D games. 4D's are daily and monthly two 5D's. The prize structure is like One first prize, One second prize, One third prize, Ten Special and Ten consolation prizes.

       explains all of Smart Luck's successful methods of number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  ADD TO CART   Lotto Wheels to Improve your odds   In addition to number selection strategies, you should take advantage of wheeling your lotto numbers to improve your odds.
       You can quickly and easily wheel pick-5 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Five Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lotto strategies to help you win Michigan Fantasy 5   Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. However, randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Michigan Fantasy 5 Lotto  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your lotto numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring less than
       2 percent of the time. The best mix is to have 3/2 or 2/3 which means three odd and
       two even, or two odd and three even. One of these two patterns will occur in
       66 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       39-number game, numbers 1 to 19 would be in the low half, and numbers 20 to 39
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only 2 percent of the time. The best mix is to have 3/2 or 2/3 which means three
       high and two low, or two high and three low. One of these two patterns will occur
       in 66 percent of the drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at a list of past winning numbers for the Lotto game you play, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-8-14-17-32, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose five Michigan Fantasy 5 numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the five numbers adds up to somewhere between 75 and 125. Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Fantasy 5, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the last drawing every
       other drawing or 51 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Numbers that have been out (losers) for four games or less account for about half of
       the winning numbers . Losing numbers that have been out for six games or less
       account for about two-thirds of all the winning numbers . Numbers out ten games or
       less account for 79 percent of the winning numbers . This tells us that hot numbers are
       more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at least one long shot in your
       group of 5.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. By playing with a group, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheeling ® Systems allow you to bet a large group of numbers (more than 5), play scientific combinations of that group of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee .
       Balanced Wheels ® force all the winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one prize if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. For Michigan Fantasy 5, choose less tahn 24 numbers of the 39 total numbers.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. 
       You can use a FREE interactive Balanced Wheel ® System that won multiple jackpots. 
       Read about our lottery winners , too.

       If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In Fantasy 5,
       with seven drawings a week, a set of five numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 1,581 years. This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING FIVE CONSECUTIVE NUMBERS  Even four consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games,
       has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all five numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All five winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25 and 7-14-21-28-35.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers
       with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. Fantasy 5 has 39 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.
       Advantage Gold is the best lotto strategy software which has a vast assortment of charts and reports

Sitemap Terms and Conditions                               Michigan Classic 47 Lotto Tips  Updated 11/16/17   About Michigan Classic 47 Lotto Game   Michigan Classic 47 6/47 started on May 18, 2005. 
       Classic 47 is a game in which six numbers are drawn from 1 to 47. 
       Drawings are held twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
       Jackpots start at $1 million and increases by $100,000 each drawing that is not won.  The odds of winning the Classic 47 jackpot are one in 10,737,573.
       Compare that to the jackpot odds of one in 30,821,472 of winning Lucky for Life ,
       or one in 292 million of winning the Powerball lottery or one in 302,575,350 of winning the Mega Millions game ! 
       However, there are better games in Michigan to play:
       Odds of one in 2,546,203 of winning Michigan Keno ;
       or odds of only one in 575,757 of winning the Michigan Fantasy5 .    Pick Better Lotto Numbers   Strategy Book  Below are free lotto tips to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful methods of number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  ADD TO CART   Lottery Strategies to Help You Win Michigan Classic 47  Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. But randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Michigan Classic 47 Lotto  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your Classic 47 Lotto numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring less than
       one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two 
       odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of 
       these three patterns will occur in 81 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       47-number game, numbers 1 to 24 would be in the low half, and numbers 25 to 47
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means 
       two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. 
       Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at a list of past winning numbers for Michigan Classic Lotto, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-47, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose six numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 115 and 185. Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Michigan Classic 47 6/47, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the 
       last drawing 81 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Numbers that have been out (losers) for five games or less account for about 
       half of the winning numbers drawn. Losing numbers that have been out 
       ten games or less account for 77 percent of all the winning numbers . This tells 
       us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at 
       least one long shot in your group of 6.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. By playing with a group, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lotto Wheels to help you win   After you choose the best numbers with number strategies, you can improve your odds of winning larger prizes by using lotto wheeling systems.
       It's simple, easy as A-B-C to wheel pick-6 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Six Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheel ® Systems allow you to 
       bet a large group of numbers (more than 6), play scientific combinations of that group 
       of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee . Balanced Wheels ® force all the 
       winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one prize 
       if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. In Michigan Classic Lotto, choose less than 28 numbers to wheel.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in

       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In Michigan Classic 47,
       with three drawings a week, a set of 6 numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 89,639 years!!! This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS  Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. 
       Smart Luck has all the drawing results for more than 190 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! 
       Even five consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with 
       three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets 
       of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. Michigan Classic 47 has 47 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.

Initiated under the authority of Public Act 239 in 1972, the games collect funds to support Michigan ’s public school system.

On October 7, 1975, the first instant game ticket was purchased. Terminal-based games commenced on June 6, 1977, when the Daily 3 game was introduced. The first "Michigan Lotto" game was introduced on August 13, 1984. The first The Big Game (now Mega Millions) ticket was sold on August 31, 1996. Since its commencement, the Michigan Lottery has donated more than $20.7 billion to the School Aid Fund .  Lottery Products [ edit ]  The Michigan Lottery offers a number of games in different styles of play, including:   “ Scratch-off ” games;  Terminal-based games, where drawings are held to pick winning numbers. These include Mega Millions , Lotto 47 and Powerball;  Pull-tabs, which are similar to scratch tickets; however, players pull perforated tabs instead of "scratching off" the ticket;  Online versions of scratch-off games, as well as digital tickets for terminal-based games, available for purchase through the internet.   Lottery tickets are offered to the public through more than 10,000 licensed Michigan Lottery retailers, as well as online at the Michigan Lottery's website.  Scratch games [ edit ]  To play Michigan Lottery scratch games, a player scratches off a ticket; each game consists of different themes, play styles and prize structures. The Lottery averages over 70 new scratch games per year. These games are priced from $1 to $30, with prizes up to $4 million.  Terminal-based games [ edit ]  Tickets for these games are sold from lottery terminals connected to a central system. Lottery drawings are held to determine the winning numbers. Depending on the lottery game, drawings are held four minutes apart (Club Keno), twice a day (Daily 3 and Daily 4), daily ( Fantasy 5 and Keno!) or twice a week (Powerball, Mega Millions, and Classic Lotto 47).  Current draw games [ edit ]  In-house draw games [ edit ]  Daily 3 and Daily 4 [ edit ]  Players select either a three- or four-digit number; to win, the player's number must match exactly the number drawn. Optional methods of play allow players to box their numbers; matching the winning number's digits in any order wins a lower payout.  Fantasy 5 + ezMatch [ edit ]  Fantasy 5 began on September 12, 2004, replacing a game called Rolldown . Players select 5 of 39 numbers. Jackpots begin at $100,000 with drawings held daily. Fantasy 5 jackpots increase by a minimum of $5,000 per drawing if there is no top-prize winner. Fantasy 5 results are shown on the nightly version of the Michigan Lottery Show . "ezMatch" is a separate game that can be purchased and played separately from the nightly draw. The game functions as a terminal-based instant game, offering prizes ranging from $2 to $500.  Lotto 47 + ezMatch [ edit ]  Introduced on May 15, 2005, Lotto 47 replaced Winfall . Players pick 6 of 47 numbers. Lotto 47 drawings are held twice weekly with jackpots starting at $1 million. The odds of winning the jackpot are approximately 1 in 11 million. As with Fantasy 5, "ezMatch" is an add-on game to Lotto 47. Prizes offered are identical to those of Fantasy 5's ezmatch.  Unlike Daily 3 & 4 (which draw numbered balls), Keno!, Lotto 47 and Fantasy 5 are drawn using a random number generator (RNG).  In-house Club Games [ edit ]  Added in 2003, Club Games consist of the Club Keno game and pull-tabs , available mostly in social settings, such as bars, restaurants, and bowling centers.  Club Keno [ edit ]  For Club Keno players choose up to 10 numbers out of 80. With results displayed on television sets three minutes apart, the Lottery draws 20 numbers. Wagers are $1 to $20; the top prize is $100,000 for a $1 bet. In 2010, Club Keno was made available to all retailers across the state.  Pull-tabs [ edit ]  With top prizes ranging from $1,000 to $25,000, pull-tab games are similar to “scratch-off” games. Instead of scratching off a ticket, a player pulls perforated tabs.  Keno! [ edit ]  Initiated in 1990, Keno! players select 10 numbers out of 80. During the daily drawings, 22 numbers are chosen. A player matching 10 numbers wins $250,000. Players also win money by matching 9, 8, 7, or 6 numbers. There also is a prize for matching zero numbers, which is a $1 scratch ticket (rather than a free Keno! play). Keno! results are available online shortly after each drawing  Multi-jurisdictional games [ edit ]  Lucky for Life [ edit ]  Main article: Lucky for Life  Lucky for Life is a lottery drawing game available in 23 states and the District Of Columbia. Players select 5 numbers from 1-48 and a sixth number from 1-18. Prizes range from $1 to $1,000 per day, every day, for the winner's life.  Mega Millions [ edit ]  Main article: Mega Millions  On September 6, 1996, six lotteries (including Michigan's) began The Big Game . It became Mega Millions six years later. Players select six numbers from two number pools: 5 numbers from 1 through 70, and the Mega Ball number (1 through 25) for a chance to win a multimillion-dollar jackpot. Currently, Mega Millions jackpots begin at $40 million (annuity value), and increases when there is no top prize winner. Drawings are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. Jackpot winners in Michigan, as with most Mega Millions jurisdictions, choose either the annuity (30 annual payments) or the cash option after winning. The Megaplier option, which multiplies a non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5, became available in Michigan in January 2011.  Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball  Powerball began in 1992; Michigan joined in 2010. Players select six numbers from two pools as in Mega Millions: five numbers 1 through 69, and the red Powerball (1-26). Jackpots begin at $40 million annuity. Drawings are Wednesdays and Saturdays. [1]  Online Gaming [ edit ]  In August 2014, the Michigan Lottery re-launched its website, giving players the opportunity to buy tickets for some draw games and a host of "virtual" scratch-off games over the internet. Over time, the selection of games has evolved to include nearly all draw-based terminal games (the well-known exceptions are Daily 3 & Daily 4), several different versions of instant Keno games, and many different virtual scratch-off games. Prizes for online games range vary depending on the cost of the ticket purchased, but can be as high as $500,000. In order to purchase these online games, a player must be a Michigan resident, as well as physically present in the state when playing.

Wochit Mega Millions will cost more, have longer odds and bigger jackpots starting Saturday. (Photo: Michigan Lottery) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Mega Millions lottery game will cost twice as much and have longer odds but bigger jackpots starting Saturday. The game's starting jackpot will start at $40 million instead of $15 million, according to a Michigan Lottery news release. To win the game’s jackpot, players must match five white balls from 1 to 70 and one Mega Ball number from 1 to 25. The new design of the game is expected to speed up jackpot growth and boost the likelihood of a jackpot reaching $1 billion. The price of a ticket is $2 -- up from the current $1  – and players may purchase tickets for up to 14 consecutive draws. According to lottery officials, the update also will make it easier for players to win the game’s second-tier $1 million prize for matching five white balls. Other secondary prizes also are being increased with the updated game. Players will win $10,000 for matching four white balls and the Mega Ball, an increase of $5,000. Additional prize increases are: •   Players will win $200 for matching three white balls and the Mega Ball, an increase of $150 •   Players will win $10 for matching either three white balls or two white balls and the Mega Ball, an increase of $5 •   Players will win $4 for matching one white ball and the Mega Ball, an increase of $2 •   Players will win $2 for matching the Mega Ball, an increase of $1.

Don’t buy another MI Lottery Instant Game ticket before reading these 5 strategies guaranteed to improve your odds of winning. The Michigan Lottery offers a number of games and ways to play, including online with Instant Online and Keno Online. And yes, you can download a mobile app so you can play from anywhere – just like FreeLotto, except with us you play for free. State-only lottery games you can play are Club Games, Keno, Daily 3 and 4, Fantasy 5, Lotto 47, and Poker Light. You can also take your chances with the multi-state games Mega Millions, Powerball, and Lucky for Life. The Michigan Lottery introduced the Monopoly Millionaires’ Club in 2014 along with 22 other states, but subsequently cancelled it after poor sales. MI Lottery also offers the incredibly popular Instant Games, also called scratchers or scratch offs,  where a player scratches off a ticket to reveal possible instant cash prizes. Each instant game consists of different themes, play styles and prize structures. The Michigan Lottery typically launches about 70 new instant games a year with ticket prices ranging from $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, and up to $30 and jackpots as high as $4 million. Can you win instant cash playing a Michigan Lottery instant game? Absolutely! Just last week Bob Amidon of Ann Arbor won $500,000 playing the Lottery’s Win Big game. Since its launch in July, gamers have won over $5.3 million playing Win Big alone.

The following will show you how you can improve your odds – significantly! Here’s the basic idea: All the MI Lottery draw games – despite what you might read online – are games of pure chance. Sure, there are small things you can do to slightly improve your odds of winning the MI Lottery jackpot. But in general, the only real way to improve your odds is to purchase more tickets. The more lottery tickets you possess, the better your chance of becoming rich. The Michigan Lottery instant scratch-off games, also known as scratchers, are different. Let me repeat. Michigan Lottery drawings are games of chance because the numbers are drawn randomly – without human intervention. Scratch-off tickets are not random because a real person must determine how many total tickets to print, how many will be winning tickets and for what amounts, and how the winning tickets are dispersed geographically. All of these decisions are carefully crafted to maximize excitement and to draw players in and keep them playing. In short, there is a formula to MI Lottery scratch-off games. The challenge is to figure it out. A famous article in Wired Magazine details how Mohan Srivastava, a geological statistician living in Toronto, figured out one of the formulas. “The tickets are clearly mass-produced, which means there must be some computer program that lays down the numbers,” Mr. Srivastava is quoted in Wired. “Of course, it would be really nice if the computer could just spit out random digits. But that’s not possible, since the lottery corporation needs to control the number of winning tickets [otherwise it could go bust]. The game can’t be truly random. Instead, it has to generate the illusion of randomness while actually being carefully determined.” The article goes on to describe his approach. Although his particular method will no longer work on most (probably all) scratch-off tickets, the principle of “illusion of randomness” does still apply. We can’t tell you the exact formula for your favorite MI scratch-off games, but we can offer strategies for dramatically improving your odds for winning money when playing instant cash games. Michigan Lottery Instant Games 5 Best Strategies If you really want to win more when playing the MI Lottery instant lottery scratch-off games, start doing the following: 1. Buy all your Michigan Lottery scratch-off tickets from the same roll at the same time.  You can assume there are at least a few winners in every roll of tickets. Every time you get a losing ticket, you reduce your chances of losing by one ticket. Do not buy different games. If you buy a new ticket from a different roll, the pool of losing tickets is much larger and your chances of getting a winning ticket goes down. 2. Don’t play everyday. Rather buy in bulk. Building on tip #1, the odds are better if instead of buying one ticket every day for a week, you spend the same amount and buy 7 tickets at one time. Better yet, purchase your monthly allotment of scratch offs during one visit. Buying 30 tickets at once is much better than buying one a day. 3. Let others in Michigan buy the losing tickets. If you’re able to and have the time, hang around and watch others play. If you see a prolonged losing streak from a specific roll, your chances of getting a winning ticket increase because scratch-off tickets are sold with a guaranteed number of winners and losers in each pack. You could also make friends with the cashier who could keep track for you. 4. Have the retailer’s computer check your losing tickets. This isn’t about improving your odds necessarily, except that after scratching off 10, 15, or 20 tickets, it’s easy to miss matching symbols or numbers. 5. Strategically plan your play using math and a spreadsheet Most scratch-off games publish on their websites the odds for each instant cash game. Many will often post prizes that have already been won for each game. If you do nothing else, at least be sure to check the appropriate website to see which games still have top prizes available. Now to really improve your odds, let’s do a little math (there’s a spreadsheet at the end to make it easy). We start with a simple concept: When MI Lottery tickets are sold and prizes won, the odds of winning change. For example, if a game has sold many tickets, all or nearly all the top prizes could have already been won, so the odds of you winning that $1 million went from very small to virtually zero to perhaps zero if all the top prizes have been claimed. However, sometimes the odds swing in your favor. Simplifying the math for the example, let’s say 50% of the tickets have been sold but only 25% of the prizes have been claimed. Naturally, your odds of winning have gone up, or swung in your favor, by 50%. This would be a game you should play. In reality, the odds never swing this much. In fact, most of the time, the odds vary only slightly. But a slight move in your direction can help and a few times, you’ll find significant swings that can make a worthwhile difference. We’ve created a spreadsheet you can use to do the math for you. All you need to do is check the game’s website and fill in the numbers. Here’s how the spreadsheet works for a single game: First go to the Michigan Lottery website to find the numbers for the game. You can find the numbers for MI Lottery here:  Page for Michigan Lottery Instant Games Page for Michigan Lottery Instant Game remaining prizes In column A , fill in the available prizes. In column B , fill in the odds, which are usually stated as “1 in X.”  In column C , fill in total available prizes.  Column D automatically calculates the estimated number of tickets sold. The formula is:  Odds X Available Prizes = Printed Tickets  Column E automatically calculates your chances of winning.  In column F , fill in the claimed prizes as published on the MI Lottery website.  Column G automatically calculates the number of remaining prizes.  Column H is an important column. It estimates how many tickets have been sold. This is a number not provided by the website, but it’s critical in determining how the odds have changed.  To generate a reasonable estimate, the spreadsheet uses the estimated tickets sold of the lowest prize amount because this gives us the largest sample size and will be more accurate than the numbers with fewer prizes. You may have to adjust this number depending upon what numbers are available in the earlier columns.  Column I automatically takes the estimated tickets sold and subtracts from total tickets printed to get the estimated remaining tickets.  Column J automatically adjusts the odds based on the new numbers.  Column K automatically adjusts your chances of winning based on the new numbers.  Column L automatically determines how much your chances of winning have changed. Sometimes in your favor, represented by a green bold number, and sometimes against you, represented by a red number.  What does all this mean for the Michigan Lottery Instant Games?  If the odds haven’t changed much, it means that the winning tickets have been evenly distributed throughout the packs, which is not unusual, but it means you can be assured of the following:  Watch for losing streaks from any specific pack. If you see someone else play a number of times in a row and lose, you should play next. A winner will likely follow because of the even distribution strategy.  Bottom line, don’t just walk into a store and purchase a few random MI Lottery tickets, unless you really don’t care and just want to have fun. But if you want to improve your odds, these strategies do help.

Updated on August  8, 2017 at  5:12 PM  Posted on August  8, 2017 at  5:11 PM        Comment       By Matt Durr  mattdurr@mlive.com         LANSING, MI -- Any lottery player knows that the actual odds of winning either the Mega Millions or Powerball jackpots are nearly impossible. That doesn't stop people from trying, because the saying goes 'you can't win if you don't play."  Some of the outrageous things that are more likely to happen to you than to win both the Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots this week. Courtesy of Allstate   But what are the chances that you could win both jackpots by buying just a single ticket for each game? With the Mega Millions jackpot worth an estimated $350 million and the Powerball worth $307 million, many players will be trying their hand at both games.  According to Allstate, you have better odds of sinking a hole-in-one on your birthday, being bitten by a dog while out for a jog and being a victim of identity theft by the time you're 40. In fact the odds of all three of those things happening at 1 in 19.9 million.  The odds of winning both Mega Millions and Powerball?  1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300. That's more than 75 quadrillion for those who don't want to figure that out.  Lottery expert shares tips to win  While you can ever so slightly increase your odds of winning by buying more than one ticket at a time, even if you bought 100 tickets for each game, your odds of winning the jackpot are nearly zero.  If you've heard the odds, but still want in on the action here are a pair of guides on how to play each game this week: A how-to guide for the Mega Millions jackpot drawing How to play and watch the Powerball drawing  The Mega Millions drawing will be held tonight, Aug. 8 around 11 p.m. MLive.com will have live results of the drawing this evening as well.  The Powerball drawing is set for Wednesday night, Aug. 9 at 11 p.m. and live results will also be available for that drawing.

SAGINAW, MI — Planning to win the $344 million Mega Millions jackpot tonight? Two-time lottery winner Joe Palmarchuk says don't bet on it. Palmarchuk, a resident of Barryton, 30 miles northwest of Mount Pleasant, is somewhat of an expert on winning lotteries, having won two separate jackpots of more than $1 million each since 2011.  He doesn't have a good feeling for himself — or anyone else — claiming the big prize tonight, Tuesday, Dec. 10.  "The Mega ball - I don't think it's gonna go tonight," Palmarchuk said. Palmarchuk thinks that what is now the fourth-largest Mega Millions jackpot in history will keep climbing until it is the single largest in history. "I think it'll probably hit the $1 billion mark," he said. It hasn't kept Palmarchuk from trying his luck a third time. For tonight's 11 p.m. drawing, Palmarchuk has purchased 20 easy pick tickets. He said he might grab five more easy picks before the numbers are announced tonight. "You can only chase it so much," Palmarchuk said. "If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen."  If Palmarchuk is correct and no one is left holding a ticket with five correctly chosen numbers for white balls and the single gold Mega ball number, there are still plenty of other prizes available. Related: Michigan man, bankrupt before winning two $1 million jackpots in two years, plans to win again  Anyone who matches just the five white balls will win at least $1 million. If a multiplier was purchased, the ticket is worth $5 million dollars.  Smaller prizes also are available. The odds of winning any dollar amount in a Mega Millions drawing is 1 in 14.7.  "Anybody and everybody has a chance to win it," Palmarchuk said.  That's what led Saginaw County resident Cindy Thiel to buy a Mega Millions ticket, despite the fact that she isn't a big lottery player. "That's the popular draw right now - Mega Millions," said Thiel, owner of First Turn Convenience Store, 2935 S. Graham, in Swan Creek Township.  In March, her store received some lottery-prompted publicity after a Hemlock man won $80,000 in a Fantasy 5 drawing . Since then, Thiel said lottery sales at the store have increased.  "It helps boost the morale around the area, if they think you sold a big ticket," Thiel said.  Thiel said she is happy to see the large number of customers buying Mega Millions tickets, since she hopes to sell another big winner.  "Come out and buy tickets," she said. "We’re looking to sell a big one."  After tonight's big drawing, the spotlight falls on the $122 million Powerball jackpot, with a drawing held Wednesday, Dec. 11. "They’ll play the Mega tonight, then they’ll be back in tomorrow to buy the Powerball," Thiel said.  Palmarchuk said he has already purchased some Powerball tickets at $2 a piece.  "It’s gotten a little more pricey, but your odds are better," he said.                                Joseph and Phillis Palmarchuk talk about their million-dollar jackpot wins  A Michigan man who lives near Mount Pleasant has beaten one in 10 million odds to win $1.35 million in a recent Michigan Lottery Classic Lotto 47 drawing. What makes Joseph Palmarchuk's win even more unbelievable, though, is that it's his second million-dollar lottery win since 2011, the Michigan Lottery reports.     For other who decide to play, Palmarchuk has a few words of advice. “My biggest word of advice is don’t take food of the table to buy a ticket," he said.  Palmarchuk doesn't have that problem, as he plays with money acquired through his two jackpot wins. He has said he sees more wins in his future.  "I’m gonna hit one more mediocre one and then I’m gonna hit a Powerball or Mega Millions," Palmarchuk said. "After that, I'll retire." The reason for the wins?  "I’m just lucky," he said. "That’s all there is to it."  For the latest on Michigan Lottery, check out MLive.com's lottery page for Daily 3, Daily 4, Poker Lotto, Keno, Mega Millions, Powerball winning numbers and more.

                           Enriching the lives of the residents and schools of the Great Lakes State, the Michigan Lottery
is a ticket-based, state-run lottery operation. At state-sanctioned retail locations, the public can purchase instant-win
scratch tickets or tickets for drawings potentially worth millions. About 90% 0f the money collected from these sales is given as prizes or to the State School Aid Fund. Since its inception
in 1973, the Michigan Lottery has contributed nearly $8 billion to schools and awarded about $10 billion in prizes. Michigan collaborates with Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Virginia in a six-state lottery called the Big
Game, now Mega Millions.

The lucky player, who chose to remain anonymous, matched all six Lotto 47 numbers drawn Jan. 17: 01-17-32-33-44-46. She bought her winning ticket at the Quality Dairy store, located at 10850 West M-21 in Fowler. “My husband likes to play Mega Millions and Powerball, but I started playing Lotto 47 about a year ago because the odds of winning are better,” said the player. “It really paid off for me! “I bought my ticket Wednesday afternoon at QD, and then checked it the next morning when I got to work. I was so shaky when I saw I matched all the numbers. I texted my husband to tell him the good news, and he couldn’t believe me. It was all so surreal.” “When we woke up on Friday morning, we still couldn’t believe we’d won,” said the player’s husband. “I looked at her and said: ‘Did you have a dream we won $2 million too?’” The 40-year-old player visited Lottery headquarters Wednesday to claim the jackpot. She chose to receive her prize as a one-time lump sum payment of about $1.3 million, rather than 30 annuity payments for the full amount. With the winnings, the couple plans to create family memories with their children, and then put the remainder into a retirement account. “We are just regular people, so winning this kind of money is overwhelming. We’re so thankful to have this and know that our financial future is secure,” the player said. Copyright 2018 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.

       Classic 47 is a game in which six numbers are drawn from 1 to 47. 
       Drawings are held twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
       Jackpots start at $1 million and increases by $100,000 each drawing that is not won.  The odds of winning the Classic 47 jackpot are one in 10,737,573.
       Compare that to the jackpot odds of one in 30,821,472 of winning Lucky for Life ,
       or one in 292 million of winning the Powerball lottery or one in 302,575,350 of winning the Mega Millions game ! 
       However, there are better games in Michigan to play:
       Odds of one in 2,546,203 of winning Michigan Keno ;
       or odds of only one in 575,757 of winning the Michigan Fantasy5 .    Pick Better Lotto Numbers   Strategy Book  Below are free lotto tips to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful methods of number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  ADD TO CART   Lottery Strategies to Help You Win Michigan Classic 47  Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. But randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Michigan Classic 47 Lotto  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your Classic 47 Lotto numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring less than
       one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two 
       odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of 
       these three patterns will occur in 81 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       47-number game, numbers 1 to 24 would be in the low half, and numbers 25 to 47
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means 
       two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. 
       Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at a list of past winning numbers for Michigan Classic Lotto, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-47, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose six numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 115 and 185. Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Michigan Classic 47 6/47, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the 
       last drawing 81 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Numbers that have been out (losers) for five games or less account for about 
       half of the winning numbers drawn. Losing numbers that have been out 
       ten games or less account for 77 percent of all the winning numbers . This tells 
       us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at 
       least one long shot in your group of 6.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. By playing with a group, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lotto Wheels to help you win   After you choose the best numbers with number strategies, you can improve your odds of winning larger prizes by using lotto wheeling systems.
       It's simple, easy as A-B-C to wheel pick-6 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Six Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheel ® Systems allow you to 
       bet a large group of numbers (more than 6), play scientific combinations of that group 
       of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee . Balanced Wheels ® force all the 
       winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one prize 
       if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. In Michigan Classic Lotto, choose less than 28 numbers to wheel.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in the Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. You can use a FREE  
       interactive Balanced Wheeling System that won
       multiple jackpots. Read about our lottery winners , too. And
       when you win a jackpot with Smart Luck lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's
       growing list of winners. If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor
       that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In Michigan Classic 47,
       with three drawings a week, a set of 6 numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 89,639 years!!! This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS  Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. 
       Smart Luck has all the drawing results for more than 190 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! 
       Even five consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with 
       three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets 
       of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. Michigan Classic 47 has 47 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.

Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page . Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources.  (February 2015)     4-Digits ( abbreviation : 4-D ) is a lottery in Germany , Singapore , and Malaysia . Individuals play by choosing any number from 0000 to 9999. Then, twenty-three winning numbers are drawn each time. If one of the numbers matches the one that the player has bought, a prize is won. A draw is conducted to select these winning numbers. 4-Digits is a fixed-odds game.  Magnum 4D is the 1st legalized 4D Operator licensed by the Malaysian Government to operate 4D. Soon thereafter, other lottery operators followed suit, as this is a very popular game in Singapore and Malaysia. The recently launched Daily Derby 4D Blue and Green and 5D jackpots of WTL-M is also growing popular now. 6063 Singapore Pools is the sole provider of gambling games in Singapore. 4-D and lottery 6/49 are two of the most popular. A similar 4-D game with its prize structure fully revealed can be found in Taiwan . [1]  4-Digits is somewhat similar to " Pick 4 " in the United States , Canada 5-Digits " Pick 5 ", and Jackpot in Germany and Malaysia .     Contents    1  History  2  Methods of play  3  Variances   3.1  Singapore  3.2  Malaysia    4  References  5  External links     History [ edit ]  The 4-D game is believed to have originated in Kedah in 1951, based on evidence during a gambling trial in a Singapore court in 1956. [ citation needed ]  A schoolboy decided to raffle his bicycle for 100 $1 tickets, each bearing two digits. The winner would be the one whose ticket number matched the last two digits of the first prize ticket in a Malaysian Turf Club sweepstake . This led to the 2-D lottery, which in turn gave rise to 3-D and later, 4-D, betting games which were wildly popular in Singapore and Malaysia from the 1950s. [ citation needed ]  The Singapore Turf Club was the first to introduce the 4-D draw in Singapore in May 1966, offering a S$ 2,000 first prize for a $1 ticket. It stopped offering it in May 2004 when its sister company Singapore Pools took over all the draws.  Singapore Pools launched computerised betting for 4-D on 31 May 1986, and it got off to an auspicious start when the winning number for the first prize in the inaugural draw turned out to be 8838. The number "8" sounds like fa ( Chinese : 发 ) or "prosper" in Mandarin and is traditionally a favourite among punters. Punters welcomed the new 4-D product and the company's turnover that year increased 215%, to over S$ 283 million.  Methods of play [ edit ]     A 4-D betting slip in Singapore    Ordinary entry refers to a specific number. Example: 1234. 4-D Roll substitutes any one of the four digits with 'R'. (i.e. R123, 1R23, 12R3 and 123R) where 'R' denotes all digits from 0 to 9. Only one digit can be substituted with 'R'. For example, if you mark R234, you are actually buying 10 Ordinary Entries (i.e. 0234, 1234, 2234, 3234... 9234). System entry is a bet on all the possible permutations of a 4-D number, for example the number 1234 has 24 permutations (1234, 2341, 3412, 4123…). iBet is a System Entry bet priced from $1, regardless of the number of permutations. Quick pick is bet on a random number selected by a computer.  Variances [ edit ]  Singapore [ edit ]  In Singapore , 4-D draws are conducted every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday at 1830h (SG/HK Time) at Singapore Pools' main branch at 210 Middle Road . Anyone above the age of 18 can attend the draws.  An independent external auditor and five draw officials are involved in the draw process. Before the draw, a specially designed computer is run to randomly select the draw machine and the set of draw balls to be used. A backup machine is also chosen.  The selected draw balls, numbered 0 to 9, are weighed to ensure that their individual weights are within an acceptable margin of error. This is to ensure that each ball has practically the same chance of being drawn.  The selected machines, secured under lock and numbered seal in a storage room, is transferred to the draw hall, along with the balls.  The balls are loaded into the draw machine in front of the audience . A member of the audience is then invited to press the start switch on the control panel, launching the draw. The balls in the draw machine, made up of four transparent cylinders, spin until a ball is sucked into a groove found in each cylinder.  The drawing process, starting from the consolation prizes, is repeated until all 23 sets of winning numbers are drawn.  Malaysia [ edit ]  In Malaysia, there are four main 4D providers - Sports Toto , Magnum 4D , Derby Blue and Derby Green and Da Ma Cai . Da Ma Cai is run by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn. Bhd. All 4 are independent private companies accredited and approved by Government of Malaysia. These 4D operators are known as Number Forecast Operators.  Malaysia 4D draws daily and some on every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, which coincide with Singapore's 4D draw. However, sometimes , there will be a special draw on Tuesday.  Magnum 4D offers the classic 4D game - the player picks a 4 digit number and chooses the amount he wants to bet. There are "Big" and "Small" Forecasts. A "Small" bet will warrant higher winnings, but the player will only win if his number comes up in the first, second or third places. The winnings are lower for a "Big" bet, but in addition to the first, second and third places, there are 10 "Special" numbers which pay RM180 for a RM1 bet, and 10 "consolation" numbers which pay RM60 for a RM1 bet. Magnum is the first legalised 4D operator to be awarded the license by the Malaysian Government. In September 2009, Magnum introduced a new game which is an extension of the popular 4D game but with a parimuteul element; this game was copyrighted by Magnum. This game is more popular than the other Lotto games in Malaysia, and This year best number for 1st prize is 8734.  Da Ma Cai (大马彩; literally "Pan-Malaysia Lottery" in Mandarin ) has a 3D game as well as 4D (which they call 1+3D). Unlike the 1+3D, the 3D only has first, second, and third places. Prizes are significantly lower than 1+3D, the top prize being RM660 for Big First Place. Their 1+3D follows the same structure as the Magnum 4D. Da Ma Cai also have 3D and 1+3D Jackpot Games. The latest product introduced from Da Ma Cai is Da Ma Cai Jackpot in January 2014 with a minimum payout of 1.8 million for Jackpot 1. In December 2016 Da Ma Cai provide mobile betting channel "dmcGO" apps (IOS and Android)  Sports Toto, in addition to the basic 4D played the same way as Magnum and Da Ma Cai, runs 5D and 6D games as well. Unlike 4D, 5D and 6D do not have "Big" and "Small" Forecasts. First prize for 6D is RM100,000 and first prize for 5D is RM15,000. If the last 4, 3, or 2 digits of your 5D number (or the last 5, 4, 3, or 2 digits of your 6D number) match the first prize number, you still get a prize. Sports Toto also offers three lottery games, similar to those seen in Western countries. These are Mega Toto 6/52, Power Toto 6/55 & Supreme Toto 6/58. The last number indicates the highest number - Mega Toto 6/52 requires the player to pick 6 numbers from 1 to 52. The Supreme Toto 6/58 has the highest prizes (first prize is a minimum of more than RM8.8 million) but the probability of winning is lower than the others games as there are more numbers.  WTL-M Daily Derby 4D and 5D Jackpots,is almost the same as the above three.It runs 4D and 5D games. 4D's are daily and monthly two 5D's. The prize structure is like One first prize, One second prize, One third prize, Ten Special and Ten consolation prizes.

       The game is now a 5/39 game, in which five numbers are drawn from 1 to 39. 
       The drawings are held daily.
       Jackpots start at $100,000 and increase by at least $5,000 a day until they are won. 
       Payouts are $100 for four numbers; $10 for three numbers; and $1 for two numbers.  The odds of winning the Michigan Fantasy5 jackpot are one in 575,757 .
       Compare that to the jackpot odds of one in 10,737,573 of winning Classic 47 ; or
       one in 2,546,203 of winning Michigan Keno ;
       or one in 30,821,472 of winning Lucky for Life ,
       or one in 292 million of winning the Powerball lottery or one in 302,575,350 of winning the Mega Millions game !   Pick the Right Lotto Numbers with Lottery Strategies   Strategy Book  Below are free lotto tips to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful methods of number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  ADD TO CART   Lotto Wheels to Improve your odds   In addition to number selection strategies, you should take advantage of wheeling your lotto numbers to improve your odds.
       You can quickly and easily wheel pick-5 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Five Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lotto strategies to help you win Michigan Fantasy 5   Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. However, randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Michigan Fantasy 5 Lotto  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your lotto numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring less than
       2 percent of the time. The best mix is to have 3/2 or 2/3 which means three odd and
       two even, or two odd and three even. One of these two patterns will occur in
       66 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       39-number game, numbers 1 to 19 would be in the low half, and numbers 20 to 39
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only 2 percent of the time. The best mix is to have 3/2 or 2/3 which means three
       high and two low, or two high and three low. One of these two patterns will occur
       in 66 percent of the drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at a list of past winning numbers for the Lotto game you play, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-8-14-17-32, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose five Michigan Fantasy 5 numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the five numbers adds up to somewhere between 75 and 125. Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Fantasy 5, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the last drawing every
       other drawing or 51 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Numbers that have been out (losers) for four games or less account for about half of
       the winning numbers . Losing numbers that have been out for six games or less
       account for about two-thirds of all the winning numbers . Numbers out ten games or
       less account for 79 percent of the winning numbers . This tells us that hot numbers are
       more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at least one long shot in your
       group of 5.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. By playing with a group, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheeling ® Systems allow you to bet a large group of numbers (more than 5), play scientific combinations of that group of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee .
       Balanced Wheels ® force all the winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one prize if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. For Michigan Fantasy 5, choose less tahn 24 numbers of the 39 total numbers.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. 
       You can use a FREE interactive Balanced Wheel ® System that won multiple jackpots. 
       Read about our lottery winners , too. 
       And when you win a jackpot with Smart Luck lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's growing list of winners. 
       If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In Fantasy 5,
       with seven drawings a week, a set of five numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 1,581 years. This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING FIVE CONSECUTIVE NUMBERS  Even four consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games,
       has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all five numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All five winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25 and 7-14-21-28-35.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers
       with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. Fantasy 5 has 39 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.
       Advantage Gold is the best lotto strategy software which has a vast assortment of charts and reports

Sitemap Terms and Conditions                               Michigan Classic 47 Lotto Tips  Updated 11/16/17   About Michigan Classic 47 Lotto Game   Michigan Classic 47 6/47 started on May 18, 2005. 
       Classic 47 is a game in which six numbers are drawn from 1 to 47. 
       Drawings are held twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
       Jackpots start at $1 million and increases by $100,000 each drawing that is not won.  The odds of winning the Classic 47 jackpot are one in 10,737,573.
       Compare that to the jackpot odds of one in 30,821,472 of winning Lucky for Life ,
       or one in 292 million of winning the Powerball lottery or one in 302,575,350 of winning the Mega Millions game ! 
       However, there are better games in Michigan to play:
       Odds of one in 2,546,203 of winning Michigan Keno ;
       or odds of only one in 575,757 of winning the Michigan Fantasy5 .    Pick Better Lotto Numbers   Strategy Book  Below are free lotto tips to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful methods of number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  ADD TO CART   Lottery Strategies to Help You Win Michigan Classic 47  Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. But randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Michigan Classic 47 Lotto  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your Classic 47 Lotto numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring less than
       one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two 
       odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of 
       these three patterns will occur in 81 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       47-number game, numbers 1 to 24 would be in the low half, and numbers 25 to 47
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means 
       two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. 
       Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at a list of past winning numbers for Michigan Classic Lotto, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-47, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose six numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 115 and 185. Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Michigan Classic 47 6/47, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the 
       last drawing 81 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Numbers that have been out (losers) for five games or less account for about 
       half of the winning numbers drawn. Losing numbers that have been out 
       ten games or less account for 77 percent of all the winning numbers . This tells 
       us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at 
       least one long shot in your group of 6.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. By playing with a group, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lotto Wheels to help you win   After you choose the best numbers with number strategies, you can improve your odds of winning larger prizes by using lotto wheeling systems.
       It's simple, easy as A-B-C to wheel pick-6 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Six Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheel ® Systems allow you to 
       bet a large group of numbers (more than 6), play scientific combinations of that group 
       of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee . Balanced Wheels ® force all the 
       winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one prize 
       if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. In Michigan Classic Lotto, choose less than 28 numbers to wheel.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in the Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. You can use a FREE  
       interactive Balanced Wheeling System that won
       multiple jackpots. Read about our lottery winners , too. And
       when you win a jackpot with Smart Luck lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's
       growing list of winners. If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor
       that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In Michigan Classic 47,
       with three drawings a week, a set of 6 numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 89,639 years!!! This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS  Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. 
       Smart Luck has all the drawing results for more than 190 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! 
       Even five consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with 
       three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets 
       of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. Michigan Classic 47 has 47 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.
       Advantage Gold is the best lotto strategy software which has a vast assortment of charts and reports

Michigan Lottery   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   The Michigan Lottery offers numerous on-line and scratch-off games, giving players a wide variety of prize possibilities. Initiated under the authority of Public Act 239 in 1972, the games collect funds to support Michigan ’s public school system.

On October 7, 1975, the first instant game ticket was purchased. Terminal-based games commenced on June 6, 1977, when the Daily 3 game was introduced. The first "Michigan Lotto" game was introduced on August 13, 1984. The first The Big Game (now Mega Millions) ticket was sold on August 31, 1996. Since its commencement, the Michigan Lottery has donated more than $20.7 billion to the School Aid Fund .  Lottery Products [ edit ]  The Michigan Lottery offers a number of games in different styles of play, including:   “ Scratch-off ” games;  Terminal-based games, where drawings are held to pick winning numbers. These include Mega Millions , Lotto 47 and Powerball;  Pull-tabs, which are similar to scratch tickets; however, players pull perforated tabs instead of "scratching off" the ticket;  Online versions of scratch-off games, as well as digital tickets for terminal-based games, available for purchase through the internet.   Lottery tickets are offered to the public through more than 10,000 licensed Michigan Lottery retailers, as well as online at the Michigan Lottery's website.  Scratch games [ edit ]  To play Michigan Lottery scratch games, a player scratches off a ticket; each game consists of different themes, play styles and prize structures. The Lottery averages over 70 new scratch games per year. These games are priced from $1 to $30, with prizes up to $4 million.  Terminal-based games [ edit ]  Tickets for these games are sold from lottery terminals connected to a central system. Lottery drawings are held to determine the winning numbers. Depending on the lottery game, drawings are held four minutes apart (Club Keno), twice a day (Daily 3 and Daily 4), daily ( Fantasy 5 and Keno!) or twice a week (Powerball, Mega Millions, and Classic Lotto 47).  Current draw games [ edit ]  In-house draw games [ edit ]  Daily 3 and Daily 4 [ edit ]  Players select either a three- or four-digit number; to win, the player's number must match exactly the number drawn. Optional methods of play allow players to box their numbers; matching the winning number's digits in any order wins a lower payout.  Fantasy 5 + ezMatch [ edit ]  Fantasy 5 began on September 12, 2004, replacing a game called Rolldown . Players select 5 of 39 numbers. Jackpots begin at $100,000 with drawings held daily. Fantasy 5 jackpots increase by a minimum of $5,000 per drawing if there is no top-prize winner. Fantasy 5 results are shown on the nightly version of the Michigan Lottery Show . "ezMatch" is a separate game that can be purchased and played separately from the nightly draw. The game functions as a terminal-based instant game, offering prizes ranging from $2 to $500.  Lotto 47 + ezMatch [ edit ]  Introduced on May 15, 2005, Lotto 47 replaced Winfall . Players pick 6 of 47 numbers. Lotto 47 drawings are held twice weekly with jackpots starting at $1 million. The odds of winning the jackpot are approximately 1 in 11 million. As with Fantasy 5, "ezMatch" is an add-on game to Lotto 47. Prizes offered are identical to those of Fantasy 5's ezmatch.  Unlike Daily 3 & 4 (which draw numbered balls), Keno!, Lotto 47 and Fantasy 5 are drawn using a random number generator (RNG).  In-house Club Games [ edit ]  Added in 2003, Club Games consist of the Club Keno game and pull-tabs , available mostly in social settings, such as bars, restaurants, and bowling centers.  Club Keno [ edit ]  For Club Keno players choose up to 10 numbers out of 80. With results displayed on television sets three minutes apart, the Lottery draws 20 numbers. Wagers are $1 to $20; the top prize is $100,000 for a $1 bet. In 2010, Club Keno was made available to all retailers across the state.  Pull-tabs [ edit ]  With top prizes ranging from $1,000 to $25,000, pull-tab games are similar to “scratch-off” games. Instead of scratching off a ticket, a player pulls perforated tabs.  Keno! [ edit ]  Initiated in 1990, Keno! players select 10 numbers out of 80. During the daily drawings, 22 numbers are chosen. A player matching 10 numbers wins $250,000. Players also win money by matching 9, 8, 7, or 6 numbers. There also is a prize for matching zero numbers, which is a $1 scratch ticket (rather than a free Keno! play). Keno! results are available online shortly after each drawing  Multi-jurisdictional games [ edit ]  Lucky for Life [ edit ]  Main article: Lucky for Life  Lucky for Life is a lottery drawing game available in 23 states and the District Of Columbia. Players select 5 numbers from 1-48 and a sixth number from 1-18. Prizes range from $1 to $1,000 per day, every day, for the winner's life.  Mega Millions [ edit ]  Main article: Mega Millions  On September 6, 1996, six lotteries (including Michigan's) began The Big Game . It became Mega Millions six years later. Players select six numbers from two number pools: 5 numbers from 1 through 70, and the Mega Ball number (1 through 25) for a chance to win a multimillion-dollar jackpot. Currently, Mega Millions jackpots begin at $40 million (annuity value), and increases when there is no top prize winner. Drawings are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. Jackpot winners in Michigan, as with most Mega Millions jurisdictions, choose either the annuity (30 annual payments) or the cash option after winning. The Megaplier option, which multiplies a non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5, became available in Michigan in January 2011.  Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball  Powerball began in 1992; Michigan joined in 2010. Players select six numbers from two pools as in Mega Millions: five numbers 1 through 69, and the red Powerball (1-26). Jackpots begin at $40 million annuity. Drawings are Wednesdays and Saturdays. [1]  Online Gaming [ edit ]  In August 2014, the Michigan Lottery re-launched its website, giving players the opportunity to buy tickets for some draw games and a host of "virtual" scratch-off games over the internet. Over time, the selection of games has evolved to include nearly all draw-based terminal games (the well-known exceptions are Daily 3 & Daily 4), several different versions of instant Keno games, and many different virtual scratch-off games. Prizes for online games range vary depending on the cost of the ticket purchased, but can be as high as $500,000. In order to purchase these online games, a player must be a Michigan resident, as well as physically present in the state when playing.

The first "Michigan Lotto" game was introduced on August 13, 1984. The first The Big Game (now Mega Millions) ticket was sold on August 31, 1996. Since its commencement, the Michigan Lottery has donated more than $20.7 billion to the School Aid Fund .  Lottery Products [ edit ]  The Michigan Lottery offers a number of games in different styles of play, including:   “ Scratch-off ” games;  Terminal-based games, where drawings are held to pick winning numbers. These include Mega Millions , Lotto 47 and Powerball;  Pull-tabs, which are similar to scratch tickets; however, players pull perforated tabs instead of "scratching off" the ticket;  Online versions of scratch-off games, as well as digital tickets for terminal-based games, available for purchase through the internet.   Lottery tickets are offered to the public through more than 10,000 licensed Michigan Lottery retailers, as well as online at the Michigan Lottery's website.  Scratch games [ edit ]  To play Michigan Lottery scratch games, a player scratches off a ticket; each game consists of different themes, play styles and prize structures. The Lottery averages over 70 new scratch games per year. These games are priced from $1 to $30, with prizes up to $4 million.  Terminal-based games [ edit ]  Tickets for these games are sold from lottery terminals connected to a central system. Lottery drawings are held to determine the winning numbers. Depending on the lottery game, drawings are held four minutes apart (Club Keno), twice a day (Daily 3 and Daily 4), daily ( Fantasy 5 and Keno!) or twice a week (Powerball, Mega Millions, and Classic Lotto 47).  Current draw games [ edit ]  In-house draw games [ edit ]  Daily 3 and Daily 4 [ edit ]  Players select either a three- or four-digit number; to win, the player's number must match exactly the number drawn. Optional methods of play allow players to box their numbers; matching the winning number's digits in any order wins a lower payout.  Fantasy 5 + ezMatch [ edit ]  Fantasy 5 began on September 12, 2004, replacing a game called Rolldown . Players select 5 of 39 numbers. Jackpots begin at $100,000 with drawings held daily. Fantasy 5 jackpots increase by a minimum of $5,000 per drawing if there is no top-prize winner. Fantasy 5 results are shown on the nightly version of the Michigan Lottery Show . "ezMatch" is a separate game that can be purchased and played separately from the nightly draw. The game functions as a terminal-based instant game, offering prizes ranging from $2 to $500.  Lotto 47 + ezMatch [ edit ]  Introduced on May 15, 2005, Lotto 47 replaced Winfall . Players pick 6 of 47 numbers. Lotto 47 drawings are held twice weekly with jackpots starting at $1 million. The odds of winning the jackpot are approximately 1 in 11 million. As with Fantasy 5, "ezMatch" is an add-on game to Lotto 47. Prizes offered are identical to those of Fantasy 5's ezmatch.  Unlike Daily 3 & 4 (which draw numbered balls), Keno!, Lotto 47 and Fantasy 5 are drawn using a random number generator (RNG).  In-house Club Games [ edit ]  Added in 2003, Club Games consist of the Club Keno game and pull-tabs , available mostly in social settings, such as bars, restaurants, and bowling centers.  Club Keno [ edit ]  For Club Keno players choose up to 10 numbers out of 80. With results displayed on television sets three minutes apart, the Lottery draws 20 numbers. Wagers are $1 to $20; the top prize is $100,000 for a $1 bet. In 2010, Club Keno was made available to all retailers across the state.  Pull-tabs [ edit ]  With top prizes ranging from $1,000 to $25,000, pull-tab games are similar to “scratch-off” games. Instead of scratching off a ticket, a player pulls perforated tabs.  Keno! [ edit ]  Initiated in 1990, Keno! players select 10 numbers out of 80. During the daily drawings, 22 numbers are chosen. A player matching 10 numbers wins $250,000. Players also win money by matching 9, 8, 7, or 6 numbers. There also is a prize for matching zero numbers, which is a $1 scratch ticket (rather than a free Keno! play). Keno! results are available online shortly after each drawing  Multi-jurisdictional games [ edit ]  Lucky for Life [ edit ]  Main article: Lucky for Life  Lucky for Life is a lottery drawing game available in 23 states and the District Of Columbia. Players select 5 numbers from 1-48 and a sixth number from 1-18. Prizes range from $1 to $1,000 per day, every day, for the winner's life.  Mega Millions [ edit ]  Main article: Mega Millions  On September 6, 1996, six lotteries (including Michigan's) began The Big Game . It became Mega Millions six years later. Players select six numbers from two number pools: 5 numbers from 1 through 70, and the Mega Ball number (1 through 25) for a chance to win a multimillion-dollar jackpot. Currently, Mega Millions jackpots begin at $40 million (annuity value), and increases when there is no top prize winner. Drawings are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. Jackpot winners in Michigan, as with most Mega Millions jurisdictions, choose either the annuity (30 annual payments) or the cash option after winning. The Megaplier option, which multiplies a non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5, became available in Michigan in January 2011.  Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball  Powerball began in 1992; Michigan joined in 2010. Players select six numbers from two pools as in Mega Millions: five numbers 1 through 69, and the red Powerball (1-26). Jackpots begin at $40 million annuity. Drawings are Wednesdays and Saturdays. [1]  Online Gaming [ edit ]  In August 2014, the Michigan Lottery re-launched its website, giving players the opportunity to buy tickets for some draw games and a host of "virtual" scratch-off games over the internet. Over time, the selection of games has evolved to include nearly all draw-based terminal games (the well-known exceptions are Daily 3 & Daily 4), several different versions of instant Keno games, and many different virtual scratch-off games. Prizes for online games range vary depending on the cost of the ticket purchased, but can be as high as $500,000. In order to purchase these online games, a player must be a Michigan resident, as well as physically present in the state when playing.

(Photo: Michigan Lottery) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Mega Millions lottery game will cost twice as much and have longer odds but bigger jackpots starting Saturday. The game's starting jackpot will start at $40 million instead of $15 million, according to a Michigan Lottery news release. To win the game’s jackpot, players must match five white balls from 1 to 70 and one Mega Ball number from 1 to 25. The new design of the game is expected to speed up jackpot growth and boost the likelihood of a jackpot reaching $1 billion. The price of a ticket is $2 -- up from the current $1  – and players may purchase tickets for up to 14 consecutive draws. According to lottery officials, the update also will make it easier for players to win the game’s second-tier $1 million prize for matching five white balls. Other secondary prizes also are being increased with the updated game. Players will win $10,000 for matching four white balls and the Mega Ball, an increase of $5,000. Additional prize increases are: •   Players will win $200 for matching three white balls and the Mega Ball, an increase of $150 •   Players will win $10 for matching either three white balls or two white balls and the Mega Ball, an increase of $5 •   Players will win $4 for matching one white ball and the Mega Ball, an increase of $2 •   Players will win $2 for matching the Mega Ball, an increase of $1.

Don’t buy another MI Lottery Instant Game ticket before reading these 5 strategies guaranteed to improve your odds of winning. The Michigan Lottery offers a number of games and ways to play, including online with Instant Online and Keno Online. And yes, you can download a mobile app so you can play from anywhere – just like FreeLotto, except with us you play for free. State-only lottery games you can play are Club Games, Keno, Daily 3 and 4, Fantasy 5, Lotto 47, and Poker Light.

The Michigan Lottery introduced the Monopoly Millionaires’ Club in 2014 along with 22 other states, but subsequently cancelled it after poor sales. MI Lottery also offers the incredibly popular Instant Games, also called scratchers or scratch offs,  where a player scratches off a ticket to reveal possible instant cash prizes. Each instant game consists of different themes, play styles and prize structures. The Michigan Lottery typically launches about 70 new instant games a year with ticket prices ranging from $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, and up to $30 and jackpots as high as $4 million. Can you win instant cash playing a Michigan Lottery instant game? Absolutely! Just last week Bob Amidon of Ann Arbor won $500,000 playing the Lottery’s Win Big game. Since its launch in July, gamers have won over $5.3 million playing Win Big alone.

The following will show you how you can improve your odds – significantly! Here’s the basic idea: All the MI Lottery draw games – despite what you might read online – are games of pure chance. Sure, there are small things you can do to slightly improve your odds of winning the MI Lottery jackpot. But in general, the only real way to improve your odds is to purchase more tickets. The more lottery tickets you possess, the better your chance of becoming rich. The Michigan Lottery instant scratch-off games, also known as scratchers, are different. Let me repeat. Michigan Lottery drawings are games of chance because the numbers are drawn randomly – without human intervention. Scratch-off tickets are not random because a real person must determine how many total tickets to print, how many will be winning tickets and for what amounts, and how the winning tickets are dispersed geographically. All of these decisions are carefully crafted to maximize excitement and to draw players in and keep them playing. In short, there is a formula to MI Lottery scratch-off games. The challenge is to figure it out. A famous article in Wired Magazine details how Mohan Srivastava, a geological statistician living in Toronto, figured out one of the formulas. “The tickets are clearly mass-produced, which means there must be some computer program that lays down the numbers,” Mr. Srivastava is quoted in Wired. “Of course, it would be really nice if the computer could just spit out random digits. But that’s not possible, since the lottery corporation needs to control the number of winning tickets [otherwise it could go bust]. The game can’t be truly random. Instead, it has to generate the illusion of randomness while actually being carefully determined.” The article goes on to describe his approach. Although his particular method will no longer work on most (probably all) scratch-off tickets, the principle of “illusion of randomness” does still apply. We can’t tell you the exact formula for your favorite MI scratch-off games, but we can offer strategies for dramatically improving your odds for winning money when playing instant cash games. Michigan Lottery Instant Games 5 Best Strategies If you really want to win more when playing the MI Lottery instant lottery scratch-off games, start doing the following: 1. Buy all your Michigan Lottery scratch-off tickets from the same roll at the same time.  You can assume there are at least a few winners in every roll of tickets. Every time you get a losing ticket, you reduce your chances of losing by one ticket. Do not buy different games. If you buy a new ticket from a different roll, the pool of losing tickets is much larger and your chances of getting a winning ticket goes down. 2. Don’t play everyday. Rather buy in bulk. Building on tip #1, the odds are better if instead of buying one ticket every day for a week, you spend the same amount and buy 7 tickets at one time. Better yet, purchase your monthly allotment of scratch offs during one visit. Buying 30 tickets at once is much better than buying one a day. 3. Let others in Michigan buy the losing tickets. If you’re able to and have the time, hang around and watch others play. If you see a prolonged losing streak from a specific roll, your chances of getting a winning ticket increase because scratch-off tickets are sold with a guaranteed number of winners and losers in each pack. You could also make friends with the cashier who could keep track for you. 4. Have the retailer’s computer check your losing tickets. This isn’t about improving your odds necessarily, except that after scratching off 10, 15, or 20 tickets, it’s easy to miss matching symbols or numbers. 5. Strategically plan your play using math and a spreadsheet Most scratch-off games publish on their websites the odds for each instant cash game. Many will often post prizes that have already been won for each game. If you do nothing else, at least be sure to check the appropriate website to see which games still have top prizes available. Now to really improve your odds, let’s do a little math (there’s a spreadsheet at the end to make it easy). We start with a simple concept: When MI Lottery tickets are sold and prizes won, the odds of winning change. For example, if a game has sold many tickets, all or nearly all the top prizes could have already been won, so the odds of you winning that $1 million went from very small to virtually zero to perhaps zero if all the top prizes have been claimed. However, sometimes the odds swing in your favor. Simplifying the math for the example, let’s say 50% of the tickets have been sold but only 25% of the prizes have been claimed. Naturally, your odds of winning have gone up, or swung in your favor, by 50%. This would be a game you should play. In reality, the odds never swing this much. In fact, most of the time, the odds vary only slightly. But a slight move in your direction can help and a few times, you’ll find significant swings that can make a worthwhile difference. We’ve created a spreadsheet you can use to do the math for you. All you need to do is check the game’s website and fill in the numbers. Here’s how the spreadsheet works for a single game: First go to the Michigan Lottery website to find the numbers for the game. You can find the numbers for MI Lottery here:  Page for Michigan Lottery Instant Games Page for Michigan Lottery Instant Game remaining prizes In column A , fill in the available prizes. In column B , fill in the odds, which are usually stated as “1 in X.”  In column C , fill in total available prizes.  Column D automatically calculates the estimated number of tickets sold. The formula is:  Odds X Available Prizes = Printed Tickets  Column E automatically calculates your chances of winning.  In column F , fill in the claimed prizes as published on the MI Lottery website.  Column G automatically calculates the number of remaining prizes.  Column H is an important column. It estimates how many tickets have been sold. This is a number not provided by the website, but it’s critical in determining how the odds have changed.  To generate a reasonable estimate, the spreadsheet uses the estimated tickets sold of the lowest prize amount because this gives us the largest sample size and will be more accurate than the numbers with fewer prizes. You may have to adjust this number depending upon what numbers are available in the earlier columns.  Column I automatically takes the estimated tickets sold and subtracts from total tickets printed to get the estimated remaining tickets.  Column J automatically adjusts the odds based on the new numbers.  Column K automatically adjusts your chances of winning based on the new numbers.  Column L automatically determines how much your chances of winning have changed. Sometimes in your favor, represented by a green bold number, and sometimes against you, represented by a red number.  What does all this mean for the Michigan Lottery Instant Games?  If the odds haven’t changed much, it means that the winning tickets have been evenly distributed throughout the packs, which is not unusual, but it means you can be assured of the following:  Watch for losing streaks from any specific pack. If you see someone else play a number of times in a row and lose, you should play next. A winner will likely follow because of the even distribution strategy.  Bottom line, don’t just walk into a store and purchase a few random MI Lottery tickets, unless you really don’t care and just want to have fun. But if you want to improve your odds, these strategies do help.

Updated on August  8, 2017 at  5:12 PM  Posted on August  8, 2017 at  5:11 PM        Comment       By Matt Durr  mattdurr@mlive.com         LANSING, MI -- Any lottery player knows that the actual odds of winning either the Mega Millions or Powerball jackpots are nearly impossible. That doesn't stop people from trying, because the saying goes 'you can't win if you don't play."  Some of the outrageous things that are more likely to happen to you than to win both the Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots this week. Courtesy of Allstate   But what are the chances that you could win both jackpots by buying just a single ticket for each game? With the Mega Millions jackpot worth an estimated $350 million and the Powerball worth $307 million, many players will be trying their hand at both games.  According to Allstate, you have better odds of sinking a hole-in-one on your birthday, being bitten by a dog while out for a jog and being a victim of identity theft by the time you're 40. In fact the odds of all three of those things happening at 1 in 19.9 million.  The odds of winning both Mega Millions and Powerball?  1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300. That's more than 75 quadrillion for those who don't want to figure that out.  Lottery expert shares tips to win  While you can ever so slightly increase your odds of winning by buying more than one ticket at a time, even if you bought 100 tickets for each game, your odds of winning the jackpot are nearly zero.  If you've heard the odds, but still want in on the action here are a pair of guides on how to play each game this week: A how-to guide for the Mega Millions jackpot drawing How to play and watch the Powerball drawing  The Mega Millions drawing will be held tonight, Aug. 8 around 11 p.m. MLive.com will have live results of the drawing this evening as well.  The Powerball drawing is set for Wednesday night, Aug. 9 at 11 p.m. and live results will also be available for that drawing.

SAGINAW, MI — Planning to win the $344 million Mega Millions jackpot tonight? Two-time lottery winner Joe Palmarchuk says don't bet on it. Palmarchuk, a resident of Barryton, 30 miles northwest of Mount Pleasant, is somewhat of an expert on winning lotteries, having won two separate jackpots of more than $1 million each since 2011.  He doesn't have a good feeling for himself — or anyone else — claiming the big prize tonight, Tuesday, Dec. 10.  "The Mega ball - I don't think it's gonna go tonight," Palmarchuk said. Palmarchuk thinks that what is now the fourth-largest Mega Millions jackpot in history will keep climbing until it is the single largest in history. "I think it'll probably hit the $1 billion mark," he said. It hasn't kept Palmarchuk from trying his luck a third time. For tonight's 11 p.m. drawing, Palmarchuk has purchased 20 easy pick tickets. He said he might grab five more easy picks before the numbers are announced tonight. "You can only chase it so much," Palmarchuk said. "If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen."  If Palmarchuk is correct and no one is left holding a ticket with five correctly chosen numbers for white balls and the single gold Mega ball number, there are still plenty of other prizes available. Related: Michigan man, bankrupt before winning two $1 million jackpots in two years, plans to win again  Anyone who matches just the five white balls will win at least $1 million. If a multiplier was purchased, the ticket is worth $5 million dollars.  Smaller prizes also are available. The odds of winning any dollar amount in a Mega Millions drawing is 1 in 14.7.  "Anybody and everybody has a chance to win it," Palmarchuk said.  That's what led Saginaw County resident Cindy Thiel to buy a Mega Millions ticket, despite the fact that she isn't a big lottery player. "That's the popular draw right now - Mega Millions," said Thiel, owner of First Turn Convenience Store, 2935 S. Graham, in Swan Creek Township.  In March, her store received some lottery-prompted publicity after a Hemlock man won $80,000 in a Fantasy 5 drawing . Since then, Thiel said lottery sales at the store have increased.  "It helps boost the morale around the area, if they think you sold a big ticket," Thiel said.  Thiel said she is happy to see the large number of customers buying Mega Millions tickets, since she hopes to sell another big winner.  "Come out and buy tickets," she said. "We’re looking to sell a big one."  After tonight's big drawing, the spotlight falls on the $122 million Powerball jackpot, with a drawing held Wednesday, Dec. 11. "They’ll play the Mega tonight, then they’ll be back in tomorrow to buy the Powerball," Thiel said.  Palmarchuk said he has already purchased some Powerball tickets at $2 a piece.  "It’s gotten a little more pricey, but your odds are better," he said.                                Joseph and Phillis Palmarchuk talk about their million-dollar jackpot wins  A Michigan man who lives near Mount Pleasant has beaten one in 10 million odds to win $1.35 million in a recent Michigan Lottery Classic Lotto 47 drawing. What makes Joseph Palmarchuk's win even more unbelievable, though, is that it's his second million-dollar lottery win since 2011, the Michigan Lottery reports.     For other who decide to play, Palmarchuk has a few words of advice. “My biggest word of advice is don’t take food of the table to buy a ticket," he said.  Palmarchuk doesn't have that problem, as he plays with money acquired through his two jackpot wins. He has said he sees more wins in his future.  "I’m gonna hit one more mediocre one and then I’m gonna hit a Powerball or Mega Millions," Palmarchuk said. "After that, I'll retire." The reason for the wins?  "I’m just lucky," he said. "That’s all there is to it."  For the latest on Michigan Lottery, check out MLive.com's lottery page for Daily 3, Daily 4, Poker Lotto, Keno, Mega Millions, Powerball winning numbers and more.

                           Enriching the lives of the residents and schools of the Great Lakes State, the Michigan Lottery
is a ticket-based, state-run lottery operation. At state-sanctioned retail locations, the public can purchase instant-win
scratch tickets or tickets for drawings potentially worth millions. About 90% 0f the money collected from these sales is given as prizes or to the State School Aid Fund. Since its inception
in 1973, the Michigan Lottery has contributed nearly $8 billion to schools and awarded about $10 billion in prizes. Michigan collaborates with Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Virginia in a six-state lottery called the Big
Game, now Mega Millions.

The lucky player, who chose to remain anonymous, matched all six Lotto 47 numbers drawn Jan. 17: 01-17-32-33-44-46. She bought her winning ticket at the Quality Dairy store, located at 10850 West M-21 in Fowler. “My husband likes to play Mega Millions and Powerball, but I started playing Lotto 47 about a year ago because the odds of winning are better,” said the player. “It really paid off for me! “I bought my ticket Wednesday afternoon at QD, and then checked it the next morning when I got to work. I was so shaky when I saw I matched all the numbers. I texted my husband to tell him the good news, and he couldn’t believe me. It was all so surreal.” “When we woke up on Friday morning, we still couldn’t believe we’d won,” said the player’s husband. “I looked at her and said: ‘Did you have a dream we won $2 million too?’” The 40-year-old player visited Lottery headquarters Wednesday to claim the jackpot. She chose to receive her prize as a one-time lump sum payment of about $1.3 million, rather than 30 annuity payments for the full amount. With the winnings, the couple plans to create family memories with their children, and then put the remainder into a retirement account. “We are just regular people, so winning this kind of money is overwhelming. We’re so thankful to have this and know that our financial future is secure,” the player said. Copyright 2018 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.
