Both men and women are at risk for celiac disease. People of any age or race can develop this genetic autoimmune condition. However, there are some factors that can increase your risk of developing celiac disease.  Having a Biological Relative with Celiac Disease  Celiac disease is genetically based, so it is more common in those with a family history of the condition. This means that if you have a blood relative with celiac disease, you are at an increased risk for developing it, too. This autoimmune condition occurs in up to 5-10% of family members of people diagnosed with celiac disease.  Learn more about Celiac Disease in Families »  HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 Genes  About 95% of people with celiac disease have the HLA-DQ2 gene and most of the remaining 5% have the HLA-DQ8 gene. Genetic testing can determine if you have one or both of these genes.  It is important to note that having the gene means you are at-risk for developing celiac disease, it but does not mean that you definitely have the disease. A positive genetic test should be followed up with a celiac disease blood panel to determine if you have celiac disease. If your genetic test returns with a negative result, you can virtually rule out celiac disease.  Some Autoimmune Diseases  Having an autoimmune disease makes you more likely to develop other autoimmune diseases, like celiac disease. Thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes are examples of other autoimmune diseases.       OUR SPONSORS & PARTNERS  Advertise with us                   DO YOU THINK YOU MAY HAVE CELIAC DISEASE?

What causes this disease?  Answer:  Celiac disease is a digestive disorder triggered by gluten, a protein found in foods that contain wheat, barley or rye. When people who have celiac disease eat gluten, the result is a reaction in their small intestine that can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating and weight loss. Early diagnosis of celiac disease is important because if left untreated the disorder can result in serious complications.  Celiac disease is an immune disorder. The immune system mistakenly targets 'friends,' like foods or even healthy organs and tissue. When a person has celiac disease, the body's immune system overreacts in response to gluten, damaging the small intestine and reducing its ability to absorb nutrients.  The underlying cause of celiac disease appears to be based, in part, on a person's genetic makeup. Research has found that celiac disease tends to run in families, and some gene types increase a person's risk for developing the disease. There's more involved than just genetics, though. Most people who have the gene types that put them at risk for celiac disease never develop the disorder, while others begin having symptoms early in life, and still others are not affected until their 60s or older.  Conditions that put a person's immune system on high alert may activate the disease. For example, some research suggests that certain infections, particularly gastroenteritis, could spark the immune system response associated with celiac disease. The disease is more common in children delivered by cesarean section. Pregnancy also may play a role. Some women develop the disease several months after giving birth.  When celiac disease begins, the most common symptoms are diarrhea, abdominal pain or bloating, especially after meals. People with celiac disease may lose weight because their bodies are not able to absorb enough nutrients from food.  Over time, a range of problems may develop as a result of the body's reaction to gluten — from skin rashes and lactose intolerance to infertility, bone weakness and nerve damage. These can often happen even in the absence of digestive symptoms.  If you have symptoms of celiac disease, see your doctor to have them evaluated before changing your diet. Diagnosing the disease typically involves a blood test and a biopsy of tissue from the small intestine to check for damage. In a few cases, genetic testing may also be helpful.  Celiac disease has no cure but can be managed by avoiding all sources of gluten. Once gluten is eliminated from your diet, your small intestine can begin to heal. The earlier the disease is found, the less time healing takes. For example, most children diagnosed with celiac disease heal completely within six months when gluten is removed from their diets.  Full healing can take longer for adults, sometimes up to a year or two. People who have symptoms for quite a while may take longer to heal, and some never completely recover. In addition, certain advanced complications of the disease may not be reversible, including infertility and severe bone loss. For most people with celiac disease, however, symptoms ease significantly once they start to avoid gluten.  Completely eliminating gluten from your diet can be challenging because gluten is found in many common foods, including bread, pasta, cookies and pizza crusts, just to name a few. But those who have celiac disease need to completely eliminate gluten from their diet, because even small amounts can continue to damage the small intestine. Fortunately, as awareness about celiac disease has increased, more gluten-free items are available in many grocery stores. If you have been diagnosed with celiac disease, consult with a dietitian who can help you plan a healthy gluten-free diet.  — Joseph Murray, M.D., Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.    #Celiac Disease   COMMENT          Follow   Report    Please login or register to post a comment.

Celiac disease tends to take everyone by surprise — both those who receive the diagnosis and family doctors who are shocked when a physically robust patient’s blood work comes back positive for the disease.  A couple of decades ago, the stereotypical celiac patient was a pale, malnourished child. However, as screening tests become more sophisticated, we’re learning that celiac disease is surprisingly common, affecting one in every 100 people in the United States. According to a 2009 study, celiac disease touches more than four times the number of people it had in the 1950s. Researchers can’t yet explain this dramatic rise in incidence.  Celiac disease can begin at any time in a person’s life, and there is no consistent set of symptoms. Some people lose a tremendous amount of weight; others experience fatigue, joint pain, or seizures; and sometimes there are no symptoms at all and the disease is discovered quite by accident. In fact, people often learn they have celiac disease when their doctors investigate possible causes for unexplained anemia or nutrient deficiencies. One minute you’re having blood drawn for tests during a routine physical examination and feeling just fine, and the next you’re facing nonnegotiable changes to your eating habits. If that scenario sounds familiar, you’re actually lucky to have caught the disease. If celiac remains undiagnosed or untreated, it can lead to osteoporosis, reproductive problems, skin rashes, epilepsy, and even some cancer s. The good news is that celiac disease is currently treated entirely with dietary changes, so feeling better is as simple as knowing which foods are toxic to your gut.  What Affects Celiac Disease?  Celiac disease (also called celiac sprue, nontropical sprue, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is genetic. All individuals who develop celiac are born with a genetic predisposition for the disease, but the age of onset can vary from infancy to old age. (Some people are diagnosed at birth or during childhood, but in many people, the disease lies dormant until it is triggered later in life.) No one knows exactly what causes celiac disease to become active, but experts believe that times of extreme emotional or physical stress — including surgery, a viral infection, pregnancy, or childbirth — can set the stage. Researchers are also beginning to explore whether changes in the types of bacteria living in your gut may be the spark that ignites adult-onset celiac.  It’s important to remember that celiac disease is NOT a food allergy. Some practitioners call it an allergy as a shorthand way to explain why those with a diagnosis need to avoid certain foods, but that description is both misleading and dangerous. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder, a category of diseases in which the body’s immune system attacks itself. The immune system reacts to a protein called gluten, which is found in wheat, and related proteins found in rye and barley.  When even the smallest amount of gluten enters the digestive system, it sets in motion a cascade of inflammatory processes. The immune system begins to attack the body’s own tissue, resulting in damage to the small intestine. Counter to what you may think, the small intestine is not merely a smooth tube connecting the stomach to the colon; rather, its inner lining is jam-packed with protruding ridges called villi, which absorb nutrients as food passes through. Celiac disease causes inflammation that damages and sometimes destroys the villi, which means they can’t do their job; the result is that the nutrients your body needs end up passing through your digestive system unabsorbed and are eliminated in waste. The outcome of this damage varies depending on the extent of the disease. In mild cases, there are no overt symptoms, but blood tests might reveal a deficiency in certain nutrients, especially folate, vitamin B12, or iron (which can result in anemia). Over time, poor calcium and vitamin D absorption can lead to osteoporosis. In some people, celiac disease causes embarrassing and sometimes life-altering gastrointestinal symptoms, including gas, bloating, diarrhea or constipation, and weight loss. Other problems associated with celiac disease include nerve damage, migraines , seizures, infertility or miscarriages, joint pain, and even some cancer s, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cancer of the esophagus or small intestine. The longer celiac goes untreated, the greater the risk of harm.    Recently diagnosed with celiac disease? Get tips to make reading labels easier!

Celiac disease damages the villi, leaving your body unable to absorb nutrients necessary for health and growth.      Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), sometimes called sprue or coeliac, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.  If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents absorption of some nutrients (malabsorption). The intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia, and can lead to serious complications.  In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development, in addition to the symptoms seen in adults.  There's no cure for celiac disease — but for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and promote intestinal healing.      Symptoms The signs and symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly and are different in children and adults. The most common signs for adults are diarrhea, fatigue and weight loss. Adults may also experience bloating and gas, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and vomiting.  However, more than half of adults with celiac disease have signs and symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including:   Anemia, usually resulting from iron deficiency  Loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or softening of bone (osteomalacia)  Itchy, blistery skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)  Damage to dental enamel  Mouth ulcers  Headaches and fatigue  Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment  Joint pain  Reduced functioning of the spleen (hyposplenism)  Acid reflux and heartburn   Children  In children under 2 years old, typical signs and symptoms of celiac disease include:   Vomiting  Chronic diarrhea  Swollen belly  Failure to thrive  Poor appetite  Muscle wasting   Older children may experience:   Diarrhea  Constipation  Weight loss  Irritability  Short stature  Delayed puberty  Neurological symptoms, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, headaches, lack of muscle coordination and seizures   Dermatitis herpetiformis  Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, blistering skin disease that stems from intestinal gluten intolerance. The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp and buttocks.  Dermatitis herpetiformis is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the disease may not produce noticeable digestive symptoms.  Doctors treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medication, or both, to control the rash.  When to see a doctor  Consult your doctor if you have diarrhea or digestive discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks. Consult your child's doctor if your child is pale, irritable or failing to grow or has a potbelly and foul-smelling, bulky stools.  Be sure to consult your doctor before trying a gluten-free diet. If you stop or even reduce the amount of gluten you eat before you're tested for celiac disease, you may change the test results.  Celiac disease tends to run in families. If someone in your family has the condition, ask your doctor if you should be tested. Also ask your doctor about testing if you or someone in your family has a risk factor for celiac disease, such as type 1 diabetes.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Celiac disease occurs from an interaction between genes, eating foods with gluten and other environmental factors, but the precise cause isn't known. Infant feeding practices, gastrointestinal infections and gut bacteria might contribute to developing celiac disease.  Sometimes celiac disease is triggered — or becomes active for the first time — after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection or severe emotional stress.  When the body's immune system overreacts to gluten in food, the reaction damages the tiny, hair-like projections (villi) that line the small intestine. Villi absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat. If your villi are damaged, you can't get enough nutrients, no matter how much you eat.  Some gene variations appear to increase the risk of developing the disease. But having those gene variants doesn't mean you'll get celiac disease, which suggests that additional factors must be involved.  The rate of celiac disease in Western countries is estimated at about 1 percent of the population. Celiac disease is most common in Caucasians; however, it is now being diagnosed among many ethnic groups and is being found globally.  Risk factors Celiac disease can affect anyone. However, it tends to be more common in people who have:   A family member with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis  Type 1 diabetes  Down syndrome or Turner syndrome  Autoimmune thyroid disease  Microscopic colitis (lymphocytic or collagenous colitis)  Addison's disease  Rheumatoid arthritis   Complications Untreated, celiac disease can cause:   Malnutrition. The damage to your small intestine means it can't absorb enough nutrients. Malnutrition can lead to anemia and weight loss. In children, malnutrition can cause slow growth and short stature.  Loss of calcium and bone density. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D may lead to a softening of the bone (osteomalacia or rickets) in children and a loss of bone density (osteoporosis) in adults.  Infertility and miscarriage. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D can contribute to reproductive issues.  Lactose intolerance. Damage to your small intestine may cause you to experience abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating lactose-containing dairy products, even though they don't contain gluten. Once your intestine has healed, you may be able to tolerate dairy products again. However, some people continue to experience lactose intolerance despite successful management of celiac disease.  Cancer. People with celiac disease who don't maintain a gluten-free diet have a greater risk of developing several forms of cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer.  Neurological problems. Some people with celiac disease may develop neurological problems such as seizures or peripheral neuropathy (disease of the nerves that lead to the hands and feet).   In children, celiac disease can also lead to failure to thrive, delayed puberty, weight loss, irritability and dental enamel defects, anemia, arthritis, and epilepsy.  Nonresponsive celiac disease  As many as 30 percent of people with celiac disease may not have, or be able to maintain, a good response to a gluten-free diet. This condition, known as nonresponsive celiac disease, is often due to contamination of the diet with gluten. Therefore it's important to work with a dietitian.  People with nonresponsive celiac disease may have additional conditions, such as bacteria in the small intestine (bacterial overgrowth), microscopic colitis, poor pancreas function, irritable bowel syndrome or intolerance to disaccharides (lactose and fructose). Or, they may have refractory celiac disease.  Refractory celiac disease  In rare instances, the intestinal injury of celiac disease persists and leads to substantial malabsorption, even though you have followed a strict gluten-free diet. This combination is known as refractory celiac disease.  If you continue to experience signs and symptoms despite following a gluten-free diet for six months to one year, your doctor may recommend further testing and look for other explanations for your symptoms. Your doctor may recommend treatment with a steroid to reduce intestinal inflammation, or a medication that suppresses your immune system. All patients with celiac disease should be followed up to monitor the response of their disease to treatment.

Both men and women are at risk for celiac disease. People of any age or race can develop this genetic autoimmune condition. However, there are some factors that can increase your risk of developing celiac disease.  Having a Biological Relative with Celiac Disease  Celiac disease is genetically based, so it is more common in those with a family history of the condition. This means that if you have a blood relative with celiac disease, you are at an increased risk for developing it, too. This autoimmune condition occurs in up to 5-10% of family members of people diagnosed with celiac disease.  Learn more about Celiac Disease in Families »  HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 Genes  About 95% of people with celiac disease have the HLA-DQ2 gene and most of the remaining 5% have the HLA-DQ8 gene. Genetic testing can determine if you have one or both of these genes.  It is important to note that having the gene means you are at-risk for developing celiac disease, it but does not mean that you definitely have the disease. A positive genetic test should be followed up with a celiac disease blood panel to determine if you have celiac disease. If your genetic test returns with a negative result, you can virtually rule out celiac disease.  Some Autoimmune Diseases  Having an autoimmune disease makes you more likely to develop other autoimmune diseases, like celiac disease. Thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes are examples of other autoimmune diseases.       OUR SPONSORS & PARTNERS  Advertise with us                   DO YOU THINK YOU MAY HAVE CELIAC DISEASE?

But if she has celiac disease , her biggest wish may be that her baby does not inherit the inability to handle gluten. Celiac Disease: The Risk of Inheriting the Disorder Among the general population, about 30 percent of people carry the genes associated with celiac disease, but only about 5 percent will actually develop the disease, says Stefano Guandalini, MD, professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital, and founder and medical director of the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center. If a mother has genes associated with celiac disease, her child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the genes, he says. (The same is true if the father has the gene). That means a child whose mother has celiac disease has a one in 22 chance of developing the disease. Celiac Disease: How to Minimize Your Baby’s Risk There are things you can do to prevent your baby from developing celiac disease, or to delay the symptoms . Here’s how. Stay on a strict gluten-free diet during pregnancy. Anyone with celiac disease should be strict about following a gluten-free diet , but especially women who are pregnant, Dr. Guandalini says. If a pregnant woman eats gluten during pregnancy, the disease will become active, which leads to the malabsorption of nutrients in both the mother and baby, he says. Active celiac disease can also lead to miscarriage, or infertility if you’re trying to get pregnant. Consider a genetic test for your baby. Celiac disease won’t be active until gluten is introduced to your baby, so your doctor can’t tell you if your newborn baby has it. But the doctor can test your baby to see if he carries the gene or genes that are associated with celiac disease. If the test is negative, you can rest easy and know your child won’t get celiac disease. If the test is positive, doctors recommend giving your child an antibody blood test around age 3 and then every two to three years to see if the disease has become active. However, if you see symptoms of celiac disease earlier, don’t delay getting the test, Guandalini says. Breastfeed for at least six months. All babies benefit from the immune support breast milk offers, and breast milk also helps with gastrointestinal function and other areas of development. But research has shown that babies who are at risk for celiac disease may see a delay in symptoms if they’re breastfed. Recent research has found that babies who are breastfed have a lower risk of developing celiac disease later in life. Introduce gluten slowly between four to six months. Doctors think that when and how gluten is introduced to a baby may influence whether the baby becomes intolerant to it. In a recent study of Swedish children, researchers found that introducing gluten while breastfeeding lowered the risk of the child developing celiac disease by age 2. Continuing to breastfeed after introducing gluten also protected the children, the study showed. The amount you give your baby is also key. That same study found that giving babies large amounts of gluten raised their risk of getting celiac disease compared with babies who were given small to medium amounts. Guandalini suggests giving your baby small amounts of gluten between four and six months while you breastfeed. “I usually recommend starting with barley cereal,” he says. If your baby handles gluten well, go on to feed him a normal diet. Keep an eye out for symptoms. Signs of celiac disease in babies include vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, irritability, and a failure to grow, Guandalini says. “It would typically take weeks or months to see ill effects that may be the result of celiac disease,” he says. If you notice these symptoms, have your baby tested with an antibody blood test. Resist the urge to feed him a gluten-free diet if he hasn’t been diagnosed. A gluten-free diet is hard to follow, and it would be even harder if it’s not medically necessary, Guandalini says. Also, gluten-free baked goods aren’t fortified the way other baked goods are, so it’s possible that your child could miss out on essential nutrients on a gluten-free diet, Guandalini says. In addition, taking gluten out of the diet can interfere with getting a proper diagnosis. People who have been following a gluten-free diet may test negative for celiac disease even when they actually do have it. “The gluten-free diet is a medical treatment for a disease,” he says. “One wouldn’t undergo chemotherapy if they suspected they might have cancer. Similarly, one should be properly diagnosed with celiac disease before undertaking its treatment.” By carefully planning how and when you introduce gluten, you can protect your baby from celiac disease.

Everything You Need to Know About the Autoimmune Condition Causes Symptoms Gluten Intolerance Treatment Diet Resources By Lindsey Konkel Medically Reviewed by Kareem Sassi, MD You’ve undoubtedly heard about the gluten-free diet, a fad that’s drawn a huge following among celebrities and has even spawned books on the eating approach. But what do you know about the condition that requires following the diet — and what might happen to those individuals who don’t? What Is Celiac Disease? The condition that requires avoiding gluten to manage symptoms is celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that prevents proper nutrient absorption and the digestion of gluten. When people diagnosed with celiac are exposed to gluten — a binding protein common in grains but also in makeup products — the immune system malfunctions and attacks the walls of the small intestine, which is responsible for absorbing nutrients from food. ( 1 ) People with celiac disease have a swollen and irritated small intestine, which can interfere with this absorption, leading to nutrient deficiencies. How Common Is Celiac Disease? Regardless of what age you’re looking at, celiac disease is seriously underdiagnosed, likely because its symptoms manifest differently depending on who you are. ( 2 ) For example, some people with the disease have digestive problems, especially diarrhea, while others experience problems in other parts of the body, such as anemia , fatigue, headaches, and joint pain. But best estimates put the prevalence of the condition around 1 in 100 people, or about 1 percent, of the U.S. population.

The Link Between Hypothyroidism and Celiac Disease    Is a Gluten-Free Diet Good for Psoriasis? What Are the Possible Causes and Risk Factors of Celiac Disease? Unfortunately, researchers haven’t yet been able to identify what exactly causes celiac disease. But they think it has something to do with genetics combined with environmental factors. Having a family member with celiac can put you at a higher risk for the disease, research shows. For example, someone with a first-degree relative has a 1 in 22 chance of getting the condition, too. ( 4 ) Indeed, there’s a so-called “celiac gene.” Among those with celiac, 95 percent have the HLA-DQ2 gene, and most of the rest of that remaining 5 percent have the HLA-DQ8 gene. ( 5 ) People with a genetic disorder, such as Down syndrome or Turner syndrome , are also more likely to develop the disease. ( 6 ) If you have another autoimmune disorder, you also are more likely to develop celiac disease. Those conditions include: ( 7 ) Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus Thyroid disease Sjogren's syndrome Type 1 diabetes Learn More About Possible Celiac Disease Causes and Risk Factors What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Celiac Disease, and How Is It Diagnosed? As previously mentioned, the signs and symptoms of celiac disease vary widely based on the individual. In fact, some people with celiac are asymptomatic. Generally speaking, though, there are some tell-tale signs of celiac that you should know. First, digestive problems can occur in anyone with celiac disease, but they may be more common in children with the disease than adults. Here are some of the digestive symptoms that may occur: ( 8 ) Abdominal bloating, gas, or stomach pain Chronic diarrhea (may be constant, or on and off for several weeks) Constipation Pale, foul-smelling, or oily stool Nausea and vomiting Unexplained weight loss On the flip side, celiac disease can cause problems in other parts of the body, too. And some of these symptoms are more common in adults than in children. continue reading below  Slideshow  11 Icky but Interesting Facts About Poop Your poop can reveal serious signs of infections, digestive problems, and potentially even early signs of cancer. Learn what’s going on down there. Nondigestive symptoms may include: (8) Anemia (low red blood cell count) Fatigue (extreme tiredness that doesn't go away with sleep) Infertility or miscarriages Missed menstrual periods Depression or anxiety Seizures Canker sores or ulcers inside the mouth Bone or joint pain Osteoporosis (weak, porous bones that break more easily) Itchy, blistery skin rashes Hair loss Tingling or numbness in hands or feet Headaches How Is Celiac Disease Diagnosed? A number of tests can help your doctor figure out whether you have celiac disease or another digestive condition. Your doctor may recommend: ( 9 ) Blood Tests Your blood sample will be checked for special proteins called antibodies. Certain antibodies tend to be elevated in people with celiac disease. Before your blood test, you should continue to eat foods containing gluten. Cutting out gluten before testing is complete could delay your diagnosis. Endoscopy  Your doctor may ask a gastroenterologist to perform an endoscopy to confirm your diagnosis if a blood test shows you may have celiac disease. You'll swallow a small, flexible tube containing a tiny camera. Through this tube, your doctor will perform a biopsy , removing a tiny piece of tissue from the wall of your small intestine. A specialist (usually a pathologist) will view this tissue under a microscope to see whether it has been damaged by celiac disease. Genetic Testing Your doctor may order a genetic test to rule out a celiac disease diagnosis. Most people with celiac disease carry a certain variant of the HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 genes. But many people without celiac disease also have these variants, so celiac disease can't be diagnosed by genetic testing alone. Bone Density Testing If you have celiac disease, your doctor will probably recommend a test to check for bone loss. This may not happen until you've been following a gluten-free diet for a year. This test uses a scanning machine similar to an X-ray . If the scan shows significant bone loss, you may need dietary supplements or other treatments to encourage bone growth.

Easy Ways to Tame Excessive Gas    There’s Gluten in That? 13 Surprising Items That Contain Gluten    Home Remedies to Relieve Gas and Bloating Is It Celiac Disease, Gluten Intolerance, or a Wheat Allergy? Unfortunately, receiving a celiac disease diagnosis can be tough for many people because its symptoms are often confused with those of other conditions. But it’s important to know that celiac is distinct from those conditions, including gluten intolerance and a wheat allergy, because of its autoimmune status, whereby the immune system attacks the small intestine, leading to malabsorption. Could Your Symptoms Be the Result of a Wheat Allergy? If you’ve been tested for celiac and the results prove negative, there’s a chance you simply have an allergy to wheat. Wheat allergies affect millions of Americans, and symptoms include: ( 10 ) Headaches Stuffy or runny nose Hives or a skin rash Nausea and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea or vomiting Asthma Anaphylaxis (though this is less common) More in Digestive Health    Is It Gas Pain or Something More Serious? These symptoms may appear after eating foods with wheat, including bread, cereal, or granola. Because these foods also contain gluten, a wheat allergy is commonly called a “gluten allergy,” though there’s actually no such thing. Your doctor can do a blood test to diagnose you with a wheat allergy. (10) Treatment includes avoiding foods with wheat and using either corticosteroids or antihistamines. You should also have epinephrine on hand in case of an allergic attack. (10) Could You Have Intolerance to Gluten (Nonceliac Gluten-Sensitivity)? Gluten intolerance, also called nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), is a possibility if you’ve tested negative for both celiac disease and a wheat allergy. But unfortunately, there isn’t a good test to diagnose this condition. If your doctor suspects you have gluten intolerance, he or she may suggest a blood test then a biopsy. If the biopsy is normal, your physician may suspect NCGS. ( 11 ) The main treatment for NCGS is a gluten-free diet, but as with celiac, be sure to work with your healthcare team to make sure you’re properly nourishing your body. Should You Avoid Gluten if You Test Negative for These Conditions? Probably not, experts say. In fact, research suggests adopting a gluten-free diet without a firm medical reason to do so may be bad for you — for example, it’s linked to an increased risk for heart disease, anemia, and osteoporosis.

While you might come across alternative treatments for celiac disease online, developing a gluten-free diet is your best bet for keeping symptoms under control. ( 13 ) If you’ve just received a celiac disease diagnosis, the news may be tough to hear. For some, it might mean completely overhauling your diet. But working with a dietitian can help you transition to a gluten-free diet while still eating healthy and nutritious foods. You'll be instructed how to: Use food and product labels to identify ingredients that contain gluten Understand which foods are naturally gluten-free Find and eliminate hidden sources of gluten from the diet Make healthy food choices Design meal plans After you start on a gluten-free diet, you'll continue to see your doctor for periodic checkups to make sure your condition is improving. Many doctors recommend a follow-up visit four to six weeks after starting on the diet. But rest assured that you may start feeling better within days of starting a gluten-free diet. ( 14 ) Are There Supplements That Are Good for People With Celiac Disease? People with celiac disease are at risk for nutritional deficiencies because the disease can limit the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from food. ( 15 ) Your doctor can test for nutritional deficiencies with a simple blood test. People with celiac disease often have low levels of: ( 16 ) Calcium Vitamin B12 Folate Vitamin A Vitamin E Vitamin D Vitamin K Taking a multivitamin or nutritional supplement can help you build your levels of essential nutrients back up. But keep in mind that some vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements contain an ingredient called lecithin. Lecithin can be a hidden source of gluten. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any nutritional supplement to make sure it doesn't contain gluten. RELATED: 7 Common Nutrient Deficiencies Gluten-free diets are sometimes low in fiber, which can lead to constipation. A fiber supplement with psyllium seed husks can also help, as can fiber-rich foods, like fruits and veggies. (16) Can Taking Medication Help Manage Celiac Disease? More in Digestive Health    Gluten, Depression, and Anxiety: The Gut-Brain Link A small percentage of people with celiac disease find that their symptoms don't improve, even with a strict gluten-free diet. Symptoms may go away initially but then return, even in the absence of gluten. It's unclear why this happens. Doctors call this refractory celiac disease. If you have refractory celiac disease, your doctor may prescribe a steroid medication, such as Deltasone (prednisone ). ( 17 ) Steroids are typically taken for a short period of time to suppress the immune system and stop the body's harmful immune response. What Are the Possible Complications of Untreated Celiac Disease? Getting treatment for the disease and changing lifestyle habits, such as following a gluten-free diet, can help prevent long-term complications. Long-term complications of celiac disease may include: ( 18 ) Malnutrition Anemia (low red blood cell count) Osteoporosis (weak bones caused by loss of bone density) Infertility or miscarriage Certain cancers (intestinal lymphoma , small bowel cancer) Lactose intolerance Dermatitis herpetiformis (an itchy rash of bumps and blisters) or other skin conditions Learn More About the Treatments and Possible Health Complications of Celiac Disease continue reading below Related Conditions Anemia  Diverticulitis  Lupus  Rheumatoid Arthritis  Thyroid Disease  Type 1 Diabetes  Osteoporosis  Ulcerative Colitis How to Develop a Gluten-Free Diet to Control Celiac Disease Gluten is found in many commonly loved foods, including traditional pizza crust, several types of sandwich breads, pasta, tortillas, cake, cookies, and even soy sauce. (1) But for people with celiac disease, knowing the foods and products gluten lurks in — and then avoiding them — is key for keeping symptoms controlled and preventing an attack. Foods to Avoid Any foods made with wheat, barley, or rye contain some amount of gluten. That means that people with celiac disease shouldn't eat most breakfast cereal, bread, pasta, and processed foods. (1) Processed foods that may contain gluten include: (1, 19 ) Bouillon cubes Brown rice syrup Candy Chewing gum Chips, including seasoned tortilla and potato chips Cold cuts, hot dogs, salami, and sausage Communion wafers French fries Gravy Imitation fish Rice mixes Soy sauce Beer and malt beverages Soups and sauces are common sources of hidden gluten, as wheat is often used as a thickener. Pay special attention to sauces or soups that are cream based. Gluten-Free Foods Cutting gluten out of your diet may seem like a difficult task, but many foods are naturally gluten-free. In general, the following food groups are naturally gluten-free: Fruits Vegetables Fresh cuts of meat and poultry Fish and seafood Dairy Beans, legumes, and nuts Beware, though, that prepared or processed versions of any of the above foods, such as sausage or ice cream, may contain gluten. continue reading below  Slideshow  10 Foods to Help Relieve Constipation Many gut-friendly foods also don’t contain gluten.

This means picking a place that serves naturally gluten-free foods or has a special gluten-free menu. Inform your waiter. Let them know you have celiac disease and may get sick if you eat anything containing gluten, including flour, bread crumbs, or soy sauce. Also ask them to inform the chef or cook. This way, you’ll have more confidence that nothing on your plate has touched gluten. Ask questions. Don't assume anything is gluten-free. Omelets, for instance, may have pancake batter added to the egg mixture to make them fluffier, and baked potatoes can be coated with flour to make the skins brown and crispy.

CSA Archives/Getty Images       More in Celiac Disease       Symptoms     Diagnosis     Living With     Nutrition     Gluten Sensitivity     Related Conditions        If you have a close relative who was diagnosed with celiac disease , your chances of developing the condition as well are higher than normal. Fortunately, though, your risk may not be as high as you think. Even though it's common for there to be multiple celiacs in families, your relative's diagnosis in no way means you're certain to get the condition too. There are many other factors involved. First, the short answer: If you are a first-degree relative (parent, child, brother or sister) of a person with celiac disease, you have a 1 in 22 chance of developing the disease in your lifetime, according to the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center.          If you are a second-degree relative (aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, grandparent, grandchild or half-sibling), your risk is 1 in 39. There's no research indicating the probability of two celiac parents having celiac children, but genetics indicates it's likely higher than the 1 in 22 chances of first-degree relatives. But again, it's not certain, since there are other factors involved. Therefore, people whose close relatives have been diagnosed have a somewhat high chance of also being diagnosed—higher than the overall population, where the rate is less than 1%, but far from a certainty. And people whose more distant relatives have been diagnosed also have a higher-than-average chance of also being diagnosed, but again, it's far from certain that they'll ever develop the condition. Celiac: Genetics and Environment It's about the genetics, but also about other factors, some of which haven't even been identified yet.   You probably know that celiac disease is linked to your genes—the vast majority of people who develop the condition carry at least one of the two so-called celiac disease genes (in technical terms, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 ). You inherit those genes from your mother and/or father... which means the condition can run in your family.         If you inherit the genes from both parents (as people with two celiac parents might do) then your risk likely is higher still. But it takes more than having the gene to make you develop celiac disease, and in fact researchers aren't certain why some people with similar genetics get celiac while others do not. Celiac disease is caused by a combination of genetics and factors in a person's environment. In some people, stress or pregnancy might appear to trigger the development of celiac disease, since celiac disease symptoms begin shortly after a stressful life event or a pregnancy. But these conditions don't actually cause celiac disease, and it's possible that subtle symptoms had been present for a long time prior to the pregnancy or stressful event. Getting Tested for Celiac Disease Genes If you have a parent or another close (first-degree) relative who has been diagnosed with celiac disease, medical guidelines recommend that you get tested for celiac disease . This involves getting a blood test and then, if the blood test is positive, undergoing a procedure called an endoscopy to look for celiac-related damage directly in your small intestine. If you have a relative who's just been diagnosed with the condition, you may want to talk to your physician about ordering the blood test, since you don't need symptoms to be diagnosed with celiac disease .         You also can consider getting tested to see if you carry one or both of the celiac disease genes. This type of celiac disease genetic testing won't tell you if you actually have celiac disease (you need the blood test for that), but it will tell you if you have the "right" genes to develop celiac disease. A Word from Verywell If your celiac disease genetic testing shows you do have the "celiac gene," you shouldn't panic. Most people with the celiac gene never develop the condition. If you (or your child) carry the gene, your best bet is to get the testing recommended by your doctor, and watch carefully for signs and symptoms of celiac disease.   In fact, you can have your antibody levels checked regularly via a blood test, even if you have no obvious signs of the disease . Regular monitoring will allow the disease to be diagnosed quickly if it does develop, and early diagnosis will dramatically reduce the risk of associated complications. On the other hand, if you do not carry the genes for celiac disease, then you and your children (unless they have inherited the celiac disease genes from their other parent) are at an extremely low risk for developing celiac disease.

Both men and women are at risk for celiac disease. People of any age or race can develop this genetic autoimmune condition. However, there are some factors that can increase your risk of developing celiac disease.  Having a Biological Relative with Celiac Disease  Celiac disease is genetically based, so it is more common in those with a family history of the condition. This means that if you have a blood relative with celiac disease, you are at an increased risk for developing it, too. This autoimmune condition occurs in up to 5-10% of family members of people diagnosed with celiac disease.  Learn more about Celiac Disease in Families »  HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 Genes  About 95% of people with celiac disease have the HLA-DQ2 gene and most of the remaining 5% have the HLA-DQ8 gene. Genetic testing can determine if you have one or both of these genes.  It is important to note that having the gene means you are at-risk for developing celiac disease, it but does not mean that you definitely have the disease. A positive genetic test should be followed up with a celiac disease blood panel to determine if you have celiac disease. If your genetic test returns with a negative result, you can virtually rule out celiac disease.  Some Autoimmune Diseases  Having an autoimmune disease makes you more likely to develop other autoimmune diseases, like celiac disease. Thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes are examples of other autoimmune diseases.       OUR SPONSORS & PARTNERS  Advertise with us                   DO YOU THINK YOU MAY HAVE CELIAC DISEASE?

What causes this disease?  Answer:  Celiac disease is a digestive disorder triggered by gluten, a protein found in foods that contain wheat, barley or rye. When people who have celiac disease eat gluten, the result is a reaction in their small intestine that can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating and weight loss. Early diagnosis of celiac disease is important because if left untreated the disorder can result in serious complications.  Celiac disease is an immune disorder. The immune system mistakenly targets 'friends,' like foods or even healthy organs and tissue. When a person has celiac disease, the body's immune system overreacts in response to gluten, damaging the small intestine and reducing its ability to absorb nutrients.  The underlying cause of celiac disease appears to be based, in part, on a person's genetic makeup. Research has found that celiac disease tends to run in families, and some gene types increase a person's risk for developing the disease. There's more involved than just genetics, though. Most people who have the gene types that put them at risk for celiac disease never develop the disorder, while others begin having symptoms early in life, and still others are not affected until their 60s or older.  Conditions that put a person's immune system on high alert may activate the disease. For example, some research suggests that certain infections, particularly gastroenteritis, could spark the immune system response associated with celiac disease. The disease is more common in children delivered by cesarean section. Pregnancy also may play a role. Some women develop the disease several months after giving birth.  When celiac disease begins, the most common symptoms are diarrhea, abdominal pain or bloating, especially after meals. People with celiac disease may lose weight because their bodies are not able to absorb enough nutrients from food.  Over time, a range of problems may develop as a result of the body's reaction to gluten — from skin rashes and lactose intolerance to infertility, bone weakness and nerve damage. These can often happen even in the absence of digestive symptoms.  If you have symptoms of celiac disease, see your doctor to have them evaluated before changing your diet. Diagnosing the disease typically involves a blood test and a biopsy of tissue from the small intestine to check for damage. In a few cases, genetic testing may also be helpful.  Celiac disease has no cure but can be managed by avoiding all sources of gluten. Once gluten is eliminated from your diet, your small intestine can begin to heal. The earlier the disease is found, the less time healing takes. For example, most children diagnosed with celiac disease heal completely within six months when gluten is removed from their diets.  Full healing can take longer for adults, sometimes up to a year or two. People who have symptoms for quite a while may take longer to heal, and some never completely recover. In addition, certain advanced complications of the disease may not be reversible, including infertility and severe bone loss. For most people with celiac disease, however, symptoms ease significantly once they start to avoid gluten.  Completely eliminating gluten from your diet can be challenging because gluten is found in many common foods, including bread, pasta, cookies and pizza crusts, just to name a few. But those who have celiac disease need to completely eliminate gluten from their diet, because even small amounts can continue to damage the small intestine. Fortunately, as awareness about celiac disease has increased, more gluten-free items are available in many grocery stores. If you have been diagnosed with celiac disease, consult with a dietitian who can help you plan a healthy gluten-free diet.  — Joseph Murray, M.D., Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.    #Celiac Disease   COMMENT          Follow   Report    Please login or register to post a comment.

Celiac disease tends to take everyone by surprise — both those who receive the diagnosis and family doctors who are shocked when a physically robust patient’s blood work comes back positive for the disease.  A couple of decades ago, the stereotypical celiac patient was a pale, malnourished child. However, as screening tests become more sophisticated, we’re learning that celiac disease is surprisingly common, affecting one in every 100 people in the United States. According to a 2009 study, celiac disease touches more than four times the number of people it had in the 1950s. Researchers can’t yet explain this dramatic rise in incidence.  Celiac disease can begin at any time in a person’s life, and there is no consistent set of symptoms. Some people lose a tremendous amount of weight; others experience fatigue, joint pain, or seizures; and sometimes there are no symptoms at all and the disease is discovered quite by accident. In fact, people often learn they have celiac disease when their doctors investigate possible causes for unexplained anemia or nutrient deficiencies. One minute you’re having blood drawn for tests during a routine physical examination and feeling just fine, and the next you’re facing nonnegotiable changes to your eating habits. If that scenario sounds familiar, you’re actually lucky to have caught the disease. If celiac remains undiagnosed or untreated, it can lead to osteoporosis, reproductive problems, skin rashes, epilepsy, and even some cancer s. The good news is that celiac disease is currently treated entirely with dietary changes, so feeling better is as simple as knowing which foods are toxic to your gut.  What Affects Celiac Disease?  Celiac disease (also called celiac sprue, nontropical sprue, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is genetic. All individuals who develop celiac are born with a genetic predisposition for the disease, but the age of onset can vary from infancy to old age. (Some people are diagnosed at birth or during childhood, but in many people, the disease lies dormant until it is triggered later in life.) No one knows exactly what causes celiac disease to become active, but experts believe that times of extreme emotional or physical stress — including surgery, a viral infection, pregnancy, or childbirth — can set the stage. Researchers are also beginning to explore whether changes in the types of bacteria living in your gut may be the spark that ignites adult-onset celiac.  It’s important to remember that celiac disease is NOT a food allergy. Some practitioners call it an allergy as a shorthand way to explain why those with a diagnosis need to avoid certain foods, but that description is both misleading and dangerous. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder, a category of diseases in which the body’s immune system attacks itself. The immune system reacts to a protein called gluten, which is found in wheat, and related proteins found in rye and barley.  When even the smallest amount of gluten enters the digestive system, it sets in motion a cascade of inflammatory processes. The immune system begins to attack the body’s own tissue, resulting in damage to the small intestine. Counter to what you may think, the small intestine is not merely a smooth tube connecting the stomach to the colon; rather, its inner lining is jam-packed with protruding ridges called villi, which absorb nutrients as food passes through. Celiac disease causes inflammation that damages and sometimes destroys the villi, which means they can’t do their job; the result is that the nutrients your body needs end up passing through your digestive system unabsorbed and are eliminated in waste. The outcome of this damage varies depending on the extent of the disease. In mild cases, there are no overt symptoms, but blood tests might reveal a deficiency in certain nutrients, especially folate, vitamin B12, or iron (which can result in anemia). Over time, poor calcium and vitamin D absorption can lead to osteoporosis. In some people, celiac disease causes embarrassing and sometimes life-altering gastrointestinal symptoms, including gas, bloating, diarrhea or constipation, and weight loss. Other problems associated with celiac disease include nerve damage, migraines , seizures, infertility or miscarriages, joint pain, and even some cancer s, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cancer of the esophagus or small intestine.

Celiac disease damages the villi, leaving your body unable to absorb nutrients necessary for health and growth.      Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), sometimes called sprue or coeliac, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.  If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents absorption of some nutrients (malabsorption). The intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia, and can lead to serious complications.  In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development, in addition to the symptoms seen in adults.  There's no cure for celiac disease — but for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and promote intestinal healing.      Symptoms The signs and symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly and are different in children and adults. The most common signs for adults are diarrhea, fatigue and weight loss. Adults may also experience bloating and gas, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and vomiting.  However, more than half of adults with celiac disease have signs and symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including:   Anemia, usually resulting from iron deficiency  Loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or softening of bone (osteomalacia)  Itchy, blistery skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)  Damage to dental enamel  Mouth ulcers  Headaches and fatigue  Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment  Joint pain  Reduced functioning of the spleen (hyposplenism)  Acid reflux and heartburn   Children  In children under 2 years old, typical signs and symptoms of celiac disease include:   Vomiting  Chronic diarrhea  Swollen belly  Failure to thrive  Poor appetite  Muscle wasting   Older children may experience:   Diarrhea  Constipation  Weight loss  Irritability  Short stature  Delayed puberty  Neurological symptoms, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, headaches, lack of muscle coordination and seizures   Dermatitis herpetiformis  Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, blistering skin disease that stems from intestinal gluten intolerance. The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp and buttocks.  Dermatitis herpetiformis is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the disease may not produce noticeable digestive symptoms.  Doctors treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medication, or both, to control the rash.  When to see a doctor  Consult your doctor if you have diarrhea or digestive discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks. Consult your child's doctor if your child is pale, irritable or failing to grow or has a potbelly and foul-smelling, bulky stools.  Be sure to consult your doctor before trying a gluten-free diet. If you stop or even reduce the amount of gluten you eat before you're tested for celiac disease, you may change the test results.  Celiac disease tends to run in families. If someone in your family has the condition, ask your doctor if you should be tested. Also ask your doctor about testing if you or someone in your family has a risk factor for celiac disease, such as type 1 diabetes.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Celiac disease occurs from an interaction between genes, eating foods with gluten and other environmental factors, but the precise cause isn't known. Infant feeding practices, gastrointestinal infections and gut bacteria might contribute to developing celiac disease.  Sometimes celiac disease is triggered — or becomes active for the first time — after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection or severe emotional stress.  When the body's immune system overreacts to gluten in food, the reaction damages the tiny, hair-like projections (villi) that line the small intestine. Villi absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat. If your villi are damaged, you can't get enough nutrients, no matter how much you eat.  Some gene variations appear to increase the risk of developing the disease. But having those gene variants doesn't mean you'll get celiac disease, which suggests that additional factors must be involved.  The rate of celiac disease in Western countries is estimated at about 1 percent of the population. Celiac disease is most common in Caucasians; however, it is now being diagnosed among many ethnic groups and is being found globally.  Risk factors Celiac disease can affect anyone. However, it tends to be more common in people who have:   A family member with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis  Type 1 diabetes  Down syndrome or Turner syndrome  Autoimmune thyroid disease  Microscopic colitis (lymphocytic or collagenous colitis)  Addison's disease  Rheumatoid arthritis   Complications Untreated, celiac disease can cause:   Malnutrition. The damage to your small intestine means it can't absorb enough nutrients. Malnutrition can lead to anemia and weight loss. In children, malnutrition can cause slow growth and short stature.  Loss of calcium and bone density. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D may lead to a softening of the bone (osteomalacia or rickets) in children and a loss of bone density (osteoporosis) in adults.  Infertility and miscarriage. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D can contribute to reproductive issues.  Lactose intolerance. Damage to your small intestine may cause you to experience abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating lactose-containing dairy products, even though they don't contain gluten. Once your intestine has healed, you may be able to tolerate dairy products again. However, some people continue to experience lactose intolerance despite successful management of celiac disease.  Cancer. People with celiac disease who don't maintain a gluten-free diet have a greater risk of developing several forms of cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer.  Neurological problems. Some people with celiac disease may develop neurological problems such as seizures or peripheral neuropathy (disease of the nerves that lead to the hands and feet).   In children, celiac disease can also lead to failure to thrive, delayed puberty, weight loss, irritability and dental enamel defects, anemia, arthritis, and epilepsy.  Nonresponsive celiac disease  As many as 30 percent of people with celiac disease may not have, or be able to maintain, a good response to a gluten-free diet. This condition, known as nonresponsive celiac disease, is often due to contamination of the diet with gluten. Therefore it's important to work with a dietitian.  People with nonresponsive celiac disease may have additional conditions, such as bacteria in the small intestine (bacterial overgrowth), microscopic colitis, poor pancreas function, irritable bowel syndrome or intolerance to disaccharides (lactose and fructose). Or, they may have refractory celiac disease.  Refractory celiac disease  In rare instances, the intestinal injury of celiac disease persists and leads to substantial malabsorption, even though you have followed a strict gluten-free diet. This combination is known as refractory celiac disease.  If you continue to experience signs and symptoms despite following a gluten-free diet for six months to one year, your doctor may recommend further testing and look for other explanations for your symptoms. Your doctor may recommend treatment with a steroid to reduce intestinal inflammation, or a medication that suppresses your immune system. All patients with celiac disease should be followed up to monitor the response of their disease to treatment.

Both men and women are at risk for celiac disease. People of any age or race can develop this genetic autoimmune condition. However, there are some factors that can increase your risk of developing celiac disease.  Having a Biological Relative with Celiac Disease  Celiac disease is genetically based, so it is more common in those with a family history of the condition. This means that if you have a blood relative with celiac disease, you are at an increased risk for developing it, too. This autoimmune condition occurs in up to 5-10% of family members of people diagnosed with celiac disease.  Learn more about Celiac Disease in Families »  HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 Genes  About 95% of people with celiac disease have the HLA-DQ2 gene and most of the remaining 5% have the HLA-DQ8 gene. Genetic testing can determine if you have one or both of these genes.  It is important to note that having the gene means you are at-risk for developing celiac disease, it but does not mean that you definitely have the disease. A positive genetic test should be followed up with a celiac disease blood panel to determine if you have celiac disease. If your genetic test returns with a negative result, you can virtually rule out celiac disease.  Some Autoimmune Diseases  Having an autoimmune disease makes you more likely to develop other autoimmune diseases, like celiac disease. Thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes are examples of other autoimmune diseases.       OUR SPONSORS & PARTNERS  Advertise with us                   DO YOU THINK YOU MAY HAVE CELIAC DISEASE?

But if she has celiac disease , her biggest wish may be that her baby does not inherit the inability to handle gluten. Celiac Disease: The Risk of Inheriting the Disorder Among the general population, about 30 percent of people carry the genes associated with celiac disease, but only about 5 percent will actually develop the disease, says Stefano Guandalini, MD, professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital, and founder and medical director of the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center. If a mother has genes associated with celiac disease, her child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the genes, he says. (The same is true if the father has the gene). That means a child whose mother has celiac disease has a one in 22 chance of developing the disease. Celiac Disease: How to Minimize Your Baby’s Risk There are things you can do to prevent your baby from developing celiac disease, or to delay the symptoms . Here’s how. Stay on a strict gluten-free diet during pregnancy. Anyone with celiac disease should be strict about following a gluten-free diet , but especially women who are pregnant, Dr. Guandalini says. If a pregnant woman eats gluten during pregnancy, the disease will become active, which leads to the malabsorption of nutrients in both the mother and baby, he says. Active celiac disease can also lead to miscarriage, or infertility if you’re trying to get pregnant. Consider a genetic test for your baby. Celiac disease won’t be active until gluten is introduced to your baby, so your doctor can’t tell you if your newborn baby has it. But the doctor can test your baby to see if he carries the gene or genes that are associated with celiac disease. If the test is negative, you can rest easy and know your child won’t get celiac disease. If the test is positive, doctors recommend giving your child an antibody blood test around age 3 and then every two to three years to see if the disease has become active. However, if you see symptoms of celiac disease earlier, don’t delay getting the test, Guandalini says. Breastfeed for at least six months. All babies benefit from the immune support breast milk offers, and breast milk also helps with gastrointestinal function and other areas of development. But research has shown that babies who are at risk for celiac disease may see a delay in symptoms if they’re breastfed. Recent research has found that babies who are breastfed have a lower risk of developing celiac disease later in life. Introduce gluten slowly between four to six months. Doctors think that when and how gluten is introduced to a baby may influence whether the baby becomes intolerant to it. In a recent study of Swedish children, researchers found that introducing gluten while breastfeeding lowered the risk of the child developing celiac disease by age 2. Continuing to breastfeed after introducing gluten also protected the children, the study showed. The amount you give your baby is also key. That same study found that giving babies large amounts of gluten raised their risk of getting celiac disease compared with babies who were given small to medium amounts. Guandalini suggests giving your baby small amounts of gluten between four and six months while you breastfeed. “I usually recommend starting with barley cereal,” he says. If your baby handles gluten well, go on to feed him a normal diet. Keep an eye out for symptoms. Signs of celiac disease in babies include vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, irritability, and a failure to grow, Guandalini says. “It would typically take weeks or months to see ill effects that may be the result of celiac disease,” he says. If you notice these symptoms, have your baby tested with an antibody blood test. Resist the urge to feed him a gluten-free diet if he hasn’t been diagnosed. A gluten-free diet is hard to follow, and it would be even harder if it’s not medically necessary, Guandalini says. Also, gluten-free baked goods aren’t fortified the way other baked goods are, so it’s possible that your child could miss out on essential nutrients on a gluten-free diet, Guandalini says. In addition, taking gluten out of the diet can interfere with getting a proper diagnosis. People who have been following a gluten-free diet may test negative for celiac disease even when they actually do have it. “The gluten-free diet is a medical treatment for a disease,” he says. “One wouldn’t undergo chemotherapy if they suspected they might have cancer. Similarly, one should be properly diagnosed with celiac disease before undertaking its treatment.” By carefully planning how and when you introduce gluten, you can protect your baby from celiac disease.

Everything You Need to Know About the Autoimmune Condition Causes Symptoms Gluten Intolerance Treatment Diet Resources By Lindsey Konkel Medically Reviewed by Kareem Sassi, MD You’ve undoubtedly heard about the gluten-free diet, a fad that’s drawn a huge following among celebrities and has even spawned books on the eating approach. But what do you know about the condition that requires following the diet — and what might happen to those individuals who don’t? What Is Celiac Disease? The condition that requires avoiding gluten to manage symptoms is celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that prevents proper nutrient absorption and the digestion of gluten. When people diagnosed with celiac are exposed to gluten — a binding protein common in grains but also in makeup products — the immune system malfunctions and attacks the walls of the small intestine, which is responsible for absorbing nutrients from food. ( 1 ) People with celiac disease have a swollen and irritated small intestine, which can interfere with this absorption, leading to nutrient deficiencies. How Common Is Celiac Disease? Regardless of what age you’re looking at, celiac disease is seriously underdiagnosed, likely because its symptoms manifest differently depending on who you are. ( 2 ) For example, some people with the disease have digestive problems, especially diarrhea, while others experience problems in other parts of the body, such as anemia , fatigue, headaches, and joint pain. But best estimates put the prevalence of the condition around 1 in 100 people, or about 1 percent, of the U.S. population.

Unfortunately, researchers haven’t yet been able to identify what exactly causes celiac disease. But they think it has something to do with genetics combined with environmental factors. Having a family member with celiac can put you at a higher risk for the disease, research shows. For example, someone with a first-degree relative has a 1 in 22 chance of getting the condition, too. ( 4 ) Indeed, there’s a so-called “celiac gene.” Among those with celiac, 95 percent have the HLA-DQ2 gene, and most of the rest of that remaining 5 percent have the HLA-DQ8 gene. ( 5 ) People with a genetic disorder, such as Down syndrome or Turner syndrome , are also more likely to develop the disease. ( 6 ) If you have another autoimmune disorder, you also are more likely to develop celiac disease. Those conditions include: ( 7 ) Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus Thyroid disease Sjogren's syndrome Type 1 diabetes Learn More About Possible Celiac Disease Causes and Risk Factors What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Celiac Disease, and How Is It Diagnosed? As previously mentioned, the signs and symptoms of celiac disease vary widely based on the individual. In fact, some people with celiac are asymptomatic. Generally speaking, though, there are some tell-tale signs of celiac that you should know. First, digestive problems can occur in anyone with celiac disease, but they may be more common in children with the disease than adults. Here are some of the digestive symptoms that may occur: ( 8 ) Abdominal bloating, gas, or stomach pain Chronic diarrhea (may be constant, or on and off for several weeks) Constipation Pale, foul-smelling, or oily stool Nausea and vomiting Unexplained weight loss On the flip side, celiac disease can cause problems in other parts of the body, too. And some of these symptoms are more common in adults than in children. continue reading below  Slideshow  11 Icky but Interesting Facts About Poop Your poop can reveal serious signs of infections, digestive problems, and potentially even early signs of cancer. Learn what’s going on down there. Nondigestive symptoms may include: (8) Anemia (low red blood cell count) Fatigue (extreme tiredness that doesn't go away with sleep) Infertility or miscarriages Missed menstrual periods Depression or anxiety Seizures Canker sores or ulcers inside the mouth Bone or joint pain Osteoporosis (weak, porous bones that break more easily) Itchy, blistery skin rashes Hair loss Tingling or numbness in hands or feet Headaches How Is Celiac Disease Diagnosed? A number of tests can help your doctor figure out whether you have celiac disease or another digestive condition. Your doctor may recommend: ( 9 ) Blood Tests Your blood sample will be checked for special proteins called antibodies. Certain antibodies tend to be elevated in people with celiac disease. Before your blood test, you should continue to eat foods containing gluten. Cutting out gluten before testing is complete could delay your diagnosis. Endoscopy  Your doctor may ask a gastroenterologist to perform an endoscopy to confirm your diagnosis if a blood test shows you may have celiac disease. You'll swallow a small, flexible tube containing a tiny camera. Through this tube, your doctor will perform a biopsy , removing a tiny piece of tissue from the wall of your small intestine. A specialist (usually a pathologist) will view this tissue under a microscope to see whether it has been damaged by celiac disease. Genetic Testing Your doctor may order a genetic test to rule out a celiac disease diagnosis. Most people with celiac disease carry a certain variant of the HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 genes. But many people without celiac disease also have these variants, so celiac disease can't be diagnosed by genetic testing alone. Bone Density Testing If you have celiac disease, your doctor will probably recommend a test to check for bone loss. This may not happen until you've been following a gluten-free diet for a year. This test uses a scanning machine similar to an X-ray . If the scan shows significant bone loss, you may need dietary supplements or other treatments to encourage bone growth.

Unfortunately, receiving a celiac disease diagnosis can be tough for many people because its symptoms are often confused with those of other conditions. But it’s important to know that celiac is distinct from those conditions, including gluten intolerance and a wheat allergy, because of its autoimmune status, whereby the immune system attacks the small intestine, leading to malabsorption. Could Your Symptoms Be the Result of a Wheat Allergy? If you’ve been tested for celiac and the results prove negative, there’s a chance you simply have an allergy to wheat. Wheat allergies affect millions of Americans, and symptoms include: ( 10 ) Headaches Stuffy or runny nose Hives or a skin rash Nausea and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea or vomiting Asthma Anaphylaxis (though this is less common) More in Digestive Health    Is It Gas Pain or Something More Serious? These symptoms may appear after eating foods with wheat, including bread, cereal, or granola. Because these foods also contain gluten, a wheat allergy is commonly called a “gluten allergy,” though there’s actually no such thing. Your doctor can do a blood test to diagnose you with a wheat allergy. (10) Treatment includes avoiding foods with wheat and using either corticosteroids or antihistamines. You should also have epinephrine on hand in case of an allergic attack. (10) Could You Have Intolerance to Gluten (Nonceliac Gluten-Sensitivity)? Gluten intolerance, also called nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), is a possibility if you’ve tested negative for both celiac disease and a wheat allergy. But unfortunately, there isn’t a good test to diagnose this condition. If your doctor suspects you have gluten intolerance, he or she may suggest a blood test then a biopsy. If the biopsy is normal, your physician may suspect NCGS. ( 11 ) The main treatment for NCGS is a gluten-free diet, but as with celiac, be sure to work with your healthcare team to make sure you’re properly nourishing your body. Should You Avoid Gluten if You Test Negative for These Conditions? Probably not, experts say. In fact, research suggests adopting a gluten-free diet without a firm medical reason to do so may be bad for you — for example, it’s linked to an increased risk for heart disease, anemia, and osteoporosis.

While you might come across alternative treatments for celiac disease online, developing a gluten-free diet is your best bet for keeping symptoms under control. ( 13 ) If you’ve just received a celiac disease diagnosis, the news may be tough to hear. For some, it might mean completely overhauling your diet. But working with a dietitian can help you transition to a gluten-free diet while still eating healthy and nutritious foods. You'll be instructed how to: Use food and product labels to identify ingredients that contain gluten Understand which foods are naturally gluten-free Find and eliminate hidden sources of gluten from the diet Make healthy food choices Design meal plans After you start on a gluten-free diet, you'll continue to see your doctor for periodic checkups to make sure your condition is improving. Many doctors recommend a follow-up visit four to six weeks after starting on the diet. But rest assured that you may start feeling better within days of starting a gluten-free diet. ( 14 ) Are There Supplements That Are Good for People With Celiac Disease? People with celiac disease are at risk for nutritional deficiencies because the disease can limit the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from food. ( 15 ) Your doctor can test for nutritional deficiencies with a simple blood test. People with celiac disease often have low levels of: ( 16 ) Calcium Vitamin B12 Folate Vitamin A Vitamin E Vitamin D Vitamin K Taking a multivitamin or nutritional supplement can help you build your levels of essential nutrients back up. But keep in mind that some vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements contain an ingredient called lecithin. Lecithin can be a hidden source of gluten. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any nutritional supplement to make sure it doesn't contain gluten. RELATED: 7 Common Nutrient Deficiencies Gluten-free diets are sometimes low in fiber, which can lead to constipation. A fiber supplement with psyllium seed husks can also help, as can fiber-rich foods, like fruits and veggies. (16) Can Taking Medication Help Manage Celiac Disease? More in Digestive Health    Gluten, Depression, and Anxiety: The Gut-Brain Link A small percentage of people with celiac disease find that their symptoms don't improve, even with a strict gluten-free diet. Symptoms may go away initially but then return, even in the absence of gluten. It's unclear why this happens. Doctors call this refractory celiac disease. If you have refractory celiac disease, your doctor may prescribe a steroid medication, such as Deltasone (prednisone ). ( 17 ) Steroids are typically taken for a short period of time to suppress the immune system and stop the body's harmful immune response. What Are the Possible Complications of Untreated Celiac Disease? Getting treatment for the disease and changing lifestyle habits, such as following a gluten-free diet, can help prevent long-term complications. Long-term complications of celiac disease may include: ( 18 ) Malnutrition Anemia (low red blood cell count) Osteoporosis (weak bones caused by loss of bone density) Infertility or miscarriage Certain cancers (intestinal lymphoma , small bowel cancer) Lactose intolerance Dermatitis herpetiformis (an itchy rash of bumps and blisters) or other skin conditions Learn More About the Treatments and Possible Health Complications of Celiac Disease continue reading below Related Conditions Anemia  Diverticulitis  Lupus  Rheumatoid Arthritis  Thyroid Disease  Type 1 Diabetes  Osteoporosis  Ulcerative Colitis How to Develop a Gluten-Free Diet to Control Celiac Disease Gluten is found in many commonly loved foods, including traditional pizza crust, several types of sandwich breads, pasta, tortillas, cake, cookies, and even soy sauce. (1) But for people with celiac disease, knowing the foods and products gluten lurks in — and then avoiding them — is key for keeping symptoms controlled and preventing an attack. Foods to Avoid Any foods made with wheat, barley, or rye contain some amount of gluten. That means that people with celiac disease shouldn't eat most breakfast cereal, bread, pasta, and processed foods. (1) Processed foods that may contain gluten include: (1, 19 ) Bouillon cubes Brown rice syrup Candy Chewing gum Chips, including seasoned tortilla and potato chips Cold cuts, hot dogs, salami, and sausage Communion wafers French fries Gravy Imitation fish Rice mixes Soy sauce Beer and malt beverages Soups and sauces are common sources of hidden gluten, as wheat is often used as a thickener. Pay special attention to sauces or soups that are cream based. Gluten-Free Foods Cutting gluten out of your diet may seem like a difficult task, but many foods are naturally gluten-free. In general, the following food groups are naturally gluten-free: Fruits Vegetables Fresh cuts of meat and poultry Fish and seafood Dairy Beans, legumes, and nuts Beware, though, that prepared or processed versions of any of the above foods, such as sausage or ice cream, may contain gluten. continue reading below  Slideshow  10 Foods to Help Relieve Constipation Many gut-friendly foods also don’t contain gluten.

This means picking a place that serves naturally gluten-free foods or has a special gluten-free menu. Inform your waiter. Let them know you have celiac disease and may get sick if you eat anything containing gluten, including flour, bread crumbs, or soy sauce. Also ask them to inform the chef or cook. This way, you’ll have more confidence that nothing on your plate has touched gluten. Ask questions. Don't assume anything is gluten-free. Omelets, for instance, may have pancake batter added to the egg mixture to make them fluffier, and baked potatoes can be coated with flour to make the skins brown and crispy.

CSA Archives/Getty Images       More in Celiac Disease       Symptoms     Diagnosis     Living With     Nutrition     Gluten Sensitivity     Related Conditions        If you have a close relative who was diagnosed with celiac disease , your chances of developing the condition as well are higher than normal. Fortunately, though, your risk may not be as high as you think. Even though it's common for there to be multiple celiacs in families, your relative's diagnosis in no way means you're certain to get the condition too. There are many other factors involved. First, the short answer: If you are a first-degree relative (parent, child, brother or sister) of a person with celiac disease, you have a 1 in 22 chance of developing the disease in your lifetime, according to the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center.          If you are a second-degree relative (aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, grandparent, grandchild or half-sibling), your risk is 1 in 39. There's no research indicating the probability of two celiac parents having celiac children, but genetics indicates it's likely higher than the 1 in 22 chances of first-degree relatives. But again, it's not certain, since there are other factors involved. Therefore, people whose close relatives have been diagnosed have a somewhat high chance of also being diagnosed—higher than the overall population, where the rate is less than 1%, but far from a certainty. And people whose more distant relatives have been diagnosed also have a higher-than-average chance of also being diagnosed, but again, it's far from certain that they'll ever develop the condition. Celiac: Genetics and Environment It's about the genetics, but also about other factors, some of which haven't even been identified yet.   You probably know that celiac disease is linked to your genes—the vast majority of people who develop the condition carry at least one of the two so-called celiac disease genes (in technical terms, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 ). You inherit those genes from your mother and/or father... which means the condition can run in your family.         If you inherit the genes from both parents (as people with two celiac parents might do) then your risk likely is higher still. But it takes more than having the gene to make you develop celiac disease, and in fact researchers aren't certain why some people with similar genetics get celiac while others do not. Celiac disease is caused by a combination of genetics and factors in a person's environment. In some people, stress or pregnancy might appear to trigger the development of celiac disease, since celiac disease symptoms begin shortly after a stressful life event or a pregnancy. But these conditions don't actually cause celiac disease, and it's possible that subtle symptoms had been present for a long time prior to the pregnancy or stressful event. Getting Tested for Celiac Disease Genes If you have a parent or another close (first-degree) relative who has been diagnosed with celiac disease, medical guidelines recommend that you get tested for celiac disease . This involves getting a blood test and then, if the blood test is positive, undergoing a procedure called an endoscopy to look for celiac-related damage directly in your small intestine. If you have a relative who's just been diagnosed with the condition, you may want to talk to your physician about ordering the blood test, since you don't need symptoms to be diagnosed with celiac disease .         You also can consider getting tested to see if you carry one or both of the celiac disease genes. This type of celiac disease genetic testing won't tell you if you actually have celiac disease (you need the blood test for that), but it will tell you if you have the "right" genes to develop celiac disease. A Word from Verywell If your celiac disease genetic testing shows you do have the "celiac gene," you shouldn't panic. Most people with the celiac gene never develop the condition. If you (or your child) carry the gene, your best bet is to get the testing recommended by your doctor, and watch carefully for signs and symptoms of celiac disease.   In fact, you can have your antibody levels checked regularly via a blood test, even if you have no obvious signs of the disease . Regular monitoring will allow the disease to be diagnosed quickly if it does develop, and early diagnosis will dramatically reduce the risk of associated complications. On the other hand, if you do not carry the genes for celiac disease, then you and your children (unless they have inherited the celiac disease genes from their other parent) are at an extremely low risk for developing celiac disease.
