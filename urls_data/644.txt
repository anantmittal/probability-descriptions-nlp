They do not need to settle on one area to pursue right away, and they can change directions. However, students should be sure to prepare for the long run - for their lifelong careers or multiple careers. The following is a list of steps that students can consider:  Clarify your academic and career interests; learn about opportunities in challenging fields, such as business, engineering, mathematics, and technology.  Develop self-determination, self-advocacy, and work-readiness skills.  Learn about rights to accommodations and how to determine appropriate academic and job accommodations.

Your Definitive Guide  Young bachelor's holders are hurting. But they're still doing better than high-school grads, and their crisis has been vastly overstated.

You hear from academics . And, most painfully, you hear it from the twenty-somethings who are shouldering a ruck sack of student debt through this frightening job market: A college degree just isn't worth what it used to be. In a lot of ways, the lament is true, especially when your point of reference is that frothy time of Spice Girls singles and signing bonuses otherwise known as the nineties tech boom. Like the rest of America's middle class, the gains college grads made during that amazing economic run have largely been erased by the last dozen or so wasted years. Yet, the college skeptics have a habit of overstating their case. A bachelor's degree in English is not, in fact, a ticket to working at a coffee shop, as Megan McArdle half-jokingly suggested last week. And while the stat's in wide circulation these days, half of all young college graduates are probably not jobless or toiling in menial jobs. So for the sake of clarity, consider this a guide to what we know -- both good and bad -- about the state of the job market for college grads. (1) They're Better Off Than High School Grads ... This part is basic, but can't be repeated enough: Bachelor's holders (in blue below) have about half the unemployment rate of high school graduates (in red below). BA's are still suffering from double the low rate of joblessness they enjoyed pre-recession. And yes, they're even worse off than they were during the tepid economies of the early nineties or pre-housing bubble oughts. But on the whole, you'd much rather have a degree in this job market than not. (2) ... But They're Still Hurting That's all bachelor's holders, though (or at least the ones over 25, who the Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely tracks). So what about young adults just off campus? The numbers aren't a nightmare, but they aren't especially pleasant either. Last month, the Bureau released a special report looking at Americans under 30 who'd earned a bachelor's in the past year, as of October of 2011. About 73 percent were employed (the paper didn't specify between full time and part-time). More than 11 percent were still looking for work. Without a doubt, graduates had it better twenty years ago. In 1994, about 87 percent of BA's were working either full or part-time a year after graduation, according to the Department of Education . About 8.4 percent were out of the labor force, in most cases because they'd returned to school. Just 4.4 percent were outright unemployed. It's safe to assume that the recent BLS figures have brightened up a bit over the course of our slow but steady jobs recovery. Yet any way you slice it, there are far more jobless college grads around than the United States is used to seeing. (3) Underemployment Has Grown... In the end, most sophisticated college critics aren't that worried about unemployment, though. Rather, they're worried about underemployment. There's a very loud chorus who believe that droves desperate BA's are strapping on barista aprons and answering phones as temps just to make ends meet, rather than starting stable professional careers. In the process, goes the argument, they're tragically pushing high school grads who would ordinarily fill those jobs even further down the economic food chain. The problem isn't imaginary. A few days back, the Wall Street Journal's Ben Casselman reported that 284,000 Americans with a BA or higher were working in jobs that paid minimum wage or less, about double the pre-recession total (as shown in the the paper's graph above). According to the BLS, the vast majority of those workers were actually in sub-minimum-wage jobs, meaning they were probably working for tips. The number of over-educated waiters and waitresses out there, in other words, has blown up quite a bit. (4) ... But by Less Than You Think That said, while the underemployment problem is real, it's also often over-hyped. Roughly a year ago, the Associated Press caused a stir when it reported that 53.6 percent of recent college graduates were either jobless, or working in a position that didn't require their skills -- a factlet that even made its way into the Presidential campaign when Mitt Romney repeated it (or something close). The article was based off a not-yet-public analysis by Northeastern University economist Andrew Sum. But this January, the Ohio University economist Richard Vedder and the Center for College Affordability and Productivity released their own report based on 2010 data arguing that, as shown in the graph below, "barely half of college graduates are in occupations requiring bachelor's degrees or more." That's all college graduates, by the way -- not just the hapless young ones.  If these numbers were accurate, they'd be a terrible indictment of the investment Americans have made in higher education. They'd suggest that the U.S. was suffering from a chronic case of degree inflation -- that employers, faced with a billowing supply of college bred talent, were demanding ever more elaborate educational credentials for low skill jobs simply because workers were desperate, and available. Thankfully, there's a strong argument that they're wrong -- or at least very misleading. The problem is that Vedder uses an extremely narrow definition of what qualifies as an appropriate job for a college graduate, based on occupational categories created by the BLS. The government's number crunchers try to classify jobs by the typical education level of entry-level workers within the field. But their results are often backward looking and out of step with the realities of the profession. Take nursing. According to the BLS, it's an associate's degree level job. But as the New York Times reported back in June , hundreds of hospitals around the country now are only hiring registered nurses with a bachelor's. As of 2008, 39 percent of new nurses had a four-year diploma. A classic case of degree inflation? Not necessarily. Professional groups argue that that nurses with more education are simply better at their jobs. Or consider police officers, who the BLS say only need a high school diploma, but about 30 percent of whom have a BA. If you were running a city, would want to hire someone with a degree in criminology to solve homicides or one day help manage the department? Or would you rather rely on someone who received most of their training on the job? It doesn't seem unreasonable to pick the former. As Stephen Rose and Anthony Carnevale of the Georgetown Center On Unemployment and the Workforce have argued, employers in these sorts of traditionally "middle-skill" fields are usually happy to pay a premium when they hire a college graduate (as shown below). This, they say, is evidence that degree inflation isn't really the problem. Rather, some jobs are simply becoming more complicated and skill intensive. Both the education needed to land them, and the pay they command, now reflect that. When researchers have used a more liberal -- and I'd argue modern -- definition of what makes a college-level job, they've predictably found that underemployment is less common. According to a January report by the Pew Charitable Trusts Economic Mobility Project, before the recession about 60 percent of working college graduates under the age of 25 were in occupations that matched their education, down about 2 percentage points from the pre-crash days (as shown below). Even the terrifying number that Romney cited was made out to be far worse by the media ( myself included, initially ) than it actually was. When the AP's report stated that more than half of young grads were either "jobless or underemployed" it happened to leave out a key detail: they were counting students who were back in school as "jobless." While some of those students may have gone for another degree out of desperation -- and perhaps unwisely at that -- enrolling in a graduate program isn't the same as regular old unemployment. In a telephone conversation, Northeastern's Sum told me that when divided up more precisely, his numbers looked extremely similar to Pew's.* Underemployment also tends to be temporary for college graduates. Even after the recession hit, Pew found that annually, about 27 percent of BA's stuck in high-school level jobs transitioned to college-level employment. Unfortunately, as Kevin Carey pointed out for The New Republic in 2011, journalists have a have a bad habit of projecting past trends far into the future. And so, as a result, nearly every downturn in the economy has yielded a thick crop of news stories questioning the long-term value of a college degree based on the short-term travails of young grads (as well as the observations of a few carefully chosen economists). Carey, for his part, found a sly way to send up the genre by tracking down a woman who'd been featured in one such 1982 Washington Post article. Then, just two years out of a Yale master's program, she was using her degrees in French and Arabic as...a bartender. Flash forward nearly three decades later, and she was working as a senior manager at USAID doing post-disaster development in...French speaking Madagascar. "That's how things usually work out for people who get college degrees," Carey wrote. (5) Don't Worry About College; Worry About the Economy But what if this time past really is prelude, and something fundamental has changed? What if the same way the economy evolved to make most middle-class manufacturing jobs a thing of memory, it's now shedding demand for educated workers? That was the provocative possibility suggested late last month in a working paper by a trio of Canadian economists, including the University of British Columbia's Paul Beaudry. Economists have long argued that the eighties and nineties were a period defined by what's called "skills-based technological change." The idea is that, with the first great wave of computerization, followed by the wildfire growth of the Internet, the job market stopped favoring brawn and started favoring brains. Employers went dashing after educated workers who could help them set up and use all the fabulous new tools available, and as a result, the demand for college graduates boomed, upending predictions dating back to the mid-seventies that there'd be a glut of bachelor's degree holders. Most economists tend to assume that this process continued into the oughts. And that's where Beaudry & Co. come in. Diving into the data, they argue that after around the year 2000, the demand for skills stopped growing, and actually reversed somewhat, even as the supply of college-educated young people kept piling up. Suddenly, campuses were producing more graduates than the market demanded leading to -- you guessed it -- the growth of underemployment. That change showed up in the job market in a few ways, they say. First, the amount of intellectual work involved in the average college grad's job -- as determined by worker surveys -- fell a few percentage points, back to the levels of the mid 1980s. Meanwhile, the ratio of college educated workers in management jobs to non-management jobs slumped back to its pre-tech-boom level. And, as many other researchers have noted, wages stagnated. Although illustrates changes to college grad pay with its own graphs, I'm borrowing a chart from the Economic Policy Institute that I actually think pictures the trend they discuss a bit more clearly . The reason this theory should scare college graduates -- and those who argue we need more of them -- is that it suggests their collective woes aren't a temporary product of the recession. Instead, it says the structure of the economy has changed. But as Beaudry told me in a conversation, he and his colleagues findings should be interpreted carefully. On the one hand, he said, they suggest that there may have been more demand for certain kinds of skills back when corporations were adapting to new technologies -- and needed people to help them through the process -- than there is today, when companies just need enough smart people to keep the ship running. On other, another great technological leap forward could revive corporate America's need for high-skill work. And in the meantime, he says, it's not as if the market has deteriorated completely. "This isn't saying all of a sudden it isn't worth going to college," he told me. "It's saying it's, at worst, as good as it was in the eighties." *** So where does this all leave us? In the short term, we're still obviously digging out of the jobs hole left by the recession. Unemployment for college graduates is higher than normal. Underemployment is more prevalent, though it's less severe than college critics portray, and perhaps no worse than during the Reagan days. It's the long view that's cloudier. Maybe, as the recession's impact fades, the economy will naturally go back to quickly churning out more jobs for high skill workers, and academics like Beaudry and his colleagues will be proven wrong. Or, perhaps they're right, and we'll need to wait for another great tech revolution before the market for educated workers goes back to growing the way it did 15 years ago. We can't say for sure. But we do know that young people are safer with a degree than without one. And if you're a wonk trying to figure out if we should be sending more or fewer students to college, the more important question might be whether we're rebuilding an economy with room for the grads who will be coming off of campus no matter what. ________________________________ * CORRECTION April 9: In an earlier version of this article, based largely on the AP's description of his analysis, I incorrectly lumped Sum's methodology in with Richard Vedder's. His methods, and results, are in fact closer to the Pew study I cite. Sum had not responded to a request for an interview before publication, but his office brought the issue to my attention today. Although the analysis for the AP still hasn't been released, he produced a similar report for the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.    Continue Reading                  George Frey / Reuters / Thanh Do / The Atlantic   The Family Trying to Escape Blame for the Opioid Crisis    David Armstrong      Relatives of the makers of OxyContin claim they have never benefited from money tied to the painkiller. A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

A recent report by the Associated Press found that one out of every two college graduates is either unemployed or underemployed, often working in a field that isn't related to their degree. This, along with the student loan debt topping $1 trillion , is causing graduates to find themselves with low-paying jobs that make them no better off than if they hadn't gone to college at all.  According to economists, college is still the best way to land the higher-paying jobs, but no longer is the act of attending college the key to success. Making the wrong decisions before entering college can hurt your chances of putting your degree to work later on.      It used to be OK to head to college now and figure out a degree later. According to MyMajor.com, 80% of students entering college hadn't picked a major and 50% will change their major while in college. With rising college tuition and students spending more time in college, they are amassing more debt which translates into higher payments upon graduation . Harvard economist Richard Freeman advises students who are undecided about their future plans to find a job after high school until they decide what they want to study instead of heading to college without a clear plan.

Don't Follow Your Passion   Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and star of the hit television series Shark Tank , advises people not to follow their passion. According to Cuban, we have a lot of passions in our life, but most won't translate into successful careers. Instead, he advises to follow our effort. Look at how you spend your time. Whatever you spend the most time doing may be your perfect career. When we spend time with something, we gain a lot of skill which makes us an expert in that field and being an expert translates to career success .          Create a Barrier   Pursuing a profession that requires a specialized degree creates a barrier to entry. Fields like medicine, education, law and accounting require that you have a degree in order to gain the certification needed to apply for those jobs. Other careers, like the arts, many business jobs and sports management, have collegiate degree programs, but they aren't required to work in the field making the amount of eligible people much higher.          Check BLS   The Bureau of Labor Statistics ' website has detailed information about most career paths including average salary and the amount of people needed in those careers in the future. If you're considering more than one degree path, choose one that will have a large need for workers in the future. Fields that have a saturated market not only make it harder to find a job, but the salary may also go down due to the oversupply of workers willing to work for less .          Reduce Your Debt   There are plenty of ways to reduce college debt . Go to a state college if appropriate for your field. You can live at home instead of paying the high price of campus housing, purchase used books, work a part time job if your degree program allows or take summer classes to reduce the amount of time you're in school.

A study released this month by the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows which recent grads found full-time jobs fast. (Shutterstock)      Finding work after graduation is a concern of almost every student – grad or undergrad or doctoral – in the final year of school. It’s a source of stress and excitement.  It turns out, unsurprisingly, that graduates with certain degrees are more successful finding a job right out of school than others. A study released this month by the National Association of Colleges and Employers ( NACE ), a Bethlehem, PA non-profit that links college career placement offices with employers, revealed which graduating bachelors degree students in the class of 2015 – by college major – were able to find employment within six months of graduation.  We folded NACE’s results into an easy-to-read gallery. Check it out below!            Gallery  Top 10 College Degrees For Getting Hired Right Out Of School   Launch Gallery  11 images       In putting together its study, NACE collected data on 373,807 undergrad students at various colleges throughout the country, with various majors, all graduating in 2015. It turns out that the field of study that led to the highest rate of employment within six months of graduation was computer sciences, with 72% of students majoring in the concentration finding a full-time job.    Those computer science students also reported an average starting salary of just over $69,000 a year—the highest starting salary tracked in NACE’s study. That’s an 11.3% increase in salary over numbers reported last year, according to NACE.  Number two on the list of majors that led to quick full-time employment was Business . NACE reported that 65.7% of the undergrad Business class of 2015 found work within six months, for an average salary of $51,452.   Overall – when looking at 2015 graduates – one of the more notable trends uncovered in this year’s study was the increase to the starting salaries of new grads, says Ed Koc, director of research for NACE. “The average starting salary went up between 4% and 5%,” he said. “That’s significant because salaries have been pretty flat for a number of years. They haven’t really exceeded the inflation rate for any period of time.”  Energy Jobs See Salary Dip  Employment was positive across the board, said Koc, but there were highlights, including STEM majors, who had the best rates of finding work fast. But that area of study is new to the top of the list. Over the past several years – up through the class of 2014 – three majors tended to have the best rate of employment: petroleum Engineering, Geo-sciences and chemistry—all fields of study connected to the oil and gas industry. That has shifted  “This year,” says Koc, “employment in engineering and engineering technology majors dropped. In addition, starting salaries dropped. Petroleum engineering, for the first time in nine years, is not the number one major when it comes to starting salary because the petroleum engineering starting salary for the class of 2015 dropped by 13%.”  Salaries connected to Geo-sciences fell by 25% and those of chemistry by 26%. “Cleary it’s a reflection of the problems that the energy industry is having right now, or had in the last year,” says Koc.  Grads Becoming Entrepreneurial  Also of note in the NACE report is the tendency of some new grads to seek less traditional employment options: freelancing, working contract-based gigs or becoming an entrepreneur. Computer science majors, which had the highest rate of employment this year, also saw a dip in their rate of standard employment by 1.2%. “Some of these individuals chose to be entrepreneurial,” says Koc.  The Humanities See An Upside  Computer sciences and other STEM-type majors may have come away with the highest rates of employment and salary, but the humanities saw some dramatic jumps of their own. The average starting salary for English majors rose 13.6% over last year, for example, and philosophy majors saw a 13.3% hike. History majors experienced a 14.3% salary rise and Language majors’ average salary shot up by 27.3%.  Why the humanities have enjoyed such a boost is still a mystery, says Koc, and more research and data are needed to understand the dynamics at play. “It was an overall better marketplace because salaries increased overall, but they’d been held down for quite some time,” Koc opined. “So it may be just some catching up that’s occurring there.”    Follow me on Twitter @KarstenStrauss Follow me on LinkedIn              Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                                                share        Trending         Leadership             Leadership    Nov 12, 2012 @ 06:05 PM           6 Things You Must Do To Get Your First Job After College                       Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google                 Susan Adams    ,     Forbes Staff                               Create a LinkedIn profile, do an internship, find a mentor and start networking by the time you are a freshman.      November may seem awfully early in the school year to be thinking about how you’re going to get a job when you graduate. But Dan Schawbel, Forbes contributor and founder of Millennial Branding, a one-man research and consulting firm that focuses on so-called Millennials or Generation Y, aged 18-29, the new generation of college students needs to get mobilized much earlier than spring of senior year. Schawbel, who is 29 and the author of a book about personal branding, Me 2.0: 4 Steps to Building Your Future , says students should take action as early as high school, if they are going to map out a promising track to getting a job straight out of college.  The majority of college students are not doing this. A new study Schawbel put together with college research website StudentAdvisor.com, underlines his contention.  I talked to Schawbel about the results of the study and asked him what students should be doing to set themselves up for jobs when they graduate. The study was relatively small—a survey of 200 students across the country taken in August 2012. But Schawbel says it’s borne out by his research among members of Generation Y. Here is his advice for students:    1. Create a LinkedIn profile .  Schawbel says young people should do this as early as their senior year in high school. Even if the profile is just a bare-bones list of where you attend high school, your extra-curricular activities, including awards or accolades, what you see as your skills, and a summary of the sort of career that may interest you, it’s a good idea to create this early. Do include jobs you’ve held, like working at a summer camp or babysitting; they show you’re enterprising and have shouldered responsibility. As you grow and accumulate more work experience, you can delete your early jobs and add new ones.  I’ll add one more LinkedIn strength: It can be extremely helpful to start building your list of connections early. Most adults you know have LinkedIn profiles with multiple contacts. Do connect to as many people as you can.   Schawbel says most students figure that because they already have a Facebook page, they are doing sufficient social networking. But most employers don’t troll Facebook looking for job candidates.  “It looks good if employers can find you on LinkedIn,” insists Schawbel, who predicts it will remain the pre-eminent professional social networking site in the foreseeable future. Among college students, the survey showed that only a third have a presence on LinkedIn. You will stand out from the competition if you create a LinkedIn account.  2. Establish a presence on WordPress or through your own blog.    According to the survey, only one in nine students has a presence on WordPress, which Schawbel says is the best site to put together a personal blog. He also advocates buying your own domain name through a service like GoDaddy.com, and then installing WordPress on the site you have created. What should young people blog about? If you don’t know what career path you want to pursue, pick a personal interest and write about that, whether it’s pop music or tennis or Model United Nations. It’s preferable if you can zero in on a professional topic like marketing, but if you can’t, do write about a subject that interests you.

Like establishing a LinkedIn profile and a blog, Schawbel believes it’s never too early to start interning.  According to the survey, students know that internships are valuable but they are failing to land them. Some 85% said they believed having an internship is either important or very important for their career and 52% said they hoped to have had three or more internships before graduating. But only 40% had done at least one internship thus far.  Schawbel says the best internships to get early on are with companies that have wide brand recognition. The summer of his junior year in college, Schawbel interned at Reebok. He is convinced that having the Reebok name on his résumé helped him land a marketing job at data storage company EMC the July following his graduation. “The reality is I did almost nothing at Reebok,” he says bluntly. “But brand names open doors.”  4. Get creative about finding a mentor.    Of the students surveyed, 70% said they had at least one mentor. Of that group, the greatest share, 37%, named their parent as their mentor, while 28% said they relied on a professor, 21% said they used a family or friend and 17% said their current or former employer was a mentor. Just 10% said they found a mentor through social networking. Schawbel understands why students turn to parents, family and friends, but he recommends making use of social networks. Unless your parents work in the field you want to pursue, they are not going to be able to help you most effectively.  “You’ve got to find someone who is doing what you want to do,” says Schawbel. He recommends doing an advanced search on LinkedIn for the company and field where you want to work. For instance, if you want to work in marketing and MTV is your dream employer, enter those two search terms and see who comes up. Or if you’re interested in human resources and you fantasize about working at Microsoft, search on those words. Send off emails to the people you find and ask if they will meet with you. To me this seems like a long shot but Schawbel observes that many adults perceive such an approach as impressive, and you only need one person to say yes. “If you get one mentor, it can change everything for you,” he notes.  I’ll add one suggestion to Schawbel’s: If you are directed enough to know the field and company where you want to work, ask your parent to do a search on their LinkedIn accounts. If you have a connection through your mom or dad, that can yield a fruitful way to approach someone.  5. Use your school’s career services office.    Though this seems like the most obvious way to get career help, the study reveals that only 29% of students use their college’s career office. In the best case scenario, the office will connect you with an alum who works in your field of interest who will help you get a job. Though career offices can also help with résumé and cover letter writing, and job interview preparations, the most powerful resource is the alumni database. At my alma mater, Brown University, there is an online alumni database, BRUnet, with more than 5,300 alumni registered who are willing to share their career experiences with Brown students or alumni. Other universities have similar resources. Take advantage of them.  6. Join a professional development or industry-specific group.    According to the study, only 22% of students belong to a professional development or industry-related group. This is another untapped resource. Most schools have college or university chapters of big professional groups. Some examples from Schawbel’s files: Boston University has a chapter of the American Marketing Association. The University of Illinois has a Finance Club and the University of Northern Iowa has an Accounting Club. These groups can connect you to established professionals in your area of interest. This is a great way to make mentoring connections and to form relationships that are likely to be helpful in the future.  Schawbel insists that the old-fashioned idea of spending your time at college exploring intellectual pursuits and putting off entry into the real world of work is no longer relevant. If you haven’t started networking, putting together a LinkedIn profile and doing internships in high school, you should start your freshman year.

Your article was successfully shared with the contacts you provided.         How valuable is a college education? Very valuable, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s latest report, “The Labor Market for Recent College Graduates.”  The unemployment rate and underemployment rate of recent college graduates, which it defines as graduates between 22 and 27, is substantially below that of non-graduates, and their wages are sharply higher.  According to the report, the unemployment rate for recent college graduates in September, its latest available data, was 4%, the lowest rate since October 2008, during the financial crisis. In addition, the jobless rate for college graduates was less than half that for all young workers — 8.8% — and below the rate for all workers, including college and non-college graduates, which was 4.8%.  The New York Fed also reported that over time college graduates have even better luck in the job market. All college graduates — defined as graduates from age 22 to 65 — had an unemployment rate of 2.6% and an underemployment rate — the percentage holding jobs that don’t require a college degree — of 34.3% in September, versus 44.2% for recent college graduates.  The relatively high underemployment rate probably reflects the larger share of job postings that don’t require a college education compared to those that do. According to the New York Fed, the index for non-college job postings in September (using a base of 100 for 1967) was 135 versus 108.9 for the index of college job postings.  Even when college graduates were employed in jobs that didn’t require a college degree, they tended not to work in low-wage jobs. Only 13.3% of recent college graduates were employed in low-wage jobs in September, while less than 8% of all college graduates employed in such jobs.  Recent college graduates also had substantially higher incomes than high school graduates: $43,000 compared with $26,000 for high school graduates as of January 2016, based on the latest New York Fed data.  Digging deeper, based on data for 2014-2015 that won’t be updated until early 2018, nine of the 10 top-paying jobs for college graduates early in their careers were in the field of engineering, with median wages ranging from $54,000 to $70,000. For mid-career jobs, defined as those aged 35 to 45, engineering accounted for eight of the 10 top-paying jobs, with median wages ranging from $85,000 to $110,000.  Education accounted for five of the 10 lowest paying jobs mid-career, with wages ranging from $39,000 to $47,000, but only one of the 10 lowest paying jobs for early careers.  Ironically, education jobs had the lowest unemployment and underemployment rates for college graduates early in their careers and mid-career.  — Related on ThinkAdvisor:   15 Best Paying Jobs for College Business Majors: 2016  16 Best & Worst 529 College Savings Plans of 2016: Morningstar  Rising Student Debt Among Seniors Threatens to Wreck Their Retirement  Graduate Students Receptive to Financial Advice, Despite Debt Load: Study    Load More       share on facebook  share on twitter        Bernice Napach           Bernice Napach is a senior writer at ThinkAdvisor covering financial markets and asset managers, robo-advisors, college planning and retirement issues.

The vast majority of U.S. college grads, they find, work in jobs that aren't strictly related to their degrees:      There are two different things going on in this chart. First, a significant number of college grads appear to be underemployed: In 2010, only 62 percent of U.S. college graduates had a job that required a college degree.  Second, the authors estimated that just 27 percent of college grads had a job that was closely related to their major. It's not clear that this is a big labor-market problem, though — it could just mean that many jobs don't really require a specific field of study. (You can find Abel and Dietz's longer paper here , and note that they are excluding people with graduate degrees in this second chart — so no doctors, lawyers, college professors, etc.)  There's an important twist here, too. The chances of finding a job related to your degree or major go up a few points if you move to a big city:      The authors' argument is that "big cities have more job openings and offer a wider variety of job opportunities that can potentially fit the skills of different workers." The odds of finding a match between college degree and job are about 6 percentage points higher in a place like New York City than in, say, Syracuse.  Of course, a key caveat here is that landing a job unrelated to your major isn't necessarily the end of the world. Indeed, it's the most common outcome by far. (My specific math degree doesn't really come in handy for journalism all that often, but college itself was still useful.)  The research does, however, hint at one possible advantage of large cities — and might help explain why workers in denser cities tend to be more productive . If there's a policy upshot here, it's that the broader economy could stand to benefit if large cities loosened up some of their restrictions on housing and made it easier for more people to live there — a point that writers like Matt Yglesias and Edward Glaeser have made over and over again.

Daniel Bortz, Monster contributor                    If you’re like many new college graduates, you feel a pit in your stomach just thinking about embarking on your very first job search . Well, cheer up, grads. Here’s how to get a good job out of college.  First thing you must know: There’s no substitute for elbow grease. “You get out what you put in,” says Robin Reshwan, founder of Collegial Services, a consulting and staffing firm based in Danville, California.  Follow these steps to launch your first job search and kick-start your career.  Tailor your resume for every application  Many employers today use applicant tracking systems to scan resumes for keywords. Meaning, if your resume doesn’t contain the right keywords , your application could get tossed out automatically.  To prevent that from happening, make tweaks to your resume to mirror the language that appears in the job posting, says Barbara Hewitt, associate director of Career Services at the University of Pennsylvania. (The same goes for the cover letter.)  If the job requirements include hard skills (e.g., JavaScript or Python for programmer positions), “make sure those terms are on your resume,” says Kelly Kennedy, a career counselor at the University of Virginia.  Cover your bases by checking out Monster’s resume critique checklist .  Check new jobs postings frequently  The best time to apply to a job is within the first 48 hours after it’s posted, so you’ll want to check for new job postings often. To get into a good routine, start off your day by searching for new job openings each morning. Monster’s job board enables you to search by job title, city, company, and skills; and to streamline the process, you can sign up to receive email alerts for new job postings.  Another way to get a line on job openings is to monitor prospective employers’ social media feeds to see if they plan on adding any positions in the near future.  Leverage your alumni network  To learn more about your industry or about a particular company, tap your college’s alumni network . Most colleges maintain an online alumni database that grads can use to get contact information, Hewitt says. In fact, some schools have already set up relationships with alumni, who are eager to offer job advice to new grads.  However, you need to be strategic about how you approach alumni. “Don’t hit up someone for a job right away,” Hewitt says. Instead, simply ask people to meet for coffee or chat on the phone, so you can learn more about what they do. (If the conversation goes well, the person may be willing to help you get a foot in the door.) If you’re making a cold introduction by email, try this template:  “Hi, my name is ­­­­_____, and I graduated with a degree in _____ from _____ university. I found your contact information through our alumni office. I’d love just 20 minutes of your time to hear more about what you do at ______ on a daily basis, your career path, and what it’s like to work in the field. I’ve attached a copy of my resume just so you have a frame of reference of my education and experience.”  Keep up with industry news  Even though you don’t have a job yet, you need to stay on top of what’s going on in your field. There are three basic things you should be doing to keep up with industry news:  1. Read trade publications and industry journals 2. Join professional social media groups 3. Follow social media feeds of companies and industry influencers  The news can clue you in to trends in hiring, companies on the rise, and companies going through rough patches.  You can also use informational interviews to expand your industry knowledge, says Steve Dalton, author of The 2-Hour Job Search: Using Technology to Get the Right Job Faster . “Ask people who are in the field, ‘What’s the most important 10 minutes of research you do each week to stay current with industry news?’” Dalton says.  Prepare for an interview even before you get the call  To actually snag a job offer, you obviously need to ace the interview itself. You’ll get a boost in confidence by preparing answers to common interview questions , such as “Where do you see yourself in five years?” and “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” Check out Monster’s list of 100 top job interview questions , and spend time developing your answers.  Then, you want to go into detective mode and learn more about hot topics in your industry as well as the company that’s interviewing you. “Make sure you thoroughly research the company, so you can answer basic questions,” Dalton says. “Most employers are going to ask things like, ‘What’s your favorite product that our firm sells?’ or ‘Who do you think is our biggest competitor?’ to see that you’ve done your homework.”  To gather information on potential employers, read the company’s website (specifically, the “press” section), follow them on social media, set up relevant Google alerts, and “look at their corporate reports if it’s a public company,” Hewitt says.  You can also get the inside scoop by checking out company profiles and employee reviews through Kununu to get a sense of culture, pay, and benefits.  Lastly, don’t discount the importance of a professional appearance. Appropriate interview attire , a mature voicemail greeting, and social media profiles that don’t throw up red flags are all must-haves. Leaving this stuff to the last minute is such a freshman move.

While a lucky few receive job offers at the end of their junior summer internships, the vast majority will begin their last semester of college without a post-graduation plan. According to a 2013 Accenture poll , only 39% of the classes of 2011 and 2012 had jobs lined up by the time they graduated; for 2013, just 16% had job offers a month before their commencement. Thanks to recent job gains and record highs in the stock market, however, those numbers have a good chance of turning around this year. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) 2014 Job Outlook Survey estimates that employers will hire approximately 8% more new college graduates in 2013-14 than they did in 2012-13. That's good news for the approximately 1.6 million students who will be entering the workforce with a Bachelor's degree this spring. But no matter how many new jobs the economy adds, it's up to seniors to go get them, says Diana Gruverman, director of Employer Services at New York University's Wasserman Center for Career Development. "The job's not going to come to you," she says. "You have to be proactive." Here are five ways to rev up your search and increase your chances of donning a cap and gown with a job offer in hand. 1. Forget landing your dream job. Focus on what can get you there in the future. While your first job can serve as a springboard for your professional future, it's not going to make or break your career, and it certainly won't be your last. "There is a fear in deciding what to pursue, and a fear that the choice will be right or wrong," says Lori Balantic, a senior associate director in Connecticut College's career counseling program. But choosing a first job isn't an indictment on your future, she says. Rather, it's a chance to explore a new field, build a network, and gain skills and insight that will serve you regardless of where your career path goes. For most Millennials, that path will be long and winding. "These days, college graduates are staying in their first job for 18 to 30 months and then moving on," notes Gruverman. Instead of searching for your dream job, "find something that will position you for your career goals," she advises. "Pick something interesting that will present you with challenges that will make you more marketable for your next job." 2. Map out each week of the semester, so you can visualize how you'll achieve your goal. "There are 13 to 15 academic weeks until graduation," says Balantic. Figure out what your goals are — be it a job offer, grad school, or a summer internship — and then make a week-by-week plan for achieving that goal. A sample plan may look something like this: Set up an appointment at Career Services. Make a list of your interests, skills, and desires for your first job (check out this article for good questions to ask yourself). Create or update your LinkedIn account, and check your social media profiles to make sure you aren't sending the wrong message to a potential employer. Update your resume. Join your college's alumni network and plan on attending a few upcoming events or panels. Talk to everyone you know about what you're thinking about, especially professors, parents or mentors who know you well. Reach out to three alumni in your field of interest and ask if you can take them out to coffee or set up a 30-minute phone call where they talk about their experience. Set aside a few hours each week to peruse job listings through your college's career services homepage, and make a list of everything that interests you, even if you're not qualified. Apply, apply, apply! Jumping headfirst into hundreds of job listings can be incredibly overwhelming and demotivating, so it's important to first think about who you are, what you're interested in, and what you're qualified for, so that you can tailor your job strategy to meet your unique goals and deadlines. 3. Make an appointment with Career Services — ASAP. For student job seekers, a visit to career services should be top priority. "College career centers are a wealth of information for students," says Gruverman. Some of the dozens of resources they provide include internal job boards, lists of alumni you can contact in a variety of fields, self-assessment tests, sample resumes and cover letters, and information about applying to grad school. The most valuable services they provide, however, are one-on-one meetings with career experts who can review your resume, conduct mock interviews, connect you to alumni, and help you practice your 90-second pitch. "Students should be able to talk about their experiences and skills, and why they would make a great candidate for a job in 90 seconds or less," says Gruverman. Whether you practice with a friend, a career counselor, or the mirror, the important thing is make sure you don't sound too robotic or rehearsed. "Practice will make networking feel a lot less awkward," she adds. 4. Network your heart out. "We encourage our students to think of everyone as a potential networking resource," says Gruverman. "Fellow students, peers, teachers, alumni. You never know where that conversation can take you." Balantic agrees. "I've noticed that students often neglect to mention what they are thinking about for post-BA with their most immediate network during the semester: their fellow students and professors," she says. This is a critical mistake. Networking is one of the most important things you can do to increase your chances of getting a job, and it will continue to be important throughout your career. While it may feel extremely uncomfortable to sell yourself as a potential candidate, remember that most people you speak to are eager to help students because they were once in your position themselves. (And don't worry — even people with years of practice think networking is awkward , so you're in good company.) The important thing is to make connections and keep in touch. It's good practice to send notes to people you meet at networking events, says Gruverman. "This gives you the chance to follow up again and it will make sure you're on their mind in case they see a job opportunity that they think you'd be good for." 5. Keep an open mind, and apply to everything. "The more applications you submit, the higher your response rate will be," says Gruverman. She recommends submitting 20 to 30 job applications a week, though your counselor may adjust that depending on the kinds of jobs you're applying to. Above all, keep an open mind. As Balantic says, there are no "right" or "wrong" jobs, only different kinds of experiences. Don't limit yourself to one company, one position, or even one industry, because you never know what opportunities you might miss by closing off your options too soon. In other words, "Make a plan from which to deviate." And don't forget to proofread!

You hear from academics . And, most painfully, you hear it from the twenty-somethings who are shouldering a ruck sack of student debt through this frightening job market: A college degree just isn't worth what it used to be. In a lot of ways, the lament is true, especially when your point of reference is that frothy time of Spice Girls singles and signing bonuses otherwise known as the nineties tech boom. Like the rest of America's middle class, the gains college grads made during that amazing economic run have largely been erased by the last dozen or so wasted years. Yet, the college skeptics have a habit of overstating their case. A bachelor's degree in English is not, in fact, a ticket to working at a coffee shop, as Megan McArdle half-jokingly suggested last week. And while the stat's in wide circulation these days, half of all young college graduates are probably not jobless or toiling in menial jobs. So for the sake of clarity, consider this a guide to what we know -- both good and bad -- about the state of the job market for college grads. (1) They're Better Off Than High School Grads ... This part is basic, but can't be repeated enough: Bachelor's holders (in blue below) have about half the unemployment rate of high school graduates (in red below). BA's are still suffering from double the low rate of joblessness they enjoyed pre-recession. And yes, they're even worse off than they were during the tepid economies of the early nineties or pre-housing bubble oughts. But on the whole, you'd much rather have a degree in this job market than not. (2) ... But They're Still Hurting That's all bachelor's holders, though (or at least the ones over 25, who the Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely tracks). So what about young adults just off campus? The numbers aren't a nightmare, but they aren't especially pleasant either. Last month, the Bureau released a special report looking at Americans under 30 who'd earned a bachelor's in the past year, as of October of 2011. About 73 percent were employed (the paper didn't specify between full time and part-time). More than 11 percent were still looking for work. Without a doubt, graduates had it better twenty years ago. In 1994, about 87 percent of BA's were working either full or part-time a year after graduation, according to the Department of Education . About 8.4 percent were out of the labor force, in most cases because they'd returned to school. Just 4.4 percent were outright unemployed. It's safe to assume that the recent BLS figures have brightened up a bit over the course of our slow but steady jobs recovery. Yet any way you slice it, there are far more jobless college grads around than the United States is used to seeing. (3) Underemployment Has Grown... In the end, most sophisticated college critics aren't that worried about unemployment, though. Rather, they're worried about underemployment. There's a very loud chorus who believe that droves desperate BA's are strapping on barista aprons and answering phones as temps just to make ends meet, rather than starting stable professional careers. In the process, goes the argument, they're tragically pushing high school grads who would ordinarily fill those jobs even further down the economic food chain. The problem isn't imaginary. A few days back, the Wall Street Journal's Ben Casselman reported that 284,000 Americans with a BA or higher were working in jobs that paid minimum wage or less, about double the pre-recession total (as shown in the the paper's graph above). According to the BLS, the vast majority of those workers were actually in sub-minimum-wage jobs, meaning they were probably working for tips. The number of over-educated waiters and waitresses out there, in other words, has blown up quite a bit. (4) ... But by Less Than You Think That said, while the underemployment problem is real, it's also often over-hyped. Roughly a year ago, the Associated Press caused a stir when it reported that 53.6 percent of recent college graduates were either jobless, or working in a position that didn't require their skills -- a factlet that even made its way into the Presidential campaign when Mitt Romney repeated it (or something close). The article was based off a not-yet-public analysis by Northeastern University economist Andrew Sum. But this January, the Ohio University economist Richard Vedder and the Center for College Affordability and Productivity released their own report based on 2010 data arguing that, as shown in the graph below, "barely half of college graduates are in occupations requiring bachelor's degrees or more." That's all college graduates, by the way -- not just the hapless young ones.  If these numbers were accurate, they'd be a terrible indictment of the investment Americans have made in higher education. They'd suggest that the U.S. was suffering from a chronic case of degree inflation -- that employers, faced with a billowing supply of college bred talent, were demanding ever more elaborate educational credentials for low skill jobs simply because workers were desperate, and available. Thankfully, there's a strong argument that they're wrong -- or at least very misleading. The problem is that Vedder uses an extremely narrow definition of what qualifies as an appropriate job for a college graduate, based on occupational categories created by the BLS. The government's number crunchers try to classify jobs by the typical education level of entry-level workers within the field. But their results are often backward looking and out of step with the realities of the profession. Take nursing. According to the BLS, it's an associate's degree level job. But as the New York Times reported back in June , hundreds of hospitals around the country now are only hiring registered nurses with a bachelor's. As of 2008, 39 percent of new nurses had a four-year diploma. A classic case of degree inflation? Not necessarily. Professional groups argue that that nurses with more education are simply better at their jobs. Or consider police officers, who the BLS say only need a high school diploma, but about 30 percent of whom have a BA. If you were running a city, would want to hire someone with a degree in criminology to solve homicides or one day help manage the department? Or would you rather rely on someone who received most of their training on the job? It doesn't seem unreasonable to pick the former. As Stephen Rose and Anthony Carnevale of the Georgetown Center On Unemployment and the Workforce have argued, employers in these sorts of traditionally "middle-skill" fields are usually happy to pay a premium when they hire a college graduate (as shown below). This, they say, is evidence that degree inflation isn't really the problem. Rather, some jobs are simply becoming more complicated and skill intensive. Both the education needed to land them, and the pay they command, now reflect that. When researchers have used a more liberal -- and I'd argue modern -- definition of what makes a college-level job, they've predictably found that underemployment is less common. According to a January report by the Pew Charitable Trusts Economic Mobility Project, before the recession about 60 percent of working college graduates under the age of 25 were in occupations that matched their education, down about 2 percentage points from the pre-crash days (as shown below). Even the terrifying number that Romney cited was made out to be far worse by the media ( myself included, initially ) than it actually was. When the AP's report stated that more than half of young grads were either "jobless or underemployed" it happened to leave out a key detail: they were counting students who were back in school as "jobless." While some of those students may have gone for another degree out of desperation -- and perhaps unwisely at that -- enrolling in a graduate program isn't the same as regular old unemployment. In a telephone conversation, Northeastern's Sum told me that when divided up more precisely, his numbers looked extremely similar to Pew's.* Underemployment also tends to be temporary for college graduates. Even after the recession hit, Pew found that annually, about 27 percent of BA's stuck in high-school level jobs transitioned to college-level employment. Unfortunately, as Kevin Carey pointed out for The New Republic in 2011, journalists have a have a bad habit of projecting past trends far into the future. And so, as a result, nearly every downturn in the economy has yielded a thick crop of news stories questioning the long-term value of a college degree based on the short-term travails of young grads (as well as the observations of a few carefully chosen economists). Carey, for his part, found a sly way to send up the genre by tracking down a woman who'd been featured in one such 1982 Washington Post article. Then, just two years out of a Yale master's program, she was using her degrees in French and Arabic as...a bartender. Flash forward nearly three decades later, and she was working as a senior manager at USAID doing post-disaster development in...French speaking Madagascar. "That's how things usually work out for people who get college degrees," Carey wrote. (5) Don't Worry About College; Worry About the Economy But what if this time past really is prelude, and something fundamental has changed? What if the same way the economy evolved to make most middle-class manufacturing jobs a thing of memory, it's now shedding demand for educated workers? That was the provocative possibility suggested late last month in a working paper by a trio of Canadian economists, including the University of British Columbia's Paul Beaudry. Economists have long argued that the eighties and nineties were a period defined by what's called "skills-based technological change." The idea is that, with the first great wave of computerization, followed by the wildfire growth of the Internet, the job market stopped favoring brawn and started favoring brains. Employers went dashing after educated workers who could help them set up and use all the fabulous new tools available, and as a result, the demand for college graduates boomed, upending predictions dating back to the mid-seventies that there'd be a glut of bachelor's degree holders. Most economists tend to assume that this process continued into the oughts. And that's where Beaudry & Co. come in. Diving into the data, they argue that after around the year 2000, the demand for skills stopped growing, and actually reversed somewhat, even as the supply of college-educated young people kept piling up. Suddenly, campuses were producing more graduates than the market demanded leading to -- you guessed it -- the growth of underemployment. That change showed up in the job market in a few ways, they say. First, the amount of intellectual work involved in the average college grad's job -- as determined by worker surveys -- fell a few percentage points, back to the levels of the mid 1980s. Meanwhile, the ratio of college educated workers in management jobs to non-management jobs slumped back to its pre-tech-boom level. And, as many other researchers have noted, wages stagnated. Although illustrates changes to college grad pay with its own graphs, I'm borrowing a chart from the Economic Policy Institute that I actually think pictures the trend they discuss a bit more clearly . The reason this theory should scare college graduates -- and those who argue we need more of them -- is that it suggests their collective woes aren't a temporary product of the recession. Instead, it says the structure of the economy has changed. But as Beaudry told me in a conversation, he and his colleagues findings should be interpreted carefully. On the one hand, he said, they suggest that there may have been more demand for certain kinds of skills back when corporations were adapting to new technologies -- and needed people to help them through the process -- than there is today, when companies just need enough smart people to keep the ship running. On other, another great technological leap forward could revive corporate America's need for high-skill work. And in the meantime, he says, it's not as if the market has deteriorated completely. "This isn't saying all of a sudden it isn't worth going to college," he told me. "It's saying it's, at worst, as good as it was in the eighties." *** So where does this all leave us? In the short term, we're still obviously digging out of the jobs hole left by the recession. Unemployment for college graduates is higher than normal. Underemployment is more prevalent, though it's less severe than college critics portray, and perhaps no worse than during the Reagan days. It's the long view that's cloudier. Maybe, as the recession's impact fades, the economy will naturally go back to quickly churning out more jobs for high skill workers, and academics like Beaudry and his colleagues will be proven wrong. Or, perhaps they're right, and we'll need to wait for another great tech revolution before the market for educated workers goes back to growing the way it did 15 years ago. We can't say for sure. But we do know that young people are safer with a degree than without one. And if you're a wonk trying to figure out if we should be sending more or fewer students to college, the more important question might be whether we're rebuilding an economy with room for the grads who will be coming off of campus no matter what. ________________________________ * CORRECTION April 9: In an earlier version of this article, based largely on the AP's description of his analysis, I incorrectly lumped Sum's methodology in with Richard Vedder's. His methods, and results, are in fact closer to the Pew study I cite. Sum had not responded to a request for an interview before publication, but his office brought the issue to my attention today. Although the analysis for the AP still hasn't been released, he produced a similar report for the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

A recent report by the Associated Press found that one out of every two college graduates is either unemployed or underemployed, often working in a field that isn't related to their degree. This, along with the student loan debt topping $1 trillion , is causing graduates to find themselves with low-paying jobs that make them no better off than if they hadn't gone to college at all.  According to economists, college is still the best way to land the higher-paying jobs, but no longer is the act of attending college the key to success. Making the wrong decisions before entering college can hurt your chances of putting your degree to work later on.      It used to be OK to head to college now and figure out a degree later. According to MyMajor.com, 80% of students entering college hadn't picked a major and 50% will change their major while in college. With rising college tuition and students spending more time in college, they are amassing more debt which translates into higher payments upon graduation . Harvard economist Richard Freeman advises students who are undecided about their future plans to find a job after high school until they decide what they want to study instead of heading to college without a clear plan.

Don't Follow Your Passion   Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and star of the hit television series Shark Tank , advises people not to follow their passion. According to Cuban, we have a lot of passions in our life, but most won't translate into successful careers. Instead, he advises to follow our effort. Look at how you spend your time. Whatever you spend the most time doing may be your perfect career. When we spend time with something, we gain a lot of skill which makes us an expert in that field and being an expert translates to career success .          Create a Barrier   Pursuing a profession that requires a specialized degree creates a barrier to entry. Fields like medicine, education, law and accounting require that you have a degree in order to gain the certification needed to apply for those jobs. Other careers, like the arts, many business jobs and sports management, have collegiate degree programs, but they aren't required to work in the field making the amount of eligible people much higher.          Check BLS   The Bureau of Labor Statistics ' website has detailed information about most career paths including average salary and the amount of people needed in those careers in the future. If you're considering more than one degree path, choose one that will have a large need for workers in the future. Fields that have a saturated market not only make it harder to find a job, but the salary may also go down due to the oversupply of workers willing to work for less .          Reduce Your Debt   There are plenty of ways to reduce college debt . Go to a state college if appropriate for your field. You can live at home instead of paying the high price of campus housing, purchase used books, work a part time job if your degree program allows or take summer classes to reduce the amount of time you're in school.

A study released this month by the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows which recent grads found full-time jobs fast. (Shutterstock)      Finding work after graduation is a concern of almost every student – grad or undergrad or doctoral – in the final year of school. It’s a source of stress and excitement.  It turns out, unsurprisingly, that graduates with certain degrees are more successful finding a job right out of school than others. A study released this month by the National Association of Colleges and Employers ( NACE ), a Bethlehem, PA non-profit that links college career placement offices with employers, revealed which graduating bachelors degree students in the class of 2015 – by college major – were able to find employment within six months of graduation.  We folded NACE’s results into an easy-to-read gallery. Check it out below!            Gallery  Top 10 College Degrees For Getting Hired Right Out Of School   Launch Gallery  11 images       In putting together its study, NACE collected data on 373,807 undergrad students at various colleges throughout the country, with various majors, all graduating in 2015. It turns out that the field of study that led to the highest rate of employment within six months of graduation was computer sciences, with 72% of students majoring in the concentration finding a full-time job.    Those computer science students also reported an average starting salary of just over $69,000 a year—the highest starting salary tracked in NACE’s study. That’s an 11.3% increase in salary over numbers reported last year, according to NACE.  Number two on the list of majors that led to quick full-time employment was Business . NACE reported that 65.7% of the undergrad Business class of 2015 found work within six months, for an average salary of $51,452.   Overall – when looking at 2015 graduates – one of the more notable trends uncovered in this year’s study was the increase to the starting salaries of new grads, says Ed Koc, director of research for NACE. “The average starting salary went up between 4% and 5%,” he said. “That’s significant because salaries have been pretty flat for a number of years. They haven’t really exceeded the inflation rate for any period of time.”  Energy Jobs See Salary Dip  Employment was positive across the board, said Koc, but there were highlights, including STEM majors, who had the best rates of finding work fast. But that area of study is new to the top of the list. Over the past several years – up through the class of 2014 – three majors tended to have the best rate of employment: petroleum Engineering, Geo-sciences and chemistry—all fields of study connected to the oil and gas industry. That has shifted  “This year,” says Koc, “employment in engineering and engineering technology majors dropped. In addition, starting salaries dropped. Petroleum engineering, for the first time in nine years, is not the number one major when it comes to starting salary because the petroleum engineering starting salary for the class of 2015 dropped by 13%.”  Salaries connected to Geo-sciences fell by 25% and those of chemistry by 26%. “Cleary it’s a reflection of the problems that the energy industry is having right now, or had in the last year,” says Koc.  Grads Becoming Entrepreneurial  Also of note in the NACE report is the tendency of some new grads to seek less traditional employment options: freelancing, working contract-based gigs or becoming an entrepreneur. Computer science majors, which had the highest rate of employment this year, also saw a dip in their rate of standard employment by 1.2%. “Some of these individuals chose to be entrepreneurial,” says Koc.  The Humanities See An Upside  Computer sciences and other STEM-type majors may have come away with the highest rates of employment and salary, but the humanities saw some dramatic jumps of their own. The average starting salary for English majors rose 13.6% over last year, for example, and philosophy majors saw a 13.3% hike. History majors experienced a 14.3% salary rise and Language majors’ average salary shot up by 27.3%.  Why the humanities have enjoyed such a boost is still a mystery, says Koc, and more research and data are needed to understand the dynamics at play. “It was an overall better marketplace because salaries increased overall, but they’d been held down for quite some time,” Koc opined. “So it may be just some catching up that’s occurring there.”   Follow me on Twitter @KarstenStrauss Follow me on LinkedIn     ABOUT THE AUTHOR        Karsten Strauss     Forbes Staff       Follow      I am a New York City-based journalist and staff writer for Forbes Magazine and Forbes.com covering leadership.

November may seem awfully early in the school year to be thinking about how you’re going to get a job when you graduate. But Dan Schawbel, Forbes contributor and founder of Millennial Branding, a one-man research and consulting firm that focuses on so-called Millennials or Generation Y, aged 18-29, the new generation of college students needs to get mobilized much earlier than spring of senior year. Schawbel, who is 29 and the author of a book about personal branding, Me 2.0: 4 Steps to Building Your Future , says students should take action as early as high school, if they are going to map out a promising track to getting a job straight out of college.  The majority of college students are not doing this. A new study Schawbel put together with college research website StudentAdvisor.com, underlines his contention.  I talked to Schawbel about the results of the study and asked him what students should be doing to set themselves up for jobs when they graduate. The study was relatively small—a survey of 200 students across the country taken in August 2012. But Schawbel says it’s borne out by his research among members of Generation Y. Here is his advice for students:    1. Create a LinkedIn profile .  Schawbel says young people should do this as early as their senior year in high school. Even if the profile is just a bare-bones list of where you attend high school, your extra-curricular activities, including awards or accolades, what you see as your skills, and a summary of the sort of career that may interest you, it’s a good idea to create this early. Do include jobs you’ve held, like working at a summer camp or babysitting; they show you’re enterprising and have shouldered responsibility. As you grow and accumulate more work experience, you can delete your early jobs and add new ones.  I’ll add one more LinkedIn strength: It can be extremely helpful to start building your list of connections early. Most adults you know have LinkedIn profiles with multiple contacts. Do connect to as many people as you can.   Schawbel says most students figure that because they already have a Facebook page, they are doing sufficient social networking. But most employers don’t troll Facebook looking for job candidates.  “It looks good if employers can find you on LinkedIn,” insists Schawbel, who predicts it will remain the pre-eminent professional social networking site in the foreseeable future. Among college students, the survey showed that only a third have a presence on LinkedIn. You will stand out from the competition if you create a LinkedIn account.  2. Establish a presence on WordPress or through your own blog.    According to the survey, only one in nine students has a presence on WordPress, which Schawbel says is the best site to put together a personal blog. He also advocates buying your own domain name through a service like GoDaddy.com, and then installing WordPress on the site you have created. What should young people blog about? If you don’t know what career path you want to pursue, pick a personal interest and write about that, whether it’s pop music or tennis or Model United Nations. It’s preferable if you can zero in on a professional topic like marketing, but if you can’t, do write about a subject that interests you.

Like establishing a LinkedIn profile and a blog, Schawbel believes it’s never too early to start interning.  According to the survey, students know that internships are valuable but they are failing to land them. Some 85% said they believed having an internship is either important or very important for their career and 52% said they hoped to have had three or more internships before graduating. But only 40% had done at least one internship thus far.  Schawbel says the best internships to get early on are with companies that have wide brand recognition. The summer of his junior year in college, Schawbel interned at Reebok. He is convinced that having the Reebok name on his résumé helped him land a marketing job at data storage company EMC the July following his graduation. “The reality is I did almost nothing at Reebok,” he says bluntly. “But brand names open doors.”  4. Get creative about finding a mentor.    Of the students surveyed, 70% said they had at least one mentor. Of that group, the greatest share, 37%, named their parent as their mentor, while 28% said they relied on a professor, 21% said they used a family or friend and 17% said their current or former employer was a mentor. Just 10% said they found a mentor through social networking. Schawbel understands why students turn to parents, family and friends, but he recommends making use of social networks. Unless your parents work in the field you want to pursue, they are not going to be able to help you most effectively.  “You’ve got to find someone who is doing what you want to do,” says Schawbel. He recommends doing an advanced search on LinkedIn for the company and field where you want to work. For instance, if you want to work in marketing and MTV is your dream employer, enter those two search terms and see who comes up. Or if you’re interested in human resources and you fantasize about working at Microsoft, search on those words. Send off emails to the people you find and ask if they will meet with you. To me this seems like a long shot but Schawbel observes that many adults perceive such an approach as impressive, and you only need one person to say yes. “If you get one mentor, it can change everything for you,” he notes.  I’ll add one suggestion to Schawbel’s: If you are directed enough to know the field and company where you want to work, ask your parent to do a search on their LinkedIn accounts. If you have a connection through your mom or dad, that can yield a fruitful way to approach someone.  5. Use your school’s career services office.    Though this seems like the most obvious way to get career help, the study reveals that only 29% of students use their college’s career office. In the best case scenario, the office will connect you with an alum who works in your field of interest who will help you get a job. Though career offices can also help with résumé and cover letter writing, and job interview preparations, the most powerful resource is the alumni database. At my alma mater, Brown University, there is an online alumni database, BRUnet, with more than 5,300 alumni registered who are willing to share their career experiences with Brown students or alumni. Other universities have similar resources. Take advantage of them.  6. Join a professional development or industry-specific group.    According to the study, only 22% of students belong to a professional development or industry-related group. This is another untapped resource. Most schools have college or university chapters of big professional groups. Some examples from Schawbel’s files: Boston University has a chapter of the American Marketing Association. The University of Illinois has a Finance Club and the University of Northern Iowa has an Accounting Club. These groups can connect you to established professionals in your area of interest. This is a great way to make mentoring connections and to form relationships that are likely to be helpful in the future.  Schawbel insists that the old-fashioned idea of spending your time at college exploring intellectual pursuits and putting off entry into the real world of work is no longer relevant. If you haven’t started networking, putting together a LinkedIn profile and doing internships in high school, you should start your freshman year. Don’t put it off, he admonishes: “The longer you wait, the worse off you are.”                 Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                                       Menu   Search             ThinkAdvisor  An ALM Exclusive Brand           Sign In    Register       Home  Investment Portfolio   Investment Portfolio  ETFs  SmartBeta  ESG Investing  Mutual Funds  Fixed Income & Bond Markets  Alternative Investments  Economy & Markets  Investing Theory & Strategy  College Planning  Behavioral Finance  Portfolio Construction   Wealth Management   Wealth Management  Wealth Manager News & Advice  Family Office News & Advice  Tax Planning & Strategies  Estate Planning Guides & News  Charitable Investing  Risk Management   Retirement Planning   Retirement Planning  Annuity Planning  Income Planning  Life Planning & LTC  Retirement Planning  Defined Contribution Plans   Life/Health Insurance   Life/Health Insurance  Life Insurance Strategies  Health Insurance  Annuities  Your Practice  Resource Center   Practice Management   Practice Management  RIA News  Independent Broker-Dealers  Wirehouse Brokers  NextGen Advisor  NextGen Investor  Career News & Advice  Client News & Advice  Legal & Compliance   TechCenter   TechCenter  FinTech  CyberSecurity  Advisor 2.0  Marketing & Technology  RegTech   Magazine Archives   Research on Wealth  Investment Advisor   Resources  Instant Insights  Events  Editorial Calendar  Resource Center  Newsletters  Webcasts  About Us  Contact Us  Site Map  Advertise With Us  Terms of Service  Privacy Policy   Follow  ThinkAdvisor       Copyright © 2018 ALM Media Properties, LLC.

Your article was successfully shared with the contacts you provided.         How valuable is a college education? Very valuable, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s latest report, “The Labor Market for Recent College Graduates.”  The unemployment rate and underemployment rate of recent college graduates, which it defines as graduates between 22 and 27, is substantially below that of non-graduates, and their wages are sharply higher.  According to the report, the unemployment rate for recent college graduates in September, its latest available data, was 4%, the lowest rate since October 2008, during the financial crisis. In addition, the jobless rate for college graduates was less than half that for all young workers — 8.8% — and below the rate for all workers, including college and non-college graduates, which was 4.8%.  The New York Fed also reported that over time college graduates have even better luck in the job market. All college graduates — defined as graduates from age 22 to 65 — had an unemployment rate of 2.6% and an underemployment rate — the percentage holding jobs that don’t require a college degree — of 34.3% in September, versus 44.2% for recent college graduates.  The relatively high underemployment rate probably reflects the larger share of job postings that don’t require a college education compared to those that do. According to the New York Fed, the index for non-college job postings in September (using a base of 100 for 1967) was 135 versus 108.9 for the index of college job postings.  Even when college graduates were employed in jobs that didn’t require a college degree, they tended not to work in low-wage jobs. Only 13.3% of recent college graduates were employed in low-wage jobs in September, while less than 8% of all college graduates employed in such jobs.  Recent college graduates also had substantially higher incomes than high school graduates: $43,000 compared with $26,000 for high school graduates as of January 2016, based on the latest New York Fed data.  Digging deeper, based on data for 2014-2015 that won’t be updated until early 2018, nine of the 10 top-paying jobs for college graduates early in their careers were in the field of engineering, with median wages ranging from $54,000 to $70,000. For mid-career jobs, defined as those aged 35 to 45, engineering accounted for eight of the 10 top-paying jobs, with median wages ranging from $85,000 to $110,000.  Education accounted for five of the 10 lowest paying jobs mid-career, with wages ranging from $39,000 to $47,000, but only one of the 10 lowest paying jobs for early careers.  Ironically, education jobs had the lowest unemployment and underemployment rates for college graduates early in their careers and mid-career.  — Related on ThinkAdvisor:   15 Best Paying Jobs for College Business Majors: 2016  16 Best & Worst 529 College Savings Plans of 2016: Morningstar  Rising Student Debt Among Seniors Threatens to Wreck Their Retirement  Graduate Students Receptive to Financial Advice, Despite Debt Load: Study    Load More       share on facebook  share on twitter        Bernice Napach           Bernice Napach is a senior writer at ThinkAdvisor covering financial markets and asset managers, robo-advisors, college planning and retirement issues.

The vast majority of U.S. college grads, they find, work in jobs that aren't strictly related to their degrees:      There are two different things going on in this chart. First, a significant number of college grads appear to be underemployed: In 2010, only 62 percent of U.S. college graduates had a job that required a college degree.  Second, the authors estimated that just 27 percent of college grads had a job that was closely related to their major. It's not clear that this is a big labor-market problem, though — it could just mean that many jobs don't really require a specific field of study. (You can find Abel and Dietz's longer paper here , and note that they are excluding people with graduate degrees in this second chart — so no doctors, lawyers, college professors, etc.)  There's an important twist here, too. The chances of finding a job related to your degree or major go up a few points if you move to a big city:      The authors' argument is that "big cities have more job openings and offer a wider variety of job opportunities that can potentially fit the skills of different workers." The odds of finding a match between college degree and job are about 6 percentage points higher in a place like New York City than in, say, Syracuse.  Of course, a key caveat here is that landing a job unrelated to your major isn't necessarily the end of the world. Indeed, it's the most common outcome by far. (My specific math degree doesn't really come in handy for journalism all that often, but college itself was still useful.)  The research does, however, hint at one possible advantage of large cities — and might help explain why workers in denser cities tend to be more productive . If there's a policy upshot here, it's that the broader economy could stand to benefit if large cities loosened up some of their restrictions on housing and made it easier for more people to live there — a point that writers like Matt Yglesias and Edward Glaeser have made over and over again.

Daniel Bortz, Monster contributor                    If you’re like many new college graduates, you feel a pit in your stomach just thinking about embarking on your very first job search . Well, cheer up, grads. Here’s how to get a good job out of college.  First thing you must know: There’s no substitute for elbow grease. “You get out what you put in,” says Robin Reshwan, founder of Collegial Services, a consulting and staffing firm based in Danville, California.  Follow these steps to launch your first job search and kick-start your career.  Tailor your resume for every application  Many employers today use applicant tracking systems to scan resumes for keywords. Meaning, if your resume doesn’t contain the right keywords , your application could get tossed out automatically.  To prevent that from happening, make tweaks to your resume to mirror the language that appears in the job posting, says Barbara Hewitt, associate director of Career Services at the University of Pennsylvania. (The same goes for the cover letter.)  If the job requirements include hard skills (e.g., JavaScript or Python for programmer positions), “make sure those terms are on your resume,” says Kelly Kennedy, a career counselor at the University of Virginia.  Cover your bases by checking out Monster’s resume critique checklist .  Check new jobs postings frequently  The best time to apply to a job is within the first 48 hours after it’s posted, so you’ll want to check for new job postings often. To get into a good routine, start off your day by searching for new job openings each morning. Monster’s job board enables you to search by job title, city, company, and skills; and to streamline the process, you can sign up to receive email alerts for new job postings.  Another way to get a line on job openings is to monitor prospective employers’ social media feeds to see if they plan on adding any positions in the near future.  Leverage your alumni network  To learn more about your industry or about a particular company, tap your college’s alumni network . Most colleges maintain an online alumni database that grads can use to get contact information, Hewitt says. In fact, some schools have already set up relationships with alumni, who are eager to offer job advice to new grads.  However, you need to be strategic about how you approach alumni. “Don’t hit up someone for a job right away,” Hewitt says. Instead, simply ask people to meet for coffee or chat on the phone, so you can learn more about what they do. (If the conversation goes well, the person may be willing to help you get a foot in the door.) If you’re making a cold introduction by email, try this template:  “Hi, my name is ­­­­_____, and I graduated with a degree in _____ from _____ university. I found your contact information through our alumni office. I’d love just 20 minutes of your time to hear more about what you do at ______ on a daily basis, your career path, and what it’s like to work in the field. I’ve attached a copy of my resume just so you have a frame of reference of my education and experience.”  Keep up with industry news  Even though you don’t have a job yet, you need to stay on top of what’s going on in your field. There are three basic things you should be doing to keep up with industry news:  1. Read trade publications and industry journals 2. Join professional social media groups 3. Follow social media feeds of companies and industry influencers  The news can clue you in to trends in hiring, companies on the rise, and companies going through rough patches.  You can also use informational interviews to expand your industry knowledge, says Steve Dalton, author of The 2-Hour Job Search: Using Technology to Get the Right Job Faster . “Ask people who are in the field, ‘What’s the most important 10 minutes of research you do each week to stay current with industry news?’” Dalton says.  Prepare for an interview even before you get the call  To actually snag a job offer, you obviously need to ace the interview itself. You’ll get a boost in confidence by preparing answers to common interview questions , such as “Where do you see yourself in five years?” and “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” Check out Monster’s list of 100 top job interview questions , and spend time developing your answers.  Then, you want to go into detective mode and learn more about hot topics in your industry as well as the company that’s interviewing you. “Make sure you thoroughly research the company, so you can answer basic questions,” Dalton says. “Most employers are going to ask things like, ‘What’s your favorite product that our firm sells?’ or ‘Who do you think is our biggest competitor?’ to see that you’ve done your homework.”  To gather information on potential employers, read the company’s website (specifically, the “press” section), follow them on social media, set up relevant Google alerts, and “look at their corporate reports if it’s a public company,” Hewitt says.  You can also get the inside scoop by checking out company profiles and employee reviews through Kununu to get a sense of culture, pay, and benefits.  Lastly, don’t discount the importance of a professional appearance. Appropriate interview attire , a mature voicemail greeting, and social media profiles that don’t throw up red flags are all must-haves. Leaving this stuff to the last minute is such a freshman move.

While a lucky few receive job offers at the end of their junior summer internships, the vast majority will begin their last semester of college without a post-graduation plan. According to a 2013 Accenture poll , only 39% of the classes of 2011 and 2012 had jobs lined up by the time they graduated; for 2013, just 16% had job offers a month before their commencement. Thanks to recent job gains and record highs in the stock market, however, those numbers have a good chance of turning around this year. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) 2014 Job Outlook Survey estimates that employers will hire approximately 8% more new college graduates in 2013-14 than they did in 2012-13. That's good news for the approximately 1.6 million students who will be entering the workforce with a Bachelor's degree this spring. But no matter how many new jobs the economy adds, it's up to seniors to go get them, says Diana Gruverman, director of Employer Services at New York University's Wasserman Center for Career Development. "The job's not going to come to you," she says. "You have to be proactive." Here are five ways to rev up your search and increase your chances of donning a cap and gown with a job offer in hand. 1. Forget landing your dream job. Focus on what can get you there in the future. While your first job can serve as a springboard for your professional future, it's not going to make or break your career, and it certainly won't be your last. "There is a fear in deciding what to pursue, and a fear that the choice will be right or wrong," says Lori Balantic, a senior associate director in Connecticut College's career counseling program. But choosing a first job isn't an indictment on your future, she says. Rather, it's a chance to explore a new field, build a network, and gain skills and insight that will serve you regardless of where your career path goes. For most Millennials, that path will be long and winding. "These days, college graduates are staying in their first job for 18 to 30 months and then moving on," notes Gruverman. Instead of searching for your dream job, "find something that will position you for your career goals," she advises. "Pick something interesting that will present you with challenges that will make you more marketable for your next job." 2. Map out each week of the semester, so you can visualize how you'll achieve your goal. "There are 13 to 15 academic weeks until graduation," says Balantic. Figure out what your goals are — be it a job offer, grad school, or a summer internship — and then make a week-by-week plan for achieving that goal. A sample plan may look something like this: Set up an appointment at Career Services. Make a list of your interests, skills, and desires for your first job (check out this article for good questions to ask yourself). Create or update your LinkedIn account, and check your social media profiles to make sure you aren't sending the wrong message to a potential employer. Update your resume. Join your college's alumni network and plan on attending a few upcoming events or panels. Talk to everyone you know about what you're thinking about, especially professors, parents or mentors who know you well. Reach out to three alumni in your field of interest and ask if you can take them out to coffee or set up a 30-minute phone call where they talk about their experience. Set aside a few hours each week to peruse job listings through your college's career services homepage, and make a list of everything that interests you, even if you're not qualified. Apply, apply, apply! Jumping headfirst into hundreds of job listings can be incredibly overwhelming and demotivating, so it's important to first think about who you are, what you're interested in, and what you're qualified for, so that you can tailor your job strategy to meet your unique goals and deadlines. 3. Make an appointment with Career Services — ASAP. For student job seekers, a visit to career services should be top priority. "College career centers are a wealth of information for students," says Gruverman. Some of the dozens of resources they provide include internal job boards, lists of alumni you can contact in a variety of fields, self-assessment tests, sample resumes and cover letters, and information about applying to grad school. The most valuable services they provide, however, are one-on-one meetings with career experts who can review your resume, conduct mock interviews, connect you to alumni, and help you practice your 90-second pitch. "Students should be able to talk about their experiences and skills, and why they would make a great candidate for a job in 90 seconds or less," says Gruverman. Whether you practice with a friend, a career counselor, or the mirror, the important thing is make sure you don't sound too robotic or rehearsed. "Practice will make networking feel a lot less awkward," she adds. 4. Network your heart out. "We encourage our students to think of everyone as a potential networking resource," says Gruverman. "Fellow students, peers, teachers, alumni. You never know where that conversation can take you." Balantic agrees. "I've noticed that students often neglect to mention what they are thinking about for post-BA with their most immediate network during the semester: their fellow students and professors," she says. This is a critical mistake. Networking is one of the most important things you can do to increase your chances of getting a job, and it will continue to be important throughout your career. While it may feel extremely uncomfortable to sell yourself as a potential candidate, remember that most people you speak to are eager to help students because they were once in your position themselves. (And don't worry — even people with years of practice think networking is awkward , so you're in good company.) The important thing is to make connections and keep in touch. It's good practice to send notes to people you meet at networking events, says Gruverman. "This gives you the chance to follow up again and it will make sure you're on their mind in case they see a job opportunity that they think you'd be good for." 5. Keep an open mind, and apply to everything. "The more applications you submit, the higher your response rate will be," says Gruverman. She recommends submitting 20 to 30 job applications a week, though your counselor may adjust that depending on the kinds of jobs you're applying to. Above all, keep an open mind. As Balantic says, there are no "right" or "wrong" jobs, only different kinds of experiences. Don't limit yourself to one company, one position, or even one industry, because you never know what opportunities you might miss by closing off your options too soon. In other words, "Make a plan from which to deviate." And don't forget to proofread!
