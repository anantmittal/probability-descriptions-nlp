After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Twins          Back to Twins           English   Español       My son is going to have twins. I'm a fraternal twin and I have another brother and sister that are fraternal twins. My husband has on his side of the family twins (fraternal) and triplets - boys. Is our son having twins because of our background? Does it have to do with our genetics?        -A curious adult   June 25, 2014  That is a very interesting question! And one that many people wonder about. In fact, we answered a very similar question many years ago.  Twin genetics depend on what kind of twins we are talking about. Having identical twins is not genetic. On the other hand, fraternal twins can run in families.  Genetics can definitely play a role in having fraternal twins. For example, a woman that has a sibling that is a fraternal twin is 2.5 times more likely to have twins than average!  However, for a given pregnancy, only the mother’s genetics matter. Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are simultaneously fertilized instead of just one. A father’s genes can’t make a woman release two eggs.  It sounds like fraternal twins do indeed run in your family! But, since your son is the father, his genes are on the wrong side of the family tree. So, your family history likely didn’t play a role in his wife’s twin pregnancy.  The answer would be different if you were asking about a daughter. Also, although your son’s family history of twins can’t increase his wife’s chance of having twins, he can pass those genes down to your granddaughter. With your strong family history of fraternal twins, this just might increase the chances of your granddaughter having twins!  But, your daughter-in-law is not necessarily having twins because of her genetics. Other things like environment, nutrition, age, and weight have also been linked to having twins as well.  And there is always simple chance…every woman has a chance at having fraternal twins.  It is just that some women have a higher or lower chance.   Huh? Help Me Understand the Genetics!  Wait a minute. One type of twins has a genetic basis and the other does not? And, only the mom’s genetics matter? How is that possible?  Don’t worry. It makes a lot of sense once we break down the biology.  The important difference between identical and fraternal twins is the number of fertilized eggs involved. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg. Fraternal twins come from two different ones.  Identical twins happen when a single embryo splits in two soon after fertilization. This is why identical twins have identical DNA. They came from the same fertilized egg.  Since embryo splitting is a random event that happens by chance, it doesn’t run in families. Genes are not involved. The same is not true for fraternal twins.  Fraternal twins happen when two independent eggs are each fertilized by different sperm.  This is why the DNA of fraternal twins is different. In fact, fhe DNA of fraternal twins is no more similar than the DNA any other sibling pair.  Usually, a woman only releases a single egg at a time. Fraternal twins can only happen if a mother releases two eggs in one cycle. This is called hyperovulation.  Unlike embryo splitting, ovulation is a normal biological process that is controlled by our genes. And, different women can have different versions of these ovulation genes.  Some women have versions (called alleles) of these genes that make them more likely to hyperovulate. This means there is a higher chance that two eggs could get fertilized at once, leading to fraternal twins.  The gene versions that increase the chance of hyperovulation can be passed down from parent to child. This is why fraternal twins run in families.  However, only women ovulate. So, the mother’s genes control this and the fathers don’t.  This is why having a background of twins in the family matters only if it is on the mother’s side. And why your son’s family genetics did not play a role in his twins.  We went over a lot of this stuff in our previous answer, but your question got me thinking. Our last answer on twins was done so long ago. Has recent research discovered anything new on this fascinating topic? They have indeed… at least if you are a sheep!   Counting Sheep can Teach us about Twins  Scientists often turn to animals when they want to study a biological process. Some of the newest information we have about twin genetics comes from studying sheep.  Sheep were chosen because, like people, they typically give birth to a single lamb. However, they can sometimes have twins and triplets.  Different breeds of sheep naturally have higher or lower twin rates.  These different breeds have different versions (called alleles) of some of their genes. Specific alleles can make certain breeds more likely to have twins.  We can compare the genes between these different breeds to try to find the genes controlling twinning. And, this is just what scientists did.  A thorough search for genes controlling twining in sheep identified several interesting ones. The breeds with higher twin rates had different alleles of these genes!  Three key sheep genes identified were named BMP15, GDF9, and BMPR1B. The specific gene names are not really important. Just know that all of these genes are involved in controlling ovulation. Which makes sense!  Remember, hyperovulation increases the chance of having fraternal twins. The sheep breeds with higher than average twin rates had versions of the genes that increase ovulation.  Sheep are a great tool to help us study twin genetics. The tricky part is connecting these findings to people.  It is harder to study humans. Scientists have tried to find links between the genes identified in sheep and human twin genetics. So far they’ve found that some match up and some don’t. This, in and of itself, is interesting!  Another gene called follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH for short, has also been linked to twins in humans. Like the other three genes identified, this FSH is also involved in promoting ovulation, and mothers of fraternal twins often have high levels of it.  It seems that twin genetics is more complicated in humans than in sheep. More genes are likely involved. But, each new bit of information about the genes involved adds another puzzle piece to the complete genetic picture.  Maybe someday we will know all the genes that cause fraternal twins in people.  But for now, you can just tell your son that his genetics likely didn’t cause his twins. Scientists are still trying to figure out which, if any, genes on his wife’s side could possibly be the culprits!

By Stephanie / 5						COMMENTS  111 Shares    Most moms consider themselves lucky enough to have one set of twins, but if you’re incredibly lucky, then you might even end up with two pairs of twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice?    What are the chances of having twins? The birth rate for twins is only going up, rising by as much as 76% in the last 30 years. That means that your chance of having twins in the USA is as high as 3 in 100 births. But that’s fraternal twins. The chance of identical twins is the same as it’s always been, which is around 3 in 1000 babies born as identical twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice? Obviously, the chance of having two sets of twins is pretty rare, but it’s not as rare as you might think. If you’re looking for two sets of twins of any type, the chance of that is around 1 in 3,000, which is the same chance as getting struck by lightning during your life!   A set of identical twins and fraternal twins is only around 1 in 10,000, or the same odds that you’re going to fall off your toilet and end up in hospital! Having two sets of identical twins is pretty damn unlikely, with only 1 chance in 70,000. Bear in mind that if you’ve already got one set of twins, you might actually be more likely to have a second set, because of all of the things that increase your chances of twin births. Things like: Having already been pregnant before. Women who have already had a baby, including women who have already had twins, are more likely to have twins in the future! Getting older. Women over the age of around 35 have more twins in general, because in the few years before you hit peri-menopause, your ovaries start to release more than one egg at a time. Having some sort of fertility treatment, like IVF or fertility drugs. These sort of things can stimulate your body to produce multiple eggs over and over. Coming from a family with twins in it. There’s some sort of genetic component to twins, and if twins run in your family, then you’re more likely to have them. This also means that if you’ve had twins once, they might run in your family and you might have them again! Being on the pill, or just coming off of the pill. Apparently, the hormonal changes that the pill causes in women can increase their chances of having twins. Being taller or heavier than average. Taller and heavier women have a greater than normal chance of having twins . But remember to stay healthy! Make sure your partner has a lot of zinc in his diet. Zinc contributes to healthy sperm, and the healthier your partner’s sperm, the more you have of chance of conceiving twins! Twins are getting more and more common, so if you have one set of twins and you’re going for another, you might just get lucky! How do you think you would cope with two sets of twins? Do you know anyone who actually has two sets of twins? Or maybe you’re one of the incredibly fortunate women who beat the odds and has an awesome foursome! Let us know in the comments below!        Nicole  says: October 25, 2017 at 10:20 pm I actually know 2 people within 30 mins of each other who have 2 pairs of twins! Reply   Deidre Turner  says: November 17, 2017 at 5:01 am Me! I’m 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins (both di/di). My first set were conceived with the assistance of fertility treatment (IUI), then I had a singleton conceived naturally and I’m pregnant with twins again, conceived naturally this time. I’m not particularly tall or big, I’m under 35 (currently 34 and was 29 having my first set), I haven’t been on the pill for years and hubby’s sperm counts are ok but not great. I’ve only been pregnant 3 times. I was on only 25mg (half a tablet) of clomid for 4 cycles over 5 years ago so that’s all the fertility drugs I ever took. It explains the first set but not the second set. I think that family history is my biggest influence; my nanna had 2 sets of twins and a set of triplets; my mum is one of the triplets. I’m the only one in my large extended family who has had any multiples at all so it looks like the twin gene skipped straight to me! Reply   Katie Hopkins  says: February 28, 2018 at 7:51 am I’m 24 years old and pregnant with my second set of twins. No fertility treatments or help . My first set of twins are boy/ girl fraternal twins . And are turning a year old in a month. My current pregnancy are identical boy (mo/di) twins. They will be here in June or before. So I got one set of each , not on purpose , but definitely blessed. Reply   Sammie  says: March 15, 2018 at 5:52 am I am currently 28, and 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins. Fraternal twins boy/girl set.  My first set of twins are fraternal twin girls they are four now. Never thought this would happen to me. I am not overweight, not y’all only 5’1 and am under 35. So this just shows that it can happen to anyone. Both sets conceived naturally. Only been pregnant twice, so I guess I can help honestly say I’ve been blessed . Good luck to you all. Reply   Stacey  says: March 22, 2018 at 6:01 pm I’m 12 weeks pregnant with my second set of mo/di (identical) twins. I have identical boys who just turned 4. Never thought in a million years we’d have 2 sets of twins. I’m 34, no fertility treatments, no family/genetic history of twins. Just blessed!

But, when reading the below, keep in mind that Michelle Duggar who has 18 children, only has 2 sets of twins!  Here's some good information:  Factors that Influence Twins Twins can occur naturally in any woman at any time. However, there are certain factors that increase your chances of having twins. These factors include:     Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably.    Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins.    Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. Women produce more ovulation-stimulating hormone as they age, increasing your chance of releasing more than one egg during ovulation. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39.    Previous Twins: If you’ve already had twins, it is more likely that you will have another twin pregnancy.    Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.    Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, women can increase their chances of having twins up to 20%.    Weight Gain : A study by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology linked the recent rise in multiple births with the steady rise of obesity in North America. Women with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 are more likely to have twins than those in the suggested BMI range of 19 to 25.     --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     j_l_badders    Posted 02/06/2009      I heard its more likely with fraternal than identicalsince fraternal is about releasing more than one egg and identical is a by chance thing with the egg splitting but I read somewhere (have no clue where now) while I was pregnant that its more than a 50% after fraternal but that doesn't seem likely???I do however know a 2x twin mom so yeah it happens.

But again, the chances are not 50% like some people think...again, Michelle Duggar has only had 2 sets of twins among her 18 children, and they were pretty far apart with several singletons in between.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     tazzersize2000 · Original Poster    Posted 02/06/2009      wow!  a co-worker at my old job had one kid then had a set of twins!!???mommytotwingirls do you plan on having any other children?

I heard from someone you can do a test to see if you ovulate two eggs every time.  If that is that case you can always do IVF  (in vitro fertilization) and put in one egg.  A friend of a friend wants to do this because her twins were born very early because of a problem she has and does not want to risk having another set of twins and losing them both.    --  JAM DS 1/2005 , DD 12/2006 Twins!

What are the chances of having twins twice?             aidasanchez26    Posted 08/12/2017       I have 16 month old twin boys. I wasn't ovulating at the time my DH  (dear husband) & I were tttc. So I started to take Vitex (a natural supplement to help you ovulate) within 3 wks of taking it O  (ovulation) became pregnant with the twins. I should also mention that I was taking twice the dosage recommended on the bottle as I was so desperate to become pregnant. I feel that caused spontaneous ovulation & I became pregnant with twins. We are thinking of trying again but are scared to become pregnant again with twins. I wouldn't take Vitex or any other supplement this time around, I would try naturally. I just turned 34 on July. Has anyone become pregnant with a singleton naturally after having twins?

But plenty of people have additional sets of twins too. I'd say go for it, but not til you're prepared for the possibility of twins again.

Overall though, it's about 1:11.  Think of Michelle Duggar.  She's had at least 21 pregnancies (that we know of) and in that, only 2 sets of fraternal twins, so she fits right in with the approx. 1:11 odds.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB             Reply            Report this comment       0                    TafadzwaJC    Posted 08/16/2017      I have a similar situation for me this time around I got pregnant naturally and my twin boys are only 18months old so am waiting to get my ultrasound and am nervous, scared, excited, anxious &all.....that I can have multiples again considering that twins run in my family, my mum had twins though they passed away and lots of my cousins have twins.

If they were identical that doesn't increase your chances any more than any other woman, unfortunately, since they're "spontaneous".  If they were fraternal you do have a better chance of having them again.. it really just depends on your body... if you're that adamant you could use fertility treatments to help increase your likelihood.

What are chances of having twins again?             sarah4305    Posted 12/19/2009       Hi ladies  I have 10 month old fraternal twin girls and a 2 year old son. I just found out last week I am preg. again! I am very happy but a little nervous it could be twins again. What do you think the odds are?  Dont get me wrong I adore my twins and think it is very special to have them, but I have had a rough year (girls born at 31wks, NICU, etc etc)   I am hoping for an easy pregnancy, delivery this time around.

I also heard this from other places as well but this is what it said:   Ok so you have already won the "Twin Parent lottery" once. What are the odds of you having a second set of twins?   If your first set of twins were fraternal, then your chances of having another set of fraternal twins is multiplied by four! That's 1 in 12!  If your first set of twins were identical, then your chances of having another set of identical twins drops way down to 1 in 70,000 or so.  If you are using fertility treatment, then the chances are the same as with your first set of twins.   Other factors that can increase the odds of multiples  There are many other factors that can increase your odds of having twins or multiples. Some of them are:   Your age. If you are over 50, then your chances of having twins increases to 1 in 9.  Your mother or grandmother is a fraternal twin. Studies have shown that if your mother is a fraternal twin, your chances of having fraternal twins might be has high as 1 in 17.  Your weight. Studies have shown that women with a body mass index of 30 or more have a significantly increased chance of having fraternal twins.   So according to most of the articles that  looked at said that your chance quadruples and it is 1 in 12 if your babies were fraternal and 1 in 70,000 if your babies were identicals.  Good Luck, Keep us posted with what you find out!    --  Cortney Taylor Danielle 09/02/05,  Jayden Joseph 04/25/08,  and Tw in boys Bertrand and Bryden 2/9/10!

The stats given by cortney21 are right- 1 in 12 once you've had a set of fraternal twins. But that also means 11 in 12 that you won't. When is your ultrasound? Mine is January 19th, and my husband and I keep going back and forth over whether we want twins again...

I am known for my google use lol, aren't I professional? hehe.  Yea mine are fraternal and the only history that I can find in my family is that my great g-ma may have miscarried with twins. So I guess I was just a lucky one! We don't think we will be having anymore kids, but if we do the thought of having another set of twins scares the crap out of us! We don't even have our first set yet, but it's just the thought of having 6 kids is enough to scare the crap out of me!    --  Cortney Taylor Danielle 09/02/05,  Jayden Joseph 04/25/08,  and Tw in boys Bertrand and Bryden 2/9/10!

(she lost 2 singletons). I have 4 sisters and 4 of us 5 sisters have been pregnant 2 or 3 times. I am the only girl with a set of fraternal twins! I never dreamed it would happen to me in my life b/c of the old wives tale "it skips a generation." I really did believe that. However I do fall in to catergory of higher chances to have fraternal twins b/c my mom did, I was in my 30's when the twins were concieved and I am over weight. So I guess it would be possible for it to happen again but I'm not betting on it! Good Luck to you in your new pregnancy though!

My twins are identical but i have been warned by ob gyn and perinatologist that i could have them again at increased risk just because i have done it once. I was so happy I wasnt have fraternal because of increase of happening again until I read some articles and doctors sprung that on me!  I have seen some research that suggest identical twins run on the man's side.  Which explains why some people have more than one set.  I like this theory because i can point the finger at hubby especially when im very crampy and having alot of contractions.

Identical twins are not from hereditary genetics. Identical twins are caused by the egg splitting.  As far as me having multiple multiple pregnancies.....the odds are greater of having multiples again than a single birth.    --  Thanks and God Bless, Tiffany FTM to identical twins Trinity Dawn and Destiny Hope and FTM to step-daughters Allison Elizabeth and Carolyn Marie             Reply            Report this comment       0               / 2      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

I only have one open fallopian tube, so it was a shock to ovulate twice from the same side and have twins. Twins run in EVERY generation of my family though and some women even got more then 1 set each. Plus, I was on the lowest dose of Clomid to help with ovulation. My doc said I have a 1 in 7 chance of having twins again just because of my already have fraternal twins, medication and genetic predisposition.

We went through the d&c procedure last week and thought of waiting for few months as we are still mentally shocked. We are very fond of having twins again but to my knowledge it doesn't run in our family. Is there a better chance of having twins again naturally? How to increase our chances of having twins again? Does a low dosage of clomid will give us twins? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  8 Posts k  kseds @taru84  It depends on a lot of factors. Your age, family history etc... You didn't say whether they were "fraternal" or "identical"....because it makes a difference. Fraternal twins are caused by "hyper ovulation" eg your ovaries releasing two or more eggs at ovulation. If that was the case, there is some small chance you could spontaneously conceive twins again. If identical, then it's completely random and there are no known causes or factors involved. To be honest your best shot at twins is via IVF - that will ensure 2 embryos are transferred - but it doesn't guarantee both will take or survive. Lastly, just be careful what you wish for... I ask you to spend even 10 minutes scrolling through and reading this board. There are countless stories of pre-eclampsia, pre term labour, premature rupture of membranes, gestational diabetes, Cholestasis, long NICU stays and even mortality. I lost my own twins a month ago at 20 weeks due to twin-specific complications. Twins are cute and fun but a multiple pregnancy is hard, stressful and dangerous. And life with twins is hard and stressful. Every mumma here feels lucky and blessed - but believe me when I say it's not all unicorns farting rainbows.... k  kseds @taru84  By the way I am very very sorry for your loss :( it is truly heartbreaking xx s  surgchick @kseds  Well said. R  RhiannonC Sorry for your loss. I agree with everything kseds said. I've read your chances of conceiving twins a second time increases if your first set were fraternal. Mine are di/di and more than likely fraternal, but I don't know of any twins in my family that I could have gotten the gene from. To just touch again on what she said, while the idea of twins is cool and all it is really no cake walk. I'm having a fairly easy pregnancy, but I have an almost 2 year old and I'm terrified of the newborn stage with two infants. I have seen too many moms lose one or both twins, just since I've been on this board, because of complications that they likely wouldn't have had had they been pregnant with one baby. I lost my first to a missed miscarriage so I can sympathize with you on a loss, but I would not recommend using a medication that you don't need just to try and get another set of twins. It took us 14 months of trying to get pregnant with our daughter and it was extremely stressful every month we failed to. Give yourselves time to grieve your losses and try again to get pregnant, with the hope of just getting pregnant period. s  shelleaschnelle @kseds  You're so awesome!! 4  4embies01 Well said kseds. I'm sorry for both of your losses and pray both of you will get pregnant again whether it's one or two. I recently found out that we were pregnant with twins and it was a shock to us. We always joked around having twins but it finally became a reality and then reading through this multiples thread and books, it became evident to me how much of a risk it can be for not only the babies but also myself. We were elated and ready for the challenge. We went through IVF and I've had two miscarriages prior so we were so happy and blessed to hear that we were pregnant with two miracles. Yesterday at my 8w1day ultrasound, we found out one of the twins may be a vanishing twin. I'll know better next week. We were both sad and happy at the same time as one of the babies was measuring perfectly and had a strong heartbeat. This is the furthest I have ever been in a pregnancy. Sometimes we are blessed with these miracles but I think whatever is meant to be whether you have one or two is a blessing. 4  4embies01 @wonka5  Wonka, thank you. Congrats also! It's been quite a journey for us.

I had a daughter on Sept 27th 2008 & I wanted my second really close in age so I got pregnant again by December (when my first dd was 3-4 mos old). I had my son on Sept 28th, 2009 making them a year and a day apart exactly so pretty much Irish twins. Then this past April my hubby & I weren't even thinking about ovulating or babies or anything & sure enough, pregnancy #3 lol. I was okay with it, thinking one more would be fine. At twelve weeks along found out there were twins. So next Friday I'll be having my c-section to welcome our two new baby girls, and my kids will be two and a half, one and a half, and newborns. It will be a little hard at times & tiring I know but I love seeing how close my two kids are now & I know it'll be awesome as they grow up & all have each other. :) Let me know how it goes- you can look me up on Facebook if u want manderz_246@yahoo.com T  Twoplustwins @ajlf246  Congrats! You will be a busy bee won't you?? LOL I have 4, but they are 8,6 and 5 months.. not too bad.  I just have a feeling that i am going to be pregnant, but not sure yet obviously.. I am a little anxious.. I don't know what he was thinking.. but i have to admit that I am a tad excited! LOL We decided that if i am pregnant we wont tell a soul until i can't hide it anymore! And I will def look you up! Thanks Jen J  Jmhamilton3 @Twoplustwins  From everything I've read it is much more comman to have 2 sets of frats than 2 sets of idents. The egg splitting is random and the 2 eggs is not. So if you are pregnant, good chance it will be only one baby. Good luck! Your girls are adorable! T  Twoplustwins @Jmhamilton3  Thanks... I know that having two sets of id would be rare.. But wanted to see if anyone here has two sets.. Also I'm wondering if since I just started getting my period from being pregnant if I'd be more likely to be releasing two eggs.... I can test on the 8th.. Can't come soon enough!

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

Started by proudmumoftwingirls , Aug 27 2009 11:05 AM        Please log in to reply     10 replies to this topic            #1   proudmumoftwingirls    Posted 27 August 2009 - 11:05 AM    I gave birth to fraternal twin girls 4mths ago. They were conceived naturally. We are concidering having more children in the next few years, but are just wondering if the chances of conceiving twins again is higher once you have them. Also how long after having twins did you have more babies and how difficult was it? Both my husband and I are 26 and want to complete our family by the time we are 30. How much did everything change for you with 3. I am just thinking of the logistics of everything ie: new car will be needed unless we can fit 3 car seats in a Ford XR6. We have 2 safe n sound meridian car seats at the moment and I can only just fit between them.      Back to top                #2   nessrose    Posted 27 August 2009 - 12:56 PM    I'm a fraternal twin. I've had a singleton who is 4, then fraternal twins who are 2. I'm now 35 weeks pregnant with a singleton again. Your chances do increase if you've had fraternals before (about 4 times more likely than the average woman to have them again), however I guess it's the risk you have to take if you want more than 2. Did have me worried though so I know what you mean. Logistically you just learn to cope. We used a double pram with skateboard for DD1. She now walks though. Up until now we've had a Falcon Stationwagon which had plenty of room for kids, prams and groceries etc. We've now upgraded to a Tarago. I'm finding it great at the moment although at times challenging. Trying not to think about what it is going to be like having 4 under 4 and 2 months!  I guess it depends on the personality of your twins too, whether or not they are sleeping through the night etc. Even though this pregnancy wasn't exactly planned (although is very much wanted), my girls have been sleeping through the night since they were 5 months old so am not too worried about going through the whole newborn stage again. You are definitely bound to be more relaxed having had more than one before as well. Good luck.

Back to top                #4   gumby    Posted 27 August 2009 - 04:26 PM    Yes, if you naturally conceived fraternal twins, your chances of having them again are definitely very much increased.   Our frat twins were #3 & #4 and we are very much completed by them but if it helps, this is my 'gyno' history. DS#1 - Singleton M/C - Blighted ovum M/C - Twins M/C - Partial Molar preg DS#2 - Singleton DS#3 & DD1 - Twins From my own history, it would seem that I sometimes release two eggs.  If we were not finished with our family, we would definitely have to factor in the increased likelihood of multiples in any subsequent pregnancies. Good luck, you have adorable looking girls there       Back to top                #5   lustreless    Posted 27 August 2009 - 07:07 PM    My twins are also fraternal and naturally concieved, #2 and #3 I am pregnant with my second singleton since having my twins so I am here to assure you it probably won't happen again It was something I really worried about because I did not cope very well with my twins until they started school. I think out of all my years here on EB there is only one lady I know of that has had a second set of naturally conceived twins so its not as prevalent as the odds might make you believe. There have been a couple of others but those twins were results of fertility treatment. If you want another baby I say go for it, if you do have twins again it was obviously meant to be. PS - My twins were over 6 pounds each....how the hell did you carry two 8+ pound babies??

My DS was 8lb 1 oz and I was proud of myself cause I thought THAT was big       Back to top                #7   Phoebe2010    Posted 27 August 2009 - 08:03 PM    I'm another one gasping at your fabulous birth weights. I'm 9 weeks pregnant with twins and scared about low birth weight and associated problems - what was your secret?? Sorry I can't help with your question - these are my first.      Back to top                #8   proudmumoftwingirls    Posted 28 August 2009 - 03:05 PM    LOL A lot of people are astouded when I tell them that both my girls were over 8lb each when born. I am pretty god damn proud of myself that I got them to term. Believe me it was not easy carrying them especially the last month or two. I was hospitalised with back pain before birth and pretty much camped on the lounge for the last month or two of the pregnancy. I even rang when obstetrician crying one day a few weeks before they were born to deliver them early as I was in so much pain. Thank goodness he wouldn't do it as it gave them more time to grow and I am thankful for it now. I don't have a secret for it. I couldn't eat much while I was pregnant as the first 3mths I had 24/7 nausea (no vomitting though) so couldn't really eat. I craved milk for the last 4-5 months of my pregnancy so that may have contributed somehow I guess. I love having twins, but hated being pregnant with them so I wouldn't be disappointed if I ended up with another set once we decide to try again. Has anyone heard of twins this size or bigger? I know it's not that common. I might start a new topic finding out as it would be interesting to know. BECSJ - I have recovered great. I had a caesar so was uncomfortable for about 6wks, but not out of action. As with a natural birth aswell my hormones went crazy for about 3-4wks after the birth and I was pretty emotional about anything and everything, but got over it and I feel great these days. My girls are great and it has been so easy so far. Ask me again when they are moving about on their own lol.       Back to top                #9   Butterscotch    Posted 30 August 2009 - 08:40 AM    There's been a few threads on this which might be helpful (I recall starting a couple 2 or so years ago when we were trying to decide!), could pay to search or look back a few pages I had a similar dilemma when trying to decide whether or nto to have another baby after my twin daughters.  My girls are fraternal too.  As others have said, your chances of having twins again are higher than your average, but there's more chance you'd have a singleton (generally speaking, I can't say for certain for you personally as I do know of numerous cases of women having more than one set of naturally conceived multiples!  Some women are made to have multiples I guess! ) While we were trying to decide on whether or not to have another, God decided for us, and when Emily and Kailtyn were 20 months old I found myself pregnant!  I was VERY scared of having twins again.  We didn't have a good experience with pregnancy/birth/they were prem and never slept or fed well.  Lucky for us, we had a singleton.  There was 2yrs,4mths between them.  I would have liked a bigger age gap, but as they're all getting older I'm glad for a smaller one, so it's kinda short term pain, for long term gain.  I agree with a PP who said it depends a lot on the personality and habits of your kids, and the parents!  None of my kids have been good sleepers so that doesn't help... Oh.  And.  YES!  Am suitably impressed with your twin DD's weights How brilliant! (my two were 1.5 and 1.6kgs )   Edited by Butterscotch, 30 August 2009 - 08:41 AM.

(Seperate sacs and placentas but they look very similar!) We have just decided to start TTC our third and final child, but I keep wondering how we will manage if it is twins again! Not knowing whether the boys are identical leaves me unsure as to how high the chances are - I've heard it could be as high as a 1 in 4 chance of twins again if your first pregnancy resulted in fraternal twins. Of course, whatever will be will be and at least we've done it once before and know what to expect. But I still can't help thinking about it, and all the implications. Apart from anything else, the financial burden would just be so stressful! But then again, I adore having twins, seeing them interact makes my heart melt. Perhaps another set wouldn't be so bad..... So, anyone else share my concern???

I know it was awful, I know that every horrid pregnancy symptom you can get I got in spades, I know my waters broke at 29 + 6 and they were born by emergency c section at 30 + 3, but somehow I don't remember just how rough it was. I do remember crying a few times when I had to leave them in hospital each night after they were born (I never cry in public, I don't think my best friend has even seen me cry, so it stands out in my memory) but I still don't really remember how bad it felt. I guess that's why I'm potentially putting myself up for round two!!!

I adore my babies and love having twins. .... but given my health complications during pregnancy and that I know that we don't want four children, we have decided not to go for a third, in case we did end up with twins again. Is it worth getting your two tested to see if they are ID? It might help you decide.

I've had a relatively straight forward pregnancy as far as twin pregnancies go, and I would not do this again in a million years!!! But my stress may have more to do with the fact that I have a 19 month old and a 3 year old to chase after, plus an 8 year old step son. And I'm not getting any younger either. This pregnancy has aged me more than the others. I've also been told that if we were to try again, chances are extremely high that I would have another twin pregnancy. So hubby is definitely getting the snip!! Don't get me wrong, I am very excited to meet my new boys in the next week. But it has been very hard work to make it mentally and physically to this stage.

We had a singleton, then twins, singleton, then fell pregnant with twins again. We lost one of them unfortunately. Just had our last 4 weeks ago. At times I'm glad we didn't have 2 again, but mostly I feel sad that our other little one didn't make it. Good luck whatever you decide.

We have begun TTC again though, and will be very happy either way. Will simply try extra hard to win the lotto if necessary! Sunniedayz I neglected to say earlier how sorry I am that you lost your twins, I can't imagine how that felt and can certainly understand your feelings of apprehension.

The other interesting thing is that you can have your cycle monitored via a fertility clinic.  They can see the number of follicles that are ready to release eggs each month.  If you show one follicle - then you can go for it.  If more then 1 then you might want to wait a month. Warning - some follicles contain one egg, some contain none, and some contain more then one egg.  So it's not fool proof or anything - but it is the way IUI (artificial insemination) is monitored at the fertility clinics and mostly there is only one egg per follicle. GoodLuck, S.     Back to top                #17   shoopdeboop    Posted 04 June 2012 - 11:11 AM    I have 10 yr old fraternal twins and am now pregnant with my 3rd child. I was so worried about having twins again I could not really enjoy the pregnancy until I found out. I was so relieved when they found one in there. I had a hard time bringing them up, and not in any medical way, just in a bringing babies/ young children up way and was mega worried of going through those younger years again with another two babies. Last thing I want in the world! I am so happy I am going to experience just having one!! After this one, I might be ok with falling pregnant with twins again if it happened, as I will have eased back into it with a singleton. But I have really really wanted to experience having just one baby and I'm so happy I'm  going to be able to have that!  :-)     Back to top                #18   Jackrabbit    Posted 26 June 2012 - 02:16 PM    We used assisted conception and got twins. Now we're going back to TTC #3. The risk is there that we will get twins again as too small a dose does nothing for me but a higher dose might make me release 2 eggs. My first pregnancy was a singleton though. I don't think I'd be devastated if I had twins again. In some ways it will be easier as I have a better idea of what I'm doing, but with the other 2 wanting attention too it will be harder whether it's one baby or two.

I have nearly 8 month old fraternal twin boys and I have been wondering and thinking about what the chances are of having twins again. Does anyone know? Is it higher the second time round then the first or makes no difference whether you have had twins before or not. I think about what I would do if I was to be pregnant again with twins. On one hand I think to myself there is no way I could do twins again especially with a set already then on the other hand I think well I've done it once and I don't know anything but raising two babies at once! I know that if I ever did have twins again, we would cope just like we are now. Anyway just interested in knowing :-) I still get so many strangers and even people I know saying to me 'gee you must have your hands full' or 'you must find it really tough with two' and I my reaction is always the same. 'To me is seems easy to raise twins because they are my first and I don't know any different. I don't know what its like to have only one baby to look after!     Back to top                #2   Helena Handbasket    Posted 17 October 2011 - 10:56 AM    There is a significantly higher chance, but I can't remember exactly what the odds are.

Pretty sure that was for frats.     Back to top                #6   Breezles    Posted 17 October 2011 - 08:13 PM    I was told by a doctor there was a 1 in 4 chance of having twins again if you have conceived them before. I had a singleton (girl) at age 33 and then at 36 fell pregnant with fraternal twins who I then lost at 7 weeks. 8 months later after 4 months of trying I fell pregant again with frat twins and gave birth to healthy twin boys in April of this year. There is also a much higher chance of twins if you conceive between ages 34-39 (my case in point) as you are ovulating more eratically and might not ovulate one month and then pop out two eggs the next month. I also had a family history on my maternal side which is another strong indicator. My husband is having a vasectomy soon as he is certain we will fall pregnant with another set if we were to try for number 4!! Definitely agree having a singleton after twins would be easier! I notice a big difference when I've just got 1 of the twin babies with me as opposed to 2. I highly recommend having them spaced 3 years plus as twin toddlers and an infant would be challenging. My daughter is a huge help to me at age 4 and I don't think I would have coped as well with a demanding toddler & newborn twins.

If I'm a fraternal twin?  Started by Cyaira , Aug 08 2011 06:15 PM        Please log in to reply     9 replies to this topic            #1   Cyaira    Posted 08 August 2011 - 06:15 PM    Hello all, I am sure this question has been asked before but after googling this question I have seen all sorts of mixed statistics! So my question is this: If I'm a female, fraternal twin - what are my chances of having twins? (IVF excluded?) What factors contribute to fraternal twins? Can someone explain the genetics of this to me? Hyper-ovulation?? If relevant, my mother had us at 37 and it was her fourth pregnancy. We  were not conceived via IVF. My mother has twins on both her mother and  father's side. I have loved being a twin and would love to have a set of twins. I have been told I have the highest chance of naturally having twins out of any statistics but I'm unsure if it's true. That said, I would love ANY child I had. It's mostly out of curiosity I ask.     Back to top                #2   bronzzeAngel    Posted 08 August 2011 - 06:20 PM    I have heard that sometimes the older the mum, the higher the chances of having twins. I do know that my mum lost twin boys between me and my sister and her age would of been around 38 to 41 at the time. though even though that said, they can run in families     Back to top                #3   Sammitty    Posted 08 August 2011 - 08:24 PM    From what i understand as you have the gene you will throw two eggs as you get older. My gran is fraternal and my mum is also fraternal.  Mum didn't have twins which we believe is likely to e because she stopped having kids at 26. I am 31 this year and have fraternal twins due in march, naturally no assistance. You are also more likely with subsequent births, but i don't know if tha is just because you are older.  That s what i have found out anyway and it rings true for us.  Good luck!      Back to top                #4   RedsGirl    Posted 08 August 2011 - 09:07 PM    I have also heard your chances of twins increases as you get older. My maternal Nana also had fraternal twins and she must have been at least 40, as they were her last two babies.  My aunt on my Dad's side also had fraternal twins and she would have been mid-late 30s. I had also heard it can skip a generation, but not sure how true that is - may be an old wives tale.      Back to top                #5   trdl    Posted 08 August 2011 - 09:16 PM    I think you have a higher chance of having twins if you are a fraternal twin yourself. My husband is an identical twin and its said that the chances of us having twins are quite low. Unless fraternal runs through my mothers side. My sister had fraternal twins at 19. We are trying for another baby and i would just love to have a set of twins. DH is not so sure      Back to top                #6   Cyaira    Posted 08 August 2011 - 09:51 PM    Thanks for the responses, now I'm intrigued and have been thinking... If Sammitty is correct about genes that throw eggs twice then I think I can see why it skips a generation... The gene must be in a female for it to work (understandably, since men can't ovulate) but males can pass it on. So my mother passes the gene on to my brother.. my brother's wife won't have twins but their daughters might because he passed the gene on to them. It's not an exact skip in this case but it could happen!

I had my heart on having twins with pregnancy no 2, and had a gorgeous girl. With pregnancy no 3, twins were the last thing on my mind, so of course, you can guess what happened lol.     Back to top                #8   Becs    Posted 08 August 2011 - 10:27 PM    Yes you should have a slightly higher chance as you are a fraternal twin.. I keep telling my fraternal twins that I can't wait for them to have their own set... Insert evil laugh here... Any woman aged over 37  and has more than 3 children is naturally at a higher chance of hyper-ovulation resulting in fraternal twins. I remember how many Dr's/midwives commented on our naturally conceived set as I was 29 when I fell pregnant. They said is was quite uncommon for that age group.     Back to top                #9   Ciel    Posted 08 August 2011 - 10:38 PM    I think the current statistics in Australia are that the chance of having fraternal twins is about 1:70.  But this is the average chance - it is lower if you are in your 20's, higher once you get older than about 35 (and once you are 45 or older, your chance of having twins is 17%!  (~1:6!). then, if your mother or sister had fraternal twins, your underlying chance is doubled QUOTE The rate of dizygotic twinning is increased in women aged 35–39 years,  with higher parity and tall stature. Rates fall in severely malnourished  women. Dizygotic twinning runs in families. If a mother or a sister has  dizygotic twins, a woman has double the risk of having dizygotic twins  herself. If she has dizygotic twins herself, her risk of having future  dizygotic twins is quadrupled So, overall, your chance is twice the average, and will increase with age (though obviously this is offset by reduced fertility)     Back to top                #10   nessrose    Posted 11 August 2011 - 09:36 AM    I'm a fraternal twin.

I have no known family history of twins either and no fertility tx/meds ever. My husband always jokes we would end up with triplets if we had another pregnancy. Odds are higher than the general population for another set of fraternals. I guess the only way to find out is to try for another baby. Just kinda freaks me out that there are even moms that don't have a strong family history of multiples and no fertility treatments end up with two sets. Amazing!!! Congrats!

This is because most women who conceive fraternals (without fertility drugs) show a pattern of releasing more than one egg per cycle. Your chance of a second set numerically, is about 1 in 3000 The odds of having one set of identicals and one set of fraternals is 1 in 10,000. If a woman has one set of identicals, her chance of having another is 1 in 70,000 or less. The odds of having 3 sets of twins, of any kind, is 1 in 500,000.

Most likely the 2nd and maybe even 3rd pregnancy would be singles. twins after twins typically occur 2-3 pregnancies apart. I had b/g twins Feb 2009 and when I found out Nov 2009 I was pregnant again, I freaked out and spoke to a specialist and he assured me that, although it is possible, it is not very likely at all. He said to beware though the next pregnancy. Some people say that they can ONLY have twins, but even this is not true. It may be true that they ONLY ovulate multiple eggs but that does not even mean that each egg will be fertilized and implant. The chances of even one ovulated egg being fertilized and implanting to become and embryo is still not 100% so much less so is it that 2 or more would be. That is another reason twins are not so common as singletons. You should be fine. Of course, as everything else in life, it is never guaranteed, but your chances are tremendously higher of having a single birth this time around. But like my specialist told me...if you have another after this one, don't be surprised to see 2 again! GL! oh and by the way, I am only having 1 this time!

Identical: no increase in probability of having another set.  Fraternal:  definitely a higher probability.  1 in 12 cited below is about right.

I have a son who is 6 twin girls who are almost 5 and their sister who is almost 4. I always get my you have your hands full. Which is a true statement but not as hard as most people make it out to be. I think if you want more kids don't let the thought of having more multiples scare you. If you believe in God pray and tell him your worries. He will help you get through anything. Nothing is to big or small. As moms we always figure out a way to get through what ever comes we are built this way. If you live near family get them involved. and never let the negative attitudes prevail in your life. You may hear you are crazy to have more. But truth be told they are just scared they couldn't do it and if you do you are better than they are. I am tired a lot, but I think if you ask any mom they will also say they get tired. My kids are young and back to back. Most of the time I get asked if I have triplets. But in all honesty I am happy they are close in age because my girls are the best of friends. My son is amazing. Not going to lie it is a lot of work but if you are up fro it then go for it.

Fraternals do increase your chances but not as much as you may think.  I was told it's about 10% more likely on your next pregnancy, which is pretty much what Destiny said. I had a singleton 13 months after I had spontaneous fraternal twins.

They (the twins) will be 18 months old when Annabelle is born. I was nervous in the beginning that it would be twins again bc we were not planning to get pregnant so soon in the first place, but my doctor, who is a multiples specialist, said that your chances DO increase after having twins, but not for the next 2 pregnancies so much. He said it is very unlikely to have twins directly following twins. Also, a lot of people think that your chances of having twins go up to 40% but he also said that that number is not accurate. Your chances only go up to 1 in 12 which is about 8%. It is drastically more than the initial (I think it was) 1.3% everyone has in the beginning, but it is still not HIGHLY likely. Just MUCH MORE likely. But 8% is worth the risk, in my oppinion. If you have twins first, then after you have 2 single births, though, then your chances will increase to 40% and he said that is where that number comes from. Also, these statistics are for people who conceive fraternal twins ONLY and only conceiving them naturally. So if identicals are any part of it then your chances are still EXTREMELY low and if they were assisted reproduction of any sort, then they are counted differently as well.

If I recall correctly, your chances of twins again are pretty high if you had conceived them naturally (vs IVF) as you probably release more than one egg each cycle.

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Twins          Back to Twins           English   Español       My son is going to have twins. I'm a fraternal twin and I have another brother and sister that are fraternal twins. My husband has on his side of the family twins (fraternal) and triplets - boys. Is our son having twins because of our background? Does it have to do with our genetics?        -A curious adult   June 25, 2014  That is a very interesting question! And one that many people wonder about. In fact, we answered a very similar question many years ago.  Twin genetics depend on what kind of twins we are talking about. Having identical twins is not genetic. On the other hand, fraternal twins can run in families.  Genetics can definitely play a role in having fraternal twins. For example, a woman that has a sibling that is a fraternal twin is 2.5 times more likely to have twins than average!  However, for a given pregnancy, only the mother’s genetics matter. Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are simultaneously fertilized instead of just one. A father’s genes can’t make a woman release two eggs.  It sounds like fraternal twins do indeed run in your family! But, since your son is the father, his genes are on the wrong side of the family tree. So, your family history likely didn’t play a role in his wife’s twin pregnancy.  The answer would be different if you were asking about a daughter. Also, although your son’s family history of twins can’t increase his wife’s chance of having twins, he can pass those genes down to your granddaughter. With your strong family history of fraternal twins, this just might increase the chances of your granddaughter having twins!  But, your daughter-in-law is not necessarily having twins because of her genetics. Other things like environment, nutrition, age, and weight have also been linked to having twins as well.  And there is always simple chance…every woman has a chance at having fraternal twins.  It is just that some women have a higher or lower chance.   Huh? Help Me Understand the Genetics!  Wait a minute. One type of twins has a genetic basis and the other does not? And, only the mom’s genetics matter? How is that possible?  Don’t worry. It makes a lot of sense once we break down the biology.  The important difference between identical and fraternal twins is the number of fertilized eggs involved. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg. Fraternal twins come from two different ones.  Identical twins happen when a single embryo splits in two soon after fertilization. This is why identical twins have identical DNA. They came from the same fertilized egg.  Since embryo splitting is a random event that happens by chance, it doesn’t run in families. Genes are not involved. The same is not true for fraternal twins.  Fraternal twins happen when two independent eggs are each fertilized by different sperm.  This is why the DNA of fraternal twins is different. In fact, fhe DNA of fraternal twins is no more similar than the DNA any other sibling pair.  Usually, a woman only releases a single egg at a time. Fraternal twins can only happen if a mother releases two eggs in one cycle. This is called hyperovulation.  Unlike embryo splitting, ovulation is a normal biological process that is controlled by our genes. And, different women can have different versions of these ovulation genes.  Some women have versions (called alleles) of these genes that make them more likely to hyperovulate. This means there is a higher chance that two eggs could get fertilized at once, leading to fraternal twins.  The gene versions that increase the chance of hyperovulation can be passed down from parent to child. This is why fraternal twins run in families.  However, only women ovulate. So, the mother’s genes control this and the fathers don’t.  This is why having a background of twins in the family matters only if it is on the mother’s side. And why your son’s family genetics did not play a role in his twins.  We went over a lot of this stuff in our previous answer, but your question got me thinking. Our last answer on twins was done so long ago. Has recent research discovered anything new on this fascinating topic? They have indeed… at least if you are a sheep!   Counting Sheep can Teach us about Twins  Scientists often turn to animals when they want to study a biological process. Some of the newest information we have about twin genetics comes from studying sheep.  Sheep were chosen because, like people, they typically give birth to a single lamb. However, they can sometimes have twins and triplets.  Different breeds of sheep naturally have higher or lower twin rates.  These different breeds have different versions (called alleles) of some of their genes. Specific alleles can make certain breeds more likely to have twins.  We can compare the genes between these different breeds to try to find the genes controlling twinning. And, this is just what scientists did.  A thorough search for genes controlling twining in sheep identified several interesting ones. The breeds with higher twin rates had different alleles of these genes!  Three key sheep genes identified were named BMP15, GDF9, and BMPR1B. The specific gene names are not really important. Just know that all of these genes are involved in controlling ovulation. Which makes sense!  Remember, hyperovulation increases the chance of having fraternal twins. The sheep breeds with higher than average twin rates had versions of the genes that increase ovulation.  Sheep are a great tool to help us study twin genetics. The tricky part is connecting these findings to people.  It is harder to study humans. Scientists have tried to find links between the genes identified in sheep and human twin genetics. So far they’ve found that some match up and some don’t. This, in and of itself, is interesting!  Another gene called follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH for short, has also been linked to twins in humans. Like the other three genes identified, this FSH is also involved in promoting ovulation, and mothers of fraternal twins often have high levels of it.  It seems that twin genetics is more complicated in humans than in sheep. More genes are likely involved. But, each new bit of information about the genes involved adds another puzzle piece to the complete genetic picture.  Maybe someday we will know all the genes that cause fraternal twins in people.  But for now, you can just tell your son that his genetics likely didn’t cause his twins. Scientists are still trying to figure out which, if any, genes on his wife’s side could possibly be the culprits!

By Stephanie / 5						COMMENTS  111 Shares    Most moms consider themselves lucky enough to have one set of twins, but if you’re incredibly lucky, then you might even end up with two pairs of twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice?    What are the chances of having twins? The birth rate for twins is only going up, rising by as much as 76% in the last 30 years. That means that your chance of having twins in the USA is as high as 3 in 100 births. But that’s fraternal twins. The chance of identical twins is the same as it’s always been, which is around 3 in 1000 babies born as identical twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice? Obviously, the chance of having two sets of twins is pretty rare, but it’s not as rare as you might think. If you’re looking for two sets of twins of any type, the chance of that is around 1 in 3,000, which is the same chance as getting struck by lightning during your life!   A set of identical twins and fraternal twins is only around 1 in 10,000, or the same odds that you’re going to fall off your toilet and end up in hospital! Having two sets of identical twins is pretty damn unlikely, with only 1 chance in 70,000. Bear in mind that if you’ve already got one set of twins, you might actually be more likely to have a second set, because of all of the things that increase your chances of twin births. Things like: Having already been pregnant before. Women who have already had a baby, including women who have already had twins, are more likely to have twins in the future! Getting older. Women over the age of around 35 have more twins in general, because in the few years before you hit peri-menopause, your ovaries start to release more than one egg at a time. Having some sort of fertility treatment, like IVF or fertility drugs. These sort of things can stimulate your body to produce multiple eggs over and over. Coming from a family with twins in it. There’s some sort of genetic component to twins, and if twins run in your family, then you’re more likely to have them. This also means that if you’ve had twins once, they might run in your family and you might have them again! Being on the pill, or just coming off of the pill. Apparently, the hormonal changes that the pill causes in women can increase their chances of having twins. Being taller or heavier than average. Taller and heavier women have a greater than normal chance of having twins . But remember to stay healthy! Make sure your partner has a lot of zinc in his diet. Zinc contributes to healthy sperm, and the healthier your partner’s sperm, the more you have of chance of conceiving twins! Twins are getting more and more common, so if you have one set of twins and you’re going for another, you might just get lucky! How do you think you would cope with two sets of twins? Do you know anyone who actually has two sets of twins? Or maybe you’re one of the incredibly fortunate women who beat the odds and has an awesome foursome! Let us know in the comments below!        Nicole  says: October 25, 2017 at 10:20 pm I actually know 2 people within 30 mins of each other who have 2 pairs of twins! Reply   Deidre Turner  says: November 17, 2017 at 5:01 am Me! I’m 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins (both di/di). My first set were conceived with the assistance of fertility treatment (IUI), then I had a singleton conceived naturally and I’m pregnant with twins again, conceived naturally this time. I’m not particularly tall or big, I’m under 35 (currently 34 and was 29 having my first set), I haven’t been on the pill for years and hubby’s sperm counts are ok but not great. I’ve only been pregnant 3 times. I was on only 25mg (half a tablet) of clomid for 4 cycles over 5 years ago so that’s all the fertility drugs I ever took. It explains the first set but not the second set. I think that family history is my biggest influence; my nanna had 2 sets of twins and a set of triplets; my mum is one of the triplets. I’m the only one in my large extended family who has had any multiples at all so it looks like the twin gene skipped straight to me! Reply   Katie Hopkins  says: February 28, 2018 at 7:51 am I’m 24 years old and pregnant with my second set of twins. No fertility treatments or help . My first set of twins are boy/ girl fraternal twins . And are turning a year old in a month. My current pregnancy are identical boy (mo/di) twins. They will be here in June or before. So I got one set of each , not on purpose , but definitely blessed. Reply   Sammie  says: March 15, 2018 at 5:52 am I am currently 28, and 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins. Fraternal twins boy/girl set.  My first set of twins are fraternal twin girls they are four now. Never thought this would happen to me. I am not overweight, not y’all only 5’1 and am under 35. So this just shows that it can happen to anyone. Both sets conceived naturally. Only been pregnant twice, so I guess I can help honestly say I’ve been blessed . Good luck to you all. Reply   Stacey  says: March 22, 2018 at 6:01 pm I’m 12 weeks pregnant with my second set of mo/di (identical) twins. I have identical boys who just turned 4. Never thought in a million years we’d have 2 sets of twins. I’m 34, no fertility treatments, no family/genetic history of twins. Just blessed!

But, when reading the below, keep in mind that Michelle Duggar who has 18 children, only has 2 sets of twins!  Here's some good information:  Factors that Influence Twins Twins can occur naturally in any woman at any time. However, there are certain factors that increase your chances of having twins. These factors include:     Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably.    Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins.    Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. Women produce more ovulation-stimulating hormone as they age, increasing your chance of releasing more than one egg during ovulation. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39.    Previous Twins: If you’ve already had twins, it is more likely that you will have another twin pregnancy.    Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.    Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, women can increase their chances of having twins up to 20%.    Weight Gain : A study by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology linked the recent rise in multiple births with the steady rise of obesity in North America. Women with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 are more likely to have twins than those in the suggested BMI range of 19 to 25.     --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     j_l_badders    Posted 02/06/2009      I heard its more likely with fraternal than identicalsince fraternal is about releasing more than one egg and identical is a by chance thing with the egg splitting but I read somewhere (have no clue where now) while I was pregnant that its more than a 50% after fraternal but that doesn't seem likely???I do however know a 2x twin mom so yeah it happens.

But again, the chances are not 50% like some people think...again, Michelle Duggar has only had 2 sets of twins among her 18 children, and they were pretty far apart with several singletons in between.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     tazzersize2000 · Original Poster    Posted 02/06/2009      wow!  a co-worker at my old job had one kid then had a set of twins!!???mommytotwingirls do you plan on having any other children?

I heard from someone you can do a test to see if you ovulate two eggs every time.  If that is that case you can always do IVF  (in vitro fertilization) and put in one egg.  A friend of a friend wants to do this because her twins were born very early because of a problem she has and does not want to risk having another set of twins and losing them both.    --  JAM DS 1/2005 , DD 12/2006 Twins!

What are the chances of having twins twice?             aidasanchez26    Posted 08/12/2017       I have 16 month old twin boys. I wasn't ovulating at the time my DH  (dear husband) & I were tttc. So I started to take Vitex (a natural supplement to help you ovulate) within 3 wks of taking it O  (ovulation) became pregnant with the twins. I should also mention that I was taking twice the dosage recommended on the bottle as I was so desperate to become pregnant. I feel that caused spontaneous ovulation & I became pregnant with twins. We are thinking of trying again but are scared to become pregnant again with twins. I wouldn't take Vitex or any other supplement this time around, I would try naturally. I just turned 34 on July. Has anyone become pregnant with a singleton naturally after having twins?

But plenty of people have additional sets of twins too. I'd say go for it, but not til you're prepared for the possibility of twins again.

Overall though, it's about 1:11.  Think of Michelle Duggar.  She's had at least 21 pregnancies (that we know of) and in that, only 2 sets of fraternal twins, so she fits right in with the approx. 1:11 odds.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB             Reply            Report this comment       0                    TafadzwaJC    Posted 08/16/2017      I have a similar situation for me this time around I got pregnant naturally and my twin boys are only 18months old so am waiting to get my ultrasound and am nervous, scared, excited, anxious &all.....that I can have multiples again considering that twins run in my family, my mum had twins though they passed away and lots of my cousins have twins.

If they were identical that doesn't increase your chances any more than any other woman, unfortunately, since they're "spontaneous".  If they were fraternal you do have a better chance of having them again.. it really just depends on your body... if you're that adamant you could use fertility treatments to help increase your likelihood.

What are chances of having twins again?             sarah4305    Posted 12/19/2009       Hi ladies  I have 10 month old fraternal twin girls and a 2 year old son. I just found out last week I am preg. again! I am very happy but a little nervous it could be twins again. What do you think the odds are?  Dont get me wrong I adore my twins and think it is very special to have them, but I have had a rough year (girls born at 31wks, NICU, etc etc)   I am hoping for an easy pregnancy, delivery this time around.

I also heard this from other places as well but this is what it said:   Ok so you have already won the "Twin Parent lottery" once. What are the odds of you having a second set of twins?   If your first set of twins were fraternal, then your chances of having another set of fraternal twins is multiplied by four! That's 1 in 12!  If your first set of twins were identical, then your chances of having another set of identical twins drops way down to 1 in 70,000 or so.  If you are using fertility treatment, then the chances are the same as with your first set of twins.   Other factors that can increase the odds of multiples  There are many other factors that can increase your odds of having twins or multiples. Some of them are:   Your age. If you are over 50, then your chances of having twins increases to 1 in 9.  Your mother or grandmother is a fraternal twin. Studies have shown that if your mother is a fraternal twin, your chances of having fraternal twins might be has high as 1 in 17.  Your weight. Studies have shown that women with a body mass index of 30 or more have a significantly increased chance of having fraternal twins.   So according to most of the articles that  looked at said that your chance quadruples and it is 1 in 12 if your babies were fraternal and 1 in 70,000 if your babies were identicals.

The stats given by cortney21 are right- 1 in 12 once you've had a set of fraternal twins. But that also means 11 in 12 that you won't. When is your ultrasound? Mine is January 19th, and my husband and I keep going back and forth over whether we want twins again...

I am known for my google use lol, aren't I professional? hehe.  Yea mine are fraternal and the only history that I can find in my family is that my great g-ma may have miscarried with twins. So I guess I was just a lucky one! We don't think we will be having anymore kids, but if we do the thought of having another set of twins scares the crap out of us! We don't even have our first set yet, but it's just the thought of having 6 kids is enough to scare the crap out of me!    --  Cortney Taylor Danielle 09/02/05,  Jayden Joseph 04/25/08,  and Tw in boys Bertrand and Bryden 2/9/10!

(she lost 2 singletons). I have 4 sisters and 4 of us 5 sisters have been pregnant 2 or 3 times. I am the only girl with a set of fraternal twins! I never dreamed it would happen to me in my life b/c of the old wives tale "it skips a generation." I really did believe that. However I do fall in to catergory of higher chances to have fraternal twins b/c my mom did, I was in my 30's when the twins were concieved and I am over weight. So I guess it would be possible for it to happen again but I'm not betting on it! Good Luck to you in your new pregnancy though!

My twins are identical but i have been warned by ob gyn and perinatologist that i could have them again at increased risk just because i have done it once. I was so happy I wasnt have fraternal because of increase of happening again until I read some articles and doctors sprung that on me!  I have seen some research that suggest identical twins run on the man's side.  Which explains why some people have more than one set.  I like this theory because i can point the finger at hubby especially when im very crampy and having alot of contractions.

Identical twins are not from hereditary genetics. Identical twins are caused by the egg splitting.  As far as me having multiple multiple pregnancies.....the odds are greater of having multiples again than a single birth.    --  Thanks and God Bless, Tiffany FTM to identical twins Trinity Dawn and Destiny Hope and FTM to step-daughters Allison Elizabeth and Carolyn Marie             Reply            Report this comment       0               / 2      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

I only have one open fallopian tube, so it was a shock to ovulate twice from the same side and have twins.

We went through the d&c procedure last week and thought of waiting for few months as we are still mentally shocked. We are very fond of having twins again but to my knowledge it doesn't run in our family. Is there a better chance of having twins again naturally? How to increase our chances of having twins again? Does a low dosage of clomid will give us twins? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  8 Posts k  kseds @taru84  It depends on a lot of factors. Your age, family history etc... You didn't say whether they were "fraternal" or "identical"....because it makes a difference. Fraternal twins are caused by "hyper ovulation" eg your ovaries releasing two or more eggs at ovulation. If that was the case, there is some small chance you could spontaneously conceive twins again. If identical, then it's completely random and there are no known causes or factors involved. To be honest your best shot at twins is via IVF - that will ensure 2 embryos are transferred - but it doesn't guarantee both will take or survive. Lastly, just be careful what you wish for... I ask you to spend even 10 minutes scrolling through and reading this board. There are countless stories of pre-eclampsia, pre term labour, premature rupture of membranes, gestational diabetes, Cholestasis, long NICU stays and even mortality. I lost my own twins a month ago at 20 weeks due to twin-specific complications. Twins are cute and fun but a multiple pregnancy is hard, stressful and dangerous. And life with twins is hard and stressful. Every mumma here feels lucky and blessed - but believe me when I say it's not all unicorns farting rainbows.... k  kseds @taru84  By the way I am very very sorry for your loss :( it is truly heartbreaking xx s  surgchick @kseds  Well said. R  RhiannonC Sorry for your loss. I agree with everything kseds said. I've read your chances of conceiving twins a second time increases if your first set were fraternal. Mine are di/di and more than likely fraternal, but I don't know of any twins in my family that I could have gotten the gene from. To just touch again on what she said, while the idea of twins is cool and all it is really no cake walk. I'm having a fairly easy pregnancy, but I have an almost 2 year old and I'm terrified of the newborn stage with two infants. I have seen too many moms lose one or both twins, just since I've been on this board, because of complications that they likely wouldn't have had had they been pregnant with one baby. I lost my first to a missed miscarriage so I can sympathize with you on a loss, but I would not recommend using a medication that you don't need just to try and get another set of twins. It took us 14 months of trying to get pregnant with our daughter and it was extremely stressful every month we failed to. Give yourselves time to grieve your losses and try again to get pregnant, with the hope of just getting pregnant period. s  shelleaschnelle @kseds  You're so awesome!! 4  4embies01 Well said kseds. I'm sorry for both of your losses and pray both of you will get pregnant again whether it's one or two. I recently found out that we were pregnant with twins and it was a shock to us. We always joked around having twins but it finally became a reality and then reading through this multiples thread and books, it became evident to me how much of a risk it can be for not only the babies but also myself. We were elated and ready for the challenge. We went through IVF and I've had two miscarriages prior so we were so happy and blessed to hear that we were pregnant with two miracles. Yesterday at my 8w1day ultrasound, we found out one of the twins may be a vanishing twin. I'll know better next week. We were both sad and happy at the same time as one of the babies was measuring perfectly and had a strong heartbeat. This is the furthest I have ever been in a pregnancy. Sometimes we are blessed with these miracles but I think whatever is meant to be whether you have one or two is a blessing. 4  4embies01 @wonka5  Wonka, thank you. Congrats also! It's been quite a journey for us.

M  MsRss25 Cori30, a may momma is having her second set of twins.. I've seen another mom too. I believe her name is doublebliss... T  Twoplustwins This may be tmi, but my hb decided to finish inside me without warning me.. I looked it up and he did it right smack in the middle of when I should be ovulating... my twins just turned 5 months old.. I guess i will find out in 9 days if im pregnant or not! Wish me luck! 3 under 13 months would be hard... 4 under 13 months.. would be harder! LOL C  Cori30 @Twoplustwins  I'm on my second set of twins, I have fraternal boys (age 3 1/2) and now 21w w/ fraternal girls, both conceived naturally.  T  Twoplustwins @Cori30  I have heard of lots of multiple sets of frats... wondering how likely I would be to have another set of ID... guess only time will tell! =) Congrats to you though! I love having twins... not as hard as everyone made it out to be! d  doulabliss Yep I'm on my second set of fraternal twins. My girls are 21 months now and I'm due with fraternal boys in June. Both spontaneous. I have a 4 year lid singleton too :) C  Cori30 @Twoplustwins  Good luck ;) And I agree, twins keep ya busy, but not nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be.  a  ajlf246 @Twoplustwins  Hey just thought I would share that I'm kinda in that situation, mine are a little older but not by much, and not exactly "twins". I had a daughter on Sept 27th 2008 & I wanted my second really close in age so I got pregnant again by December (when my first dd was 3-4 mos old). I had my son on Sept 28th, 2009 making them a year and a day apart exactly so pretty much Irish twins. Then this past April my hubby & I weren't even thinking about ovulating or babies or anything & sure enough, pregnancy #3 lol. I was okay with it, thinking one more would be fine. At twelve weeks along found out there were twins. So next Friday I'll be having my c-section to welcome our two new baby girls, and my kids will be two and a half, one and a half, and newborns. It will be a little hard at times & tiring I know but I love seeing how close my two kids are now & I know it'll be awesome as they grow up & all have each other. :) Let me know how it goes- you can look me up on Facebook if u want manderz_246@yahoo.com T  Twoplustwins @ajlf246  Congrats! You will be a busy bee won't you?? LOL I have 4, but they are 8,6 and 5 months.. not too bad.  I just have a feeling that i am going to be pregnant, but not sure yet obviously.. I am a little anxious.. I don't know what he was thinking.. but i have to admit that I am a tad excited! LOL We decided that if i am pregnant we wont tell a soul until i can't hide it anymore! And I will def look you up! Thanks Jen J  Jmhamilton3 @Twoplustwins  From everything I've read it is much more comman to have 2 sets of frats than 2 sets of idents. The egg splitting is random and the 2 eggs is not. So if you are pregnant, good chance it will be only one baby. Good luck! Your girls are adorable! T  Twoplustwins @Jmhamilton3  Thanks... I know that having two sets of id would be rare.. But wanted to see if anyone here has two sets.. Also I'm wondering if since I just started getting my period from being pregnant if I'd be more likely to be releasing two eggs.... I can test on the 8th.. Can't come soon enough!

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

Started by proudmumoftwingirls , Aug 27 2009 11:05 AM        Please log in to reply     10 replies to this topic            #1   proudmumoftwingirls    Posted 27 August 2009 - 11:05 AM    I gave birth to fraternal twin girls 4mths ago. They were conceived naturally. We are concidering having more children in the next few years, but are just wondering if the chances of conceiving twins again is higher once you have them. Also how long after having twins did you have more babies and how difficult was it? Both my husband and I are 26 and want to complete our family by the time we are 30. How much did everything change for you with 3. I am just thinking of the logistics of everything ie: new car will be needed unless we can fit 3 car seats in a Ford XR6. We have 2 safe n sound meridian car seats at the moment and I can only just fit between them.      Back to top                #2   nessrose    Posted 27 August 2009 - 12:56 PM    I'm a fraternal twin. I've had a singleton who is 4, then fraternal twins who are 2. I'm now 35 weeks pregnant with a singleton again. Your chances do increase if you've had fraternals before (about 4 times more likely than the average woman to have them again), however I guess it's the risk you have to take if you want more than 2. Did have me worried though so I know what you mean. Logistically you just learn to cope. We used a double pram with skateboard for DD1. She now walks though. Up until now we've had a Falcon Stationwagon which had plenty of room for kids, prams and groceries etc. We've now upgraded to a Tarago. I'm finding it great at the moment although at times challenging. Trying not to think about what it is going to be like having 4 under 4 and 2 months!  I guess it depends on the personality of your twins too, whether or not they are sleeping through the night etc. Even though this pregnancy wasn't exactly planned (although is very much wanted), my girls have been sleeping through the night since they were 5 months old so am not too worried about going through the whole newborn stage again. You are definitely bound to be more relaxed having had more than one before as well. Good luck.

Edited by becsj, 27 August 2009 - 04:15 PM.       Back to top                #4   gumby    Posted 27 August 2009 - 04:26 PM    Yes, if you naturally conceived fraternal twins, your chances of having them again are definitely very much increased.   Our frat twins were #3 & #4 and we are very much completed by them but if it helps, this is my 'gyno' history. DS#1 - Singleton M/C - Blighted ovum M/C - Twins M/C - Partial Molar preg DS#2 - Singleton DS#3 & DD1 - Twins From my own history, it would seem that I sometimes release two eggs.  If we were not finished with our family, we would definitely have to factor in the increased likelihood of multiples in any subsequent pregnancies. Good luck, you have adorable looking girls there       Back to top                #5   lustreless    Posted 27 August 2009 - 07:07 PM    My twins are also fraternal and naturally concieved, #2 and #3 I am pregnant with my second singleton since having my twins so I am here to assure you it probably won't happen again It was something I really worried about because I did not cope very well with my twins until they started school. I think out of all my years here on EB there is only one lady I know of that has had a second set of naturally conceived twins so its not as prevalent as the odds might make you believe. There have been a couple of others but those twins were results of fertility treatment. If you want another baby I say go for it, if you do have twins again it was obviously meant to be. PS - My twins were over 6 pounds each....how the hell did you carry two 8+ pound babies??       Back to top                #6   sarah-m    Posted 27 August 2009 - 07:21 PM    Oh wow, I'm just lurking here, but I too think the size of your girls is incredible and you went to term too!!! My DS was 8lb 1 oz and I was proud of myself cause I thought THAT was big       Back to top                #7   Phoebe2010    Posted 27 August 2009 - 08:03 PM    I'm another one gasping at your fabulous birth weights. I'm 9 weeks pregnant with twins and scared about low birth weight and associated problems - what was your secret?? Sorry I can't help with your question - these are my first.      Back to top                #8   proudmumoftwingirls    Posted 28 August 2009 - 03:05 PM    LOL A lot of people are astouded when I tell them that both my girls were over 8lb each when born. I am pretty god damn proud of myself that I got them to term. Believe me it was not easy carrying them especially the last month or two. I was hospitalised with back pain before birth and pretty much camped on the lounge for the last month or two of the pregnancy. I even rang when obstetrician crying one day a few weeks before they were born to deliver them early as I was in so much pain. Thank goodness he wouldn't do it as it gave them more time to grow and I am thankful for it now. I don't have a secret for it. I couldn't eat much while I was pregnant as the first 3mths I had 24/7 nausea (no vomitting though) so couldn't really eat. I craved milk for the last 4-5 months of my pregnancy so that may have contributed somehow I guess. I love having twins, but hated being pregnant with them so I wouldn't be disappointed if I ended up with another set once we decide to try again. Has anyone heard of twins this size or bigger? I know it's not that common. I might start a new topic finding out as it would be interesting to know. BECSJ - I have recovered great. I had a caesar so was uncomfortable for about 6wks, but not out of action. As with a natural birth aswell my hormones went crazy for about 3-4wks after the birth and I was pretty emotional about anything and everything, but got over it and I feel great these days. My girls are great and it has been so easy so far. Ask me again when they are moving about on their own lol.       Back to top                #9   Butterscotch    Posted 30 August 2009 - 08:40 AM    There's been a few threads on this which might be helpful (I recall starting a couple 2 or so years ago when we were trying to decide!), could pay to search or look back a few pages I had a similar dilemma when trying to decide whether or nto to have another baby after my twin daughters.  My girls are fraternal too.  As others have said, your chances of having twins again are higher than your average, but there's more chance you'd have a singleton (generally speaking, I can't say for certain for you personally as I do know of numerous cases of women having more than one set of naturally conceived multiples!  Some women are made to have multiples I guess! ) While we were trying to decide on whether or not to have another, God decided for us, and when Emily and Kailtyn were 20 months old I found myself pregnant!  I was VERY scared of having twins again.  We didn't have a good experience with pregnancy/birth/they were prem and never slept or fed well.  Lucky for us, we had a singleton.  There was 2yrs,4mths between them.  I would have liked a bigger age gap, but as they're all getting older I'm glad for a smaller one, so it's kinda short term pain, for long term gain.  I agree with a PP who said it depends a lot on the personality and habits of your kids, and the parents!  None of my kids have been good sleepers so that doesn't help... Oh.  And.  YES!  Am suitably impressed with your twin DD's weights How brilliant! (my two were 1.5 and 1.6kgs )   Edited by Butterscotch, 30 August 2009 - 08:41 AM.

(Seperate sacs and placentas but they look very similar!) We have just decided to start TTC our third and final child, but I keep wondering how we will manage if it is twins again! Not knowing whether the boys are identical leaves me unsure as to how high the chances are - I've heard it could be as high as a 1 in 4 chance of twins again if your first pregnancy resulted in fraternal twins. Of course, whatever will be will be and at least we've done it once before and know what to expect. But I still can't help thinking about it, and all the implications. Apart from anything else, the financial burden would just be so stressful! But then again, I adore having twins, seeing them interact makes my heart melt. Perhaps another set wouldn't be so bad..... So, anyone else share my concern???       Back to top                #2   puddina    Posted 24 May 2012 - 08:49 PM    yes it scares me having twins again....but not the raising 2 kids they whole twin pregnancy scares me, I don't think I could do the whole sick as a dog, premmies 10 weeks in hospital again. I want to try to number 3 but my partner shares my fears and concerns as well. Good luck with TTC #3      Back to top                #3   laurastwins    Posted 24 May 2012 - 08:59 PM    It did scare us but we tried again and got twins again lol. Then we had a bit of a surprise last year and yep it was twins again. The risk is there but it is worth it at the end of the day. I wouldn't change it for the world!     Back to top                #4   Mummyplusmemakes3    Posted 24 May 2012 - 09:01 PM    Glad I'm not the only worrier Puddina! Funnily enough I can hardly remember how bad the pregnancy was! I know it was awful, I know that every horrid pregnancy symptom you can get I got in spades, I know my waters broke at 29 + 6 and they were born by emergency c section at 30 + 3, but somehow I don't remember just how rough it was. I do remember crying a few times when I had to leave them in hospital each night after they were born (I never cry in public, I don't think my best friend has even seen me cry, so it stands out in my memory) but I still don't really remember how bad it felt. I guess that's why I'm potentially putting myself up for round two!!!       Back to top                #5   Mummyplusmemakes3    Posted 24 May 2012 - 09:05 PM    Holy moly laurastwins, are you saying you have three sets??? That's incredible!!!!! What lucky babies to have so many siblings       Back to top                #6   Threelittleducks    Posted 24 May 2012 - 09:14 PM    Yes,  I'm terrified. I adore my babies and love having twins. .... but given my health complications during pregnancy and that I know that we don't want four children, we have decided not to go for a third, in case we did end up with twins again. Is it worth getting your two tested to see if they are ID? It might help you decide. Cheers      Back to top                #7   laurastwins    Posted 24 May 2012 - 09:22 PM    Yep three sets they are 9,6 and 6 mths. It's hard work but they are fantastic.     Back to top                #8   Mummyplusmemakes3    Posted 24 May 2012 - 09:44 PM    Loulou I have thought about having them tested, but think I would still end up going for it anyway. While I do worry about the possibility, I'd rather two more than no more I think.      Back to top                #9   FurryTongue    Posted 24 May 2012 - 09:47 PM    I was pregnant with identical twins and sadly lost them. I have been told the chances of falling pregnant again with identical twins is 1 in 8. I am not sure if this is true. If it happened again I would be stoked but very apprehensive.

Hmmmm well if laurastwins can manage her amazing three sets I'm sure if we are blessed with two we will get by  Having said that, I can't even think up one name I'd like to use, let alone two!!!!! Haha      Back to top                #11   newyearbaby    Posted 25 May 2012 - 12:25 PM    I am 36+1 with DCDA twins, so I can remind you about the pregnancy side of things if you like. I've had a relatively straight forward pregnancy as far as twin pregnancies go, and I would not do this again in a million years!!! But my stress may have more to do with the fact that I have a 19 month old and a 3 year old to chase after, plus an 8 year old step son. And I'm not getting any younger either. This pregnancy has aged me more than the others. I've also been told that if we were to try again, chances are extremely high that I would have another twin pregnancy. So hubby is definitely getting the snip!! Don't get me wrong, I am very excited to meet my new boys in the next week. But it has been very hard work to make it mentally and physically to this stage. Good luck with whatever you decide...       Back to top                #12   nessrose    Posted 25 May 2012 - 06:49 PM    We were worried about having them again as I'm a fraternal twin too. We had a singleton, then twins, singleton, then fell pregnant with twins again. We lost one of them unfortunately. Just had our last 4 weeks ago. At times I'm glad we didn't have 2 again, but mostly I feel sad that our other little one didn't make it. Good luck whatever you decide.      Back to top                #13   Mummyplusmemakes3    Posted 28 May 2012 - 09:19 PM    Thanks guys for all the replies. I'm glad I'm not the only twin mum out there who thinks about the possibility! We have begun TTC again though, and will be very happy either way. Will simply try extra hard to win the lotto if necessary! Sunniedayz I neglected to say earlier how sorry I am that you lost your twins, I can't imagine how that felt and can certainly understand your feelings of apprehension. Thank you for sharing though       Back to top                #14   Becs    Posted 01 June 2012 - 07:30 PM    The thought of having severe morning sickness for 18+ weeks scared me more than the thought of having another set. If we could have guaranteed a singleton we would have gone back... Hats off to you Laurastwins! Are they ID or FRAT or both?     Back to top                #15   jill1972    Posted 04 June 2012 - 10:49 AM    Laurastwins, I nearly fainted when I read your post!!  You must have twins down pat! _____________     Back to top                #16   sharon4152    Posted 04 June 2012 - 11:00 AM    You can get your twins tested to see if they are ID or not. The other interesting thing is that you can have your cycle monitored via a fertility clinic.  They can see the number of follicles that are ready to release eggs each month.  If you show one follicle - then you can go for it.  If more then 1 then you might want to wait a month. Warning - some follicles contain one egg, some contain none, and some contain more then one egg.  So it's not fool proof or anything - but it is the way IUI (artificial insemination) is monitored at the fertility clinics and mostly there is only one egg per follicle. GoodLuck, S.     Back to top                #17   shoopdeboop    Posted 04 June 2012 - 11:11 AM    I have 10 yr old fraternal twins and am now pregnant with my 3rd child. I was so worried about having twins again I could not really enjoy the pregnancy until I found out. I was so relieved when they found one in there. I had a hard time bringing them up, and not in any medical way, just in a bringing babies/ young children up way and was mega worried of going through those younger years again with another two babies. Last thing I want in the world! I am so happy I am going to experience just having one!! After this one, I might be ok with falling pregnant with twins again if it happened, as I will have eased back into it with a singleton. But I have really really wanted to experience having just one baby and I'm so happy I'm  going to be able to have that!  :-)     Back to top                #18   Jackrabbit    Posted 26 June 2012 - 02:16 PM    We used assisted conception and got twins. Now we're going back to TTC #3. The risk is there that we will get twins again as too small a dose does nothing for me but a higher dose might make me release 2 eggs. My first pregnancy was a singleton though. I don't think I'd be devastated if I had twins again. In some ways it will be easier as I have a better idea of what I'm doing, but with the other 2 wanting attention too it will be harder whether it's one baby or two.

I have nearly 8 month old fraternal twin boys and I have been wondering and thinking about what the chances are of having twins again. Does anyone know? Is it higher the second time round then the first or makes no difference whether you have had twins before or not. I think about what I would do if I was to be pregnant again with twins. On one hand I think to myself there is no way I could do twins again especially with a set already then on the other hand I think well I've done it once and I don't know anything but raising two babies at once! I know that if I ever did have twins again, we would cope just like we are now. Anyway just interested in knowing :-) I still get so many strangers and even people I know saying to me 'gee you must have your hands full' or 'you must find it really tough with two' and I my reaction is always the same. 'To me is seems easy to raise twins because they are my first and I don't know any different. I don't know what its like to have only one baby to look after!

Back to top                #6   Breezles    Posted 17 October 2011 - 08:13 PM    I was told by a doctor there was a 1 in 4 chance of having twins again if you have conceived them before. I had a singleton (girl) at age 33 and then at 36 fell pregnant with fraternal twins who I then lost at 7 weeks. 8 months later after 4 months of trying I fell pregant again with frat twins and gave birth to healthy twin boys in April of this year. There is also a much higher chance of twins if you conceive between ages 34-39 (my case in point) as you are ovulating more eratically and might not ovulate one month and then pop out two eggs the next month. I also had a family history on my maternal side which is another strong indicator. My husband is having a vasectomy soon as he is certain we will fall pregnant with another set if we were to try for number 4!! Definitely agree having a singleton after twins would be easier! I notice a big difference when I've just got 1 of the twin babies with me as opposed to 2. I highly recommend having them spaced 3 years plus as twin toddlers and an infant would be challenging. My daughter is a huge help to me at age 4 and I don't think I would have coped as well with a demanding toddler & newborn twins.

If I'm a fraternal twin?  Started by Cyaira , Aug 08 2011 06:15 PM        Please log in to reply     9 replies to this topic            #1   Cyaira    Posted 08 August 2011 - 06:15 PM    Hello all, I am sure this question has been asked before but after googling this question I have seen all sorts of mixed statistics! So my question is this: If I'm a female, fraternal twin - what are my chances of having twins? (IVF excluded?) What factors contribute to fraternal twins? Can someone explain the genetics of this to me? Hyper-ovulation?? If relevant, my mother had us at 37 and it was her fourth pregnancy. We  were not conceived via IVF. My mother has twins on both her mother and  father's side. I have loved being a twin and would love to have a set of twins. I have been told I have the highest chance of naturally having twins out of any statistics but I'm unsure if it's true. That said, I would love ANY child I had. It's mostly out of curiosity I ask.     Back to top                #2   bronzzeAngel    Posted 08 August 2011 - 06:20 PM    I have heard that sometimes the older the mum, the higher the chances of having twins. I do know that my mum lost twin boys between me and my sister and her age would of been around 38 to 41 at the time. though even though that said, they can run in families     Back to top                #3   Sammitty    Posted 08 August 2011 - 08:24 PM    From what i understand as you have the gene you will throw two eggs as you get older. My gran is fraternal and my mum is also fraternal.  Mum didn't have twins which we believe is likely to e because she stopped having kids at 26. I am 31 this year and have fraternal twins due in march, naturally no assistance. You are also more likely with subsequent births, but i don't know if tha is just because you are older.  That s what i have found out anyway and it rings true for us.  Good luck!      Back to top                #4   RedsGirl    Posted 08 August 2011 - 09:07 PM    I have also heard your chances of twins increases as you get older. My maternal Nana also had fraternal twins and she must have been at least 40, as they were her last two babies.  My aunt on my Dad's side also had fraternal twins and she would have been mid-late 30s. I had also heard it can skip a generation, but not sure how true that is - may be an old wives tale.      Back to top                #5   trdl    Posted 08 August 2011 - 09:16 PM    I think you have a higher chance of having twins if you are a fraternal twin yourself. My husband is an identical twin and its said that the chances of us having twins are quite low. Unless fraternal runs through my mothers side. My sister had fraternal twins at 19. We are trying for another baby and i would just love to have a set of twins. DH is not so sure      Back to top                #6   Cyaira    Posted 08 August 2011 - 09:51 PM    Thanks for the responses, now I'm intrigued and have been thinking... If Sammitty is correct about genes that throw eggs twice then I think I can see why it skips a generation... The gene must be in a female for it to work (understandably, since men can't ovulate) but males can pass it on. So my mother passes the gene on to my brother.. my brother's wife won't have twins but their daughters might because he passed the gene on to them. It's not an exact skip in this case but it could happen!

I had my heart on having twins with pregnancy no 2, and had a gorgeous girl. With pregnancy no 3, twins were the last thing on my mind, so of course, you can guess what happened lol.     Back to top                #8   Becs    Posted 08 August 2011 - 10:27 PM    Yes you should have a slightly higher chance as you are a fraternal twin.. I keep telling my fraternal twins that I can't wait for them to have their own set... Insert evil laugh here... Any woman aged over 37  and has more than 3 children is naturally at a higher chance of hyper-ovulation resulting in fraternal twins. I remember how many Dr's/midwives commented on our naturally conceived set as I was 29 when I fell pregnant. They said is was quite uncommon for that age group.     Back to top                #9   Ciel    Posted 08 August 2011 - 10:38 PM    I think the current statistics in Australia are that the chance of having fraternal twins is about 1:70.  But this is the average chance - it is lower if you are in your 20's, higher once you get older than about 35 (and once you are 45 or older, your chance of having twins is 17%!  (~1:6!). then, if your mother or sister had fraternal twins, your underlying chance is doubled QUOTE The rate of dizygotic twinning is increased in women aged 35–39 years,  with higher parity and tall stature. Rates fall in severely malnourished  women. Dizygotic twinning runs in families. If a mother or a sister has  dizygotic twins, a woman has double the risk of having dizygotic twins  herself. If she has dizygotic twins herself, her risk of having future  dizygotic twins is quadrupled So, overall, your chance is twice the average, and will increase with age (though obviously this is offset by reduced fertility)     Back to top                #10   nessrose    Posted 11 August 2011 - 09:36 AM    I'm a fraternal twin. So far we've had a singleton, fraternal twins, singleton. We must be due now for another set of twins.!

I have no known family history of twins either and no fertility tx/meds ever. My husband always jokes we would end up with triplets if we had another pregnancy. Odds are higher than the general population for another set of fraternals. I guess the only way to find out is to try for another baby. Just kinda freaks me out that there are even moms that don't have a strong family history of multiples and no fertility treatments end up with two sets. Amazing!!! Congrats!

This is because most women who conceive fraternals (without fertility drugs) show a pattern of releasing more than one egg per cycle. Your chance of a second set numerically, is about 1 in 3000 The odds of having one set of identicals and one set of fraternals is 1 in 10,000. If a woman has one set of identicals, her chance of having another is 1 in 70,000 or less. The odds of having 3 sets of twins, of any kind, is 1 in 500,000.

Most likely the 2nd and maybe even 3rd pregnancy would be singles. twins after twins typically occur 2-3 pregnancies apart. I had b/g twins Feb 2009 and when I found out Nov 2009 I was pregnant again, I freaked out and spoke to a specialist and he assured me that, although it is possible, it is not very likely at all. He said to beware though the next pregnancy. Some people say that they can ONLY have twins, but even this is not true. It may be true that they ONLY ovulate multiple eggs but that does not even mean that each egg will be fertilized and implant. The chances of even one ovulated egg being fertilized and implanting to become and embryo is still not 100% so much less so is it that 2 or more would be. That is another reason twins are not so common as singletons. You should be fine. Of course, as everything else in life, it is never guaranteed, but your chances are tremendously higher of having a single birth this time around. But like my specialist told me...if you have another after this one, don't be surprised to see 2 again! GL! oh and by the way, I am only having 1 this time! (So I have done my part and added to that statistic)          Helpful     Nice     Funny     Encouraging  (2)    Hugs             Chelle -  posted on 05/11/2010   133  74  11   I have just had my second set of fraternal twins they are 3 months old now and my other set are 8 yrs old i have heard a lot of people have a singleton afterward and then twins after that as well i guess its weather you ovulate 2 eggs each time the odds are there ..best of luck :)          Helpful     Nice     Funny     Encouraging  (1)    Hugs                    Join Circle of Moms  Sign up for Circle of Moms and be a part of this community!

Identical: no increase in probability of having another set.  Fraternal:  definitely a higher probability.  1 in 12 cited below is about right.

Which is a true statement but not as hard as most people make it out to be. I think if you want more kids don't let the thought of having more multiples scare you. If you believe in God pray and tell him your worries. He will help you get through anything. Nothing is to big or small. As moms we always figure out a way to get through what ever comes we are built this way. If you live near family get them involved. and never let the negative attitudes prevail in your life. You may hear you are crazy to have more. But truth be told they are just scared they couldn't do it and if you do you are better than they are. I am tired a lot, but I think if you ask any mom they will also say they get tired. My kids are young and back to back. Most of the time I get asked if I have triplets. But in all honesty I am happy they are close in age because my girls are the best of friends. My son is amazing. Not going to lie it is a lot of work but if you are up fro it then go for it.

Fraternals do increase your chances but not as much as you may think.  I was told it's about 10% more likely on your next pregnancy, which is pretty much what Destiny said.

They (the twins) will be 18 months old when Annabelle is born. I was nervous in the beginning that it would be twins again bc we were not planning to get pregnant so soon in the first place, but my doctor, who is a multiples specialist, said that your chances DO increase after having twins, but not for the next 2 pregnancies so much. He said it is very unlikely to have twins directly following twins. Also, a lot of people think that your chances of having twins go up to 40% but he also said that that number is not accurate. Your chances only go up to 1 in 12 which is about 8%. It is drastically more than the initial (I think it was) 1.3% everyone has in the beginning, but it is still not HIGHLY likely. Just MUCH MORE likely. But 8% is worth the risk, in my oppinion. If you have twins first, then after you have 2 single births, though, then your chances will increase to 40% and he said that is where that number comes from. Also, these statistics are for people who conceive fraternal twins ONLY and only conceiving them naturally. So if identicals are any part of it then your chances are still EXTREMELY low and if they were assisted reproduction of any sort, then they are counted differently as well.

If I recall correctly, your chances of twins again are pretty high if you had conceived them naturally (vs IVF) as you probably release more than one egg each cycle.

The doctor told me that every time that I will fall pregnant it will be twins. I will never carry a singleton only might have triplets if I try again.

I've got twins after twins.  =D  But, we weren't trying for any more kids at all. In fact, we had such a hard time getting pg the first time that we just didn't take any precautions at all.  Surprise!   Our first twins were IVF (after 6 years)... and the 2nd set are an identical surprise.   I absolutely love it -- and you would, too. So, no need to fear!
