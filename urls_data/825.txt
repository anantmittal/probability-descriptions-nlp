         Hole in one   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   This article is about the golf shot. For other uses, see Hole in one (disambiguation) .  In golf , a hole in one or hole-in-one (also known as an ace , mostly in American English ) occurs when a ball hit from a tee finishes in the cup. This awards the player a score of one for the hole, but not if the player is making a second shot from the tee due to a lost ball, out of bounds or water hazard.  Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one are considered to also contain an element of luck . [1] [2] As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an albatross ). [3] As of October 2008 [update] , a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5]  Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in disc golf . The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 Big Sky State Games at Diamond X Disc Golf Course, revered as one of the most difficult and unique courses in the world, located in Billings, Montana .

[6] It is traditional for a player who has scored a hole in one to buy a round of drinks for everyone at the clubhouse bar. [7]  Among the memorable holes in one, one occurred in the 1973 British Open when at age 71, Gene Sarazen made a hole in one. Earl Dietering of Memphis, Tennessee, 78 years old at the time, is believed to hold the record for the oldest person to make a hole-in-one twice during one round. [8]  During the second round of the 1971 Martini International tournament, held at the Royal Norwich Golf Club in England, John Hudson had two consecutive holes in one. Teeing off, using a 4-iron, at the par-three, 195-yard 11th hole, Hudson holed his tee shot for a hole-in-one. At the next hole, the downhill 311-yard, par-four 12th, and this time using a driver, he once again holed his tee shot, for another ace. This is believed to be the only time a player has scored holes-in-one at consecutive holes in a major professional tournament. [9] [10]  Despite the relative rarity of holes in one, there have been a total of six in Ryder Cup matches. Peter Butler scored the first in 1973 at Muirfield followed by a 20-year gap before Nick Faldo scored a hole in one in 1993 . Two years later , Costantino Rocca and Howard Clark both scored holes in one before an 11-year gap to 2006 saw Paul Casey and Scott Verplank both hole out in one on the 14th hole. [11]  On August 11, 2016, Justin Rose shot a hole in one during the first round of the golf tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which is considered to be the first one in the Olympic history. For the 189 yards 3-par hole, he used a 7-iron. [12]  Competitions [ edit ]  Occasionally special events host a hole in one contest, where prizes as expensive as a new car, or cash awards sometimes reaching $4 million are offered if a contestant records a hole in one. [13] Usually such expensive prizes are backed by an insurance company who offers prize indemnification services . Actuaries at such companies have calculated the chance of an average golfer making a hole in one at approximately 12,500 to 1, and the odds of a tour professional at 2,500 to 1. [6]  Holes-in-one on par 5 (or higher) holes [ edit ]        This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  (September 2016)     As of October 2008, a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5] A horseshoe-shaped par 5 hole once enabled a condor hole in one to be achieved with a 3-iron club. [4] [5] The longest recorded straight drive hole-in-one is believed to be 517 yards or 473 metres, on the par 5 No. 9 hole at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in Denver in 2002, aided by the thin air due to the high altitude. [4] [5] None of these four par 5 holes-in-one were achieved during a professional tournament. [4] A condor is also known as a double albatross, or a triple eagle. [4] [5]  Kim Jong-il myth [ edit ]  Over a period of several years, many U.S. and European media outlets – including ESPN and the New York Times [14] – reported that former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il was claimed to have shot five holes in one during his first attempt at playing golf (an alternate version of the story claims North Korean media once reported Kim had shot 18 holes in one). This is explained as a case of the North Korean government assigning supernatural feats of heroism to its leaders as part of an effort to perpetuate a cult of personality . This myth was originally published by Eric Ellis, a reporter for the Australian Financial Review , as having been told by a Pyongyang Golf Club professional in 1994. [15]  NK News reports that "informal surveys of North Koreans themselves revealed that no one in Pyongyang was aware of this legendary feat, unless told it by a tourist." [16] Richard Seers, a British journalist who played at the Pyongyang Golf Club asked officials there, who revealed it was nothing more than an urban myth.

According to a 2004 article in Golf World magazine, Lynch aimed straight toward the green on a horseshoe par-5, clearing a 20-foot-high hedge, then hitting a downslope on the other side.

Acing a hole is a golfer's ultimate dream, which requires great skill and lots of luck. Check out these facts and records on golf's toughest shot.K  Longest Hole In One  The longest straight shot hole in one in golf history was hit by Robert Mitera on October 7, 1965 at the Miracle Hills Golf Club in Omaha, Nebraska . Mitera used his driver to ace the 10th hole from 444 yards! Mitera couldn't even see the flag from where he teed off. He only realized he'd aced the hole when he arrived at the green and another golfer told him his ball was in the hole.  Oldest and Youngest Golfers  Some golfers play for years without shooting a hole in one, while others manage to do it at an early age. The youngest player was barely out of diapers when he shot his first hole in one. Jake Paine was just three years old when he shot a hole in one on a 65 yard hole in Lake Forest, California . The oldest player is Harold Stilson , from Boca Raton, Florida . He was 101 years old when he aced the 108 yard 16th hole with a four iron at the Deerfield Country Club on May 16, 2001.  Most Hole In Ones Norman Manley , of California , holds the record for most hole in ones with 59. Manley shot his first hole in one in 1964 and aced four holes in 1979. That's not too bad considering the odds of hitting a hole in one are roughly one in 40,000.  Famous First Hole In Ones  Tiger Woods was six years old when he hit his first hole in one. Michelle Wie has had six hole in ones in her short golfing career. Wie shot her first ace when she was 12.  Useless Piece of Golf Trivia  Ted Hoz of Baton Rouge, Lousiana, USA, has collected 69,384 golf balls since 1986. If the balls were set in a line side by side, they would extend almost 2 miles (3.2 km).  Related Stories:   Man Vs.

TAGS:  Hole-In-One-News     A hole- in-one occurs when the ball is hit from the tee into the cup and stays there. (The last bit might seem a tad pedantic, but I know of one chap who hit the ball into the hole on the full, but it bounced out and rolled into a greenside lake.) A hole-in-one is also known, albeit less commonly, as an ace.  To count as a true hole-in-hole a couple of criteria have to apply. The first is that you are not alone; you can be playing alone, but someone has to be there marking your card to testify to your feat. The second is that it is part of a formal round of golf, not just part of a few practice holes.   Golfing tradition dictates that any golfer who makes a hole in one buys the drinks afterwards. Who he buys for can vary upon whatever local tradition exists as the club. The most widespread one is that the golfer buys a drink for his playing partners after the round and also a drink for everyone else in the clubhouse or bar when he returns.  Had a Hole In One Recently? Join our Hole-In-One Club        Thus a hole in one can become mightily expensive if you happen to hit a busy time in the bar. Some people therefore believe it acceptable if the hole-in-oner only buys for his playing partners, but others look deeply askance at such an attitude.        However some clubs have a local policy such as that the golfer puts some money behind the bar by way of a tab and when that is used up, that is the end of his obligation. Others have a tradition that the player just buys a large bottle of whisky which then sits on the bar counter for anyone to help themselves to a tot from.  Some insurance companies offer hole-in-one insurance whereby the maker of a hole-in-one gets a stated pay out by the company. Often this is bundled in as part of a more general golf accident insurance policy.

(See List of golfers with most PGA Tour wins .)  Woods has won 14 majors , second all time , behind Jack Nicklaus.  Woods is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead.  Woods scoring average in 2000 is the lowest in PGA Tour history, both adjusted, 67.79, and unadjusted, 68.17. [1]  Woods has the lowest career scoring average in PGA Tour history.  Woods has amassed the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history (even after inflation is considered).  Woods is one of five players (along with Gene Sarazen , Ben Hogan , Gary Player , and Jack Nicklaus ) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so. [2]  Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons. This feat became known as the "Tiger Slam".  Woods set the all-time PGA Tour record for most consecutive cuts made, with 142. The streak started in 1998, he set the record at the 2003 Tour Championship with 114 (passing Byron Nelson 's previous record of 113 and Jack Nicklaus at 105) and extended this mark to 142 before it ended on May 13, 2005 at the EDS Byron Nelson Championship . Many consider this to be one of the most remarkable golf accomplishments of all time, given the margin by which he broke the old record and given that during the streak, the next longest streak by any other player was usually only in the 10s or 20s. [3] [4] [5] [6] It should be noted that when Byron Nelson played far fewer players made the cut in a given event. [ citation needed ]  Woods has won a record 25.2% (79 out of 313) of his professional starts on the PGA Tour.  Woods is the only golfer to have won the U.S. Amateur three consecutive times (1994–96).   Awards records [ edit ]   Woods has been the PGA Player of the Year a record eleven times.  Woods has been the PGA Tour Player of the Year a record eleven times.  Woods has been the PGA Tour Money Leader a record ten times.  Woods has been the Vardon Trophy winner a record nine times.  Woods has been the recipient of the Byron Nelson Award a record nine times.   Miscellaneous [ edit ]   Woods owns a 54–4 record when holding at least a share of the lead after 54 holes, [7] and 42–2 record when holding the outright lead. [8]  Woods has only lost once when leading by more than one shot after 54 holes. Yang Yong-eun began the final round of the 2009 PGA Championship two strokes behind Woods and defeated him by three strokes.  Woods has a 37–11 record when leading after 36 holes in Tour events, including an 8–3 record in majors. [7]  Woods has won 12 tournaments wire-to-wire, including seven times while holding the lead outright after each round: 2000 U.S. Open , 2000 PGA Championship (tied after 1st and 4th rounds), 2000 WGC-NEC Invitational , 2002 Bay Hill Invitational (tied after 1st round), 2002 U.S. Open , 2002 WGC-American Express Championship , 2003 Western Open , 2005 Open Championship , 2005 WGC-NEC Invitational (tied after 1st, 2nd and 3rd rounds), 2006 Ford Championship at Doral (tied after 2nd round), 2006 WGC-American Express Championship , 2013 WGC-Cadillac Championship (tied after 1st round)  Woods has successfully defended a title 24 times on the PGA Tour, has finished runner-up 29 times, and third place 19 times.  Woods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings.  Woods holds the PGA Tour record for most consecutive rounds at par or better with 52. The streak began in the second round of the 2000 GTE Byron Nelson Classic and ended in the second round of the 2001 Phoenix Open. When including non-PGA Tour events, the streak was 66. [9]  Woods' win at the 2005 Open Championship made him only the second golfer (after Nicklaus) to have won all four majors more than once. With his win in the 2008 U.S. Open, Woods joined Nicklaus as the only golfers to win each major at least three times.  Woods holds at least a share of the scoring record in relation to par in one major (The Masters), and also holds the margin of victory record in two majors (The Masters and the U.S. Open).  Woods' victory at the 2006 WGC-American Express Championship , he became the first player in PGA Tour history to win at least eight times in three different seasons.  Woods' victory in the Buick Invitational in January 2007 placed him 2nd for the longest PGA Tour win streak at 7 (consecutive wins in PGA events entered), trailing only Nelson's streak of 11 wins in 1945.  Woods became the first golfer to win five PGA Tour events five or more times at the 2009 BMW Championship. In order of his accomplishment: WGC-CA Championship, WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, Buick Invitational, Arnold Palmer Invitational, and BMW Championship.  Woods' win at the U.S. Open in 2008 made him the sixth person to win the U.S. Open three or more times, the first person to win a PGA Tour tournament on the same course seven times, and the first person to win two tournaments at the same golf course in the same season.  Woods has hit a combined total eighteen holes-in-one in the course of his lifetime—his first at the age of six. Three have come in PGA Tour competition, at the 1996 Greater Milwaukee Open, 1997 Phoenix Open, and 1998 Sprint International. [10]  Woods is the only professional golfer to win four majors in a row.

He has had the outright lead or a share of the lead 11 times at the end of the second round and has only lost three times.  Woods holds at least a share of the record for lowest 72-hole score in relation to par in one of the four majors. Note that the "to par" and "low 72-holes" records are not always the same because, while most championship golf courses have a par of 72, or 288 for four rounds, some have a par of 71 or 70.  Woods is the only player to have won multiple professional majors in consecutive years, 2005 and 2006. Bobby Jones won multiple majors in consecutive years in 1926 and 1927, when the U.S. Amateur and the British Amateur were both considered majors. [11]  Woods has won two or more majors in a year four times. He trails only Jack Nicklaus , who won two majors in a season five times (1963, '66, '72, '75 and '80). [12]    Woods, Nicklaus , Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler are the only players to have finished in the top 5 in all four majors in a year. Woods and Nicklaus have both achieved this twice: Woods in 2000 and 2005, and Nicklaus in 1971 and 1973. Fowler joined the list in 2014 and Spieth in 2015.  Woods and Bobby Jones are the only golfers to have won 10 majors before the age of 30. Jones achieved 13 majors in 21 attempts, (winning percentage 62%), while Woods achieved 10 wins in 44 attempts (a 23% winning ratio). [13]    Woods is only the second player all-time to win three major championships in a calendar year (2000) winning the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship respectively, along with Ben Hogan who accomplished this feat in (1953) with The Masters, the U.S. Open, and The Open Championships.  Woods is the second player to have won the career grand slam three times along with Jack Nicklaus . Woods is the only professional golfer to win four majors in a row.  The last: Masters (2005), US Open (2000), Open Championship (2005), and PGA (2000), Jack Nicklaus played in; were all won by Tiger Woods.   Masters Tournament [ edit ]   −18 (270), 1997 (outright to-par and low 72 holes record), tied by Jordan Spieth in 2015  Woods holds the record for the largest margin of victory at the Masters: 12 strokes (1997)  Woods became the youngest winner in 1997 at the age of 21 years, 104 days  His win made him the first winner of The Masters, or any other (under-50) men's major, of African or Asian descent. He, the Indian Fijian  Vijay Singh , and the South Korean  Yang Yong-eun are the only winners of any major of such descent. The only other major winner whose primary ethnic heritage is undeniably non-European is 2005 U.S. Open champion Michael Campbell , a Māori from New Zealand.  After a front-nine 40 in the first round, Woods played the final 63 holes 22-under par  He played 72 holes without a single three-putt  Woods set a record with the lowest back-to-back total for two rounds: 131 (65-66)   U.S. Open [ edit ]   Woods holds the record for the largest margin of victory at the U.S. Open: 15 strokes (2000) (this is the record for all majors).  Also in 2000, Woods became the first player to finish a U.S. Open at double digits under par. (In 1992, Gil Morgan was the first ever to be double digits under par at any stage of a U.S. Open, but failed to finish in double digits under par, and indeed failed to win that event, with Tom Kite winning instead.)  Woods was the only player to finish under par at the following U.S. Opens:  2000 at Pebble Beach Golf Links : -12  2002 at Bethpage State Park, Black Course : -3    With his win in 2008 , Woods equaled Jack Nicklaus' feat of winning each major at least three times.   The Open Championship [ edit ]   Woods shares the record for largest margin of victory at a post-1900 Open Championship: 8 strokes (2000)  Woods became the fifth player to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the youngest player (24 years, 206 days) to do so, breaking the mark held by Nicklaus (26 years, 6 months at the 1966 British Open)  He became the fastest to win all four majors – in his 93rd sanctioned tournament, compared with 125 for Nicklaus  He became the youngest to win a fourth major championship, breaking the mark held by Nicklaus (25 years, 80 days at the 1965 Masters)  In 2006, Woods became the first player to win the Open Championship in back-to-back years since Tom Watson in 1982–83  He became the first golfer since Watson in 1982 to win the U.S. and British Opens in the same year   PGA Championship [ edit ]   With his 2006 PGA Championship win, Woods became the only golfer to have won all 4 majors by at least 5 strokes  Woods is the only player in the stroke-play era (since 1958) to repeat as PGA champion.  Woods' wins at Medinah in 1999 and 2006 make him the only player to win the PGA Championship twice on the same course.  Second round 63 in the 2007 PGA Championship tied the record for second lowest single-round score in major championship history  Woods is the only player to win the PGA Championship back-to-back on two different occasions: 1999–2000 and 2006–2007.

All-time wins leader in World Golf Championships events (41.9% win rate).  All-time money leader in World Golf Championships events.  Won the WGC-World Cup with David Duval in 2000, an unofficial money WGC event, for a total of 19 World Golf Championships titles.  Only player to have held the titles of all three of the pre-2009 events (not counting the HSBC Champions, elevated to WGC status in 2009) at the same time.   Accenture Match Play   Woods set the record for most lopsided victory (18-hole match) in his first round match against Stephen Ames in 2006 – 9 & 8. Mathematically, it is the fastest possible win in 18-hole match play (10 & 8 would be a larger margin of victory, but the same number of holes played).  Woods also set the record for largest margin of victory in the 36-hole final match – 8 & 7 over Stewart Cink in 2008.   Cadillac Championship   Lowest first 18-hole total 63 set the course record at The Grove  Tied lowest first 18-hole total – 63  Lowest 36-hole total – 127  Largest 36-hole lead – 5 strokes  Lowest 54-hole total – 194  Largest 54-hole lead – 6 strokes  Lowest 72-hole total – 261  Largest margin of victory – 8 strokes  Only player to record top-10 finishes in each appearance (more than two appearances)   Note: All Cadillac Championship records were set in 2006, when the tournament was known as the American Express Championship [14]  Bridgestone Invitational   Lowest 18-hole total – 61 (twice, tied with José María Olazábal )  Lowest 36-hole total – 125  Lowest 54-hole total – 192  Lowest 72-hole total – 259  Largest margin of victory – 11 strokes   Note: All records were set in 2000 and 2013 (18-hole record)  Results timeline [ edit ]    Tournament  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014    Accenture Match Play Championship  QF  2  DNP  R64  1  1  R32  R16  R16  1  R32  DNP  R64  R32  R64  DNP    Cadillac Championship  1  T5  NT 1  1  1  9  1  1  1  5  T9  DNP  T10  WD  1  T25    Bridgestone Invitational  1  1  1  4  T4  T2  1  1  1  DNP  1  T78  T37  T8  1  WD    HSBC Champions   T6  T6  DNP  DNP  DNP  DNP    1 Cancelled due to 9/11 DNP = Did not play QF, R16, R32, R64 = Round in which player lost in match play "T" = tied NT = No Tournament WD = Withdrew Green background for wins.

Next year, the LPGA western section championship will take place here. The ladies will play from the front tees, which measure a considerable distance from the cup at 500 yards. The longest hole is #9, at 777 yards, par 6.    By Laura Castellano           updated 10/4/2007 11:47:36 AM ET  2007-10-04T15:47:36      Print   Font:   +  -     It has the makings of a publicity stunt, but having one of the longest golf holes in America is also about pride. Course owners and golf pros are pleased to divulge the yardage of their longest hole, from back tee to cup. And, when asked, most add with a hint of uncertainty, “I think we have the longest hole, right?” and then, reassuringly: “It’s really not as hard as it looks.”  Another slightly comforting piece of information when there is no sign of a flag down the fairway: On most of these holes, you can take one more swing than usual to get your ball onto the green. The USGA guidelines are such that any hole 691 yards and longer from the back tees or 591 and longer from the ladies’ tees can be considered a par 6. If you have never heard of a par 6, you are not alone; there are very few of them in the U.S., but most courses with that kind of yardage take advantage of the extra swing (seven of our top ten are par 6), although some golfers don’t need it.  One man playing at the longest hole at Meadows Farms in Locust Grove, Virginia double eagled the 841-yard hole, sinking it in three shots. “He was a long hitter,” general manager Bobby Lewis said. “We were shocked, but we did verify it.”  Bill Meadows, aka “Farmer,” conceived of the longest hole in the late 1990s. At first, the course designer was skeptical, but when he realized it would be a challenge, he went with it. “You have to design it so it’s not something golfers dread,” said Bill Ward Jr., designer of Meadow Farm’s longest hole, as well as a couple of other par 6 holes. “That’s the hardest part—make it look very difficult, but have it be relatively easy.”  Who is it not easy for? Landscapers. The upkeep of a long hole is expensive. Chocolay Golf Club in Marquette, Michigan has had a 1007-yard hole “laid out” for over three years. Golf pro Dennis Kargela said he is not sure if the novelty of it would bring in enough business to cover maintenance costs. The hole would require 50 sprinkler heads and a few 50-pound bags of fertilizer. Aerating it would take twice as long as any of their other holes. “We’re considering reshaping and cutting it down for that reason,” he said.  Veteran record holders at this point, the Meadow Farms landscaping team has managed. “Other than the fairway being long, and so much more to cut, it’s a great hole,” said Meadow Farms’ superintendent Bucky Wheeler, who has been mowing, and playing, the hole for 14 years. “I’ve birdied it before, but I took a ten on it before too. It hurt me to write that ten on the scorecard.”         © www.gallerygolf.com   The longest par 5 in the U.S., (#9 at 725 yards) the Gallery in Marana, Arizona, was designed by John Fought and British Open Champion, Tom Lehman. Two 18-hole courses, North and South, make up this picturesque course that sits among cacti and is surrounded by red canyons.  Though Chocolay Golf Club threatens to take the record, it seems Meadow Farms is safely number one. For now, this is the list of longest holes in the U.S., based on the National Golf Foundation’s available data, which is derived from a list of over 12,000 public and private courses in the United States.

Well, here they are By  Keely Levins Share this story: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn By Luke Kerr-Dineen Making a hole-in-one is hard. Really hard. How hard? Golf Digest has been tracking data on that subject for more than 60 years, and now, the National Hole In One Association , answers that question with this handy infographic (now would probably be a good time to look away if you haven't had one already). Related: Golf Digest's hole-in-one primer The data below were collected by the HIO over the course of 30 years through their hole-in-one insurance plans. And before you even ask, hole-in-one insurance exists because groups hosting small golf events usually offer expensive prizes to competitors who make an ace as a way of boosting participation. They'll take out a plan just in case they find themselves in the unlikely situation of having to pony-up a car on short notice. But anyway, back to business. An amateur golfer's chance of an ace is 12,500 to 1? Yikes.

By T.J. Auclair PGA.com Connect with T.J.  Series: Golf Buzz   Published: Wednesday, September 13, 2017 | 12:53 p.m.          When it comes to a hole-in-one, an albatross or, even a condor -- more on that coming , if you don't know what it is -- us golfers know they're all extra special.  But just how special are they? Like, what are the odds?  Let's take a look at the three most coveted scores in golf and try to explain...   1. A hole-in-one or ace  According to the National Hole-in-One Registry , the odds of the average golfer making a hole-in-one are 12,000 to 1 .  The National Hole-in-One Registry also has a boatload of other great facts regarding an ace...  - The odds of a Tour player making an ace: 3,000 to 1 - The odds of a low-handicapper making an ace: 5,000 to 1 - The odds of two players from the same foursome acing the same hole: 17 million to 1 - The odds of one player making two holes-in-one in the same round: 67 million to 1  The National Hole-in-One Registry also says that there are roughly 450 million rounds of golf played each year in the U.S., or approximately 25,000-30,000 per course. Each of those courses reports between 10-15 aces per year. That means a hole-in-one is scored once in every 3,500 rounds. Only 1-2 percent of golfers score an ace in a year. The average years of playing golf for a player before making an ace is 24. Can you believe that?   RELATED: Take a closer look at the PGA Tour's 30 aces in the 2016-17 season  Further, the average handicap of a golfer making a hole-in-one is 14. That should prove encouraging for a lot of folks. You clearly don't have to be the best player on the course... you just have to be the luckiest, once.  The age group that makes the most holes in one? That would be golfers between 50-59, which account for 25 percent of aces each year. The next highest percentage age group consists of players between 40-49, who account for 24 percent of annual aces.  Sixteen percent of holes in one are made by women, according to the National Hole-in-One Registry. The average age of a female golfer making an ace is 55, with an average of 15 years playing the game. And the average length of hole for a woman making an ace is 111 yards.   2. An albatross or double eagle  An albatross is achieved when a player either aces a par 4, or scores a "2" on a par 5.   The Double Eagle Club , which touts itself as, "the worldwide registry for double eagles scored," features a story from former longtime Golf World writer Bill Fields, that states the odds of an albatross are an estimated 6 million to 1 .   RELATED: Nine times an albatross was caught on video  But, Fields writes:   Dean Knuth, who was senior director of the handicap department at the USGA from 1981 to 1997 and now a Golf Digest contributing editor, says they're lower than that but still great, about a million-to-one shot.  That makes your chances of becoming one of the couple of hundred golfers a year to make a double eagle (as opposed to 40,000 aces) better than being killed by a shark (1 in 350 million) or dying from a dog bite (one in 18 million) but worse than being struck by lightning (one in 555,000) or, for a woman, having quadruplets without the aid of fertility drugs (one in 729,000).  "They're definitely far more rare than aces," Knuth says. "Someone has to hit two great shots. You have to have length and ability. Only a small percentage of golfers, less then 10 percent, ever reach a par 5 in two. That means 90 percent of golfers don't have a chance of making one."   Imagine that. You have a better chance to be struck by lightning than you do of making an albatross.   3. A condor  First of all, have you ever even heard of a condor? We're not talking about the bird -- a vulture -- but the absolute rarest shot in golf. It's a "1" on a par 5, which believe it or not, has actually been done.   RELATED: 9 golf mysteries, including where the mulligan came from, explained  According to www.golf.co.uk , there have been four condors recorded -- all ones on par 5s, but never a "2" on a rare par 6.  From www.golf.co.uk:   The first occurred in 1962, when Larry Bruce drove into the hole over a stand of trees on the 480-yard dogleg right par-5 fifth hole at Hope Country Club in Arkansas, USA.  Another condor was achieved by "cutting the corner" of a dogleg par-5 by Shaun Lynch at Teign Valley Golf Club in Christow, England, in 1995, on the 496-yard 17th. Lynch aimed straight at the green with a 3-iron, clearing a 20-foot-high hedge and hitting a downslope on the other side, which allowed his ball to roll down to the green and into the hole.  A condor was scored without cutting over a dogleg by Mike Crean at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in Denver, Colorado, in 2002, when he holed his drive at the 517 yard par-5 9th. This is longest hole in one on record, although it was of course aided by the altitude and thin air of 'mile-high' Denver.  The most recent condor was achieved in Australia by 16-year-old Jack Bartlett on the 467 metre par-5 17th at Royal Wentworth Falls Country Club, NSW, Australia, on November 3, 2007.   A condor is so uncommon in golf that bookmakers don't even offer odds on such a feat.  So how did "condor" become a part of golf lingo? It's believed that the only explanation is a continuation of the 'bird' theme for under-par scores with the size of the bird getting bigger as the score gets lower, hence "birdie," "eagle," "albatross," "condor."

The Rules of Golf do not address the issue of the validity of a hole in one. The USGA recommends that a hole in one be considered valid:   If made during a round of at least nine holes, except that a hole in one made during a match should be acceptable even if the match ends before the stipulated round is completed  If the player is playing one ball; a hole in one made in a practice round in which the player is playing two or more balls should not be acceptable  If attested by an acceptable witness  If made at a hole with a temporary tee and/or putting green in use, even if the Committee did not specifically define the teeing ground with tee-markers; the length of the hole at the time should be stated on any certificate  If made in a “scramble” competition, for example, a Captain’s Choice       What is the chance that a golfer will make a hole in one?    Tour player making an ace: 3,000 to 1  Low-handicapper making an ace: 5,000 to 1  Average player making an ace: 12,000 to 1  Two players from the same foursome acing the same hole: 17 million to 1  One player making two holes-in-one in the same round: 67 million to 1       Other hole-in-one facts    There are approximately 450 million rounds of golf played each year in the U.S  On average each course has about 25,000 – 30,000 rounds played each year  Each course reports 10-15 hole in ones each year  A hole in one is scored once every 3,500 golf rounds  Odds of making a hole in one is 1:3500  Only 1-2% of golfers score a hole in one during the year  Average years of playing is 24  Average handicap of golfers making hole in one is 14  Age group that makes the most holes in one is 50-59 (25%) and the next highiest is 40-49 (24%)  Ball used most often is Titleist (45%), Nike (14%), and Top Flite (11%)  A Hole in One on a par four is called an Albatross       Facts just for women    16% of holes in one are made by women  Average age is 55  Average years of playing is 15  Average hole length is 111 yards          Download Our Infographic                      Copyright © 2017 NationalHoleInOneRegistry.com.

For other uses, see Hole in one (disambiguation) .  In golf , a hole in one or hole-in-one (also known as an ace , mostly in American English ) occurs when a ball hit from a tee finishes in the cup. This awards the player a score of one for the hole, but not if the player is making a second shot from the tee due to a lost ball, out of bounds or water hazard.  Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one are considered to also contain an element of luck . [1] [2] As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an albatross ). [3] As of October 2008 [update] , a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5]  Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in disc golf . The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 Big Sky State Games at Diamond X Disc Golf Course, revered as one of the most difficult and unique courses in the world, located in Billings, Montana .

[6] It is traditional for a player who has scored a hole in one to buy a round of drinks for everyone at the clubhouse bar. [7]  Among the memorable holes in one, one occurred in the 1973 British Open when at age 71, Gene Sarazen made a hole in one. Earl Dietering of Memphis, Tennessee, 78 years old at the time, is believed to hold the record for the oldest person to make a hole-in-one twice during one round. [8]  During the second round of the 1971 Martini International tournament, held at the Royal Norwich Golf Club in England, John Hudson had two consecutive holes in one. Teeing off, using a 4-iron, at the par-three, 195-yard 11th hole, Hudson holed his tee shot for a hole-in-one. At the next hole, the downhill 311-yard, par-four 12th, and this time using a driver, he once again holed his tee shot, for another ace. This is believed to be the only time a player has scored holes-in-one at consecutive holes in a major professional tournament. [9] [10]  Despite the relative rarity of holes in one, there have been a total of six in Ryder Cup matches. Peter Butler scored the first in 1973 at Muirfield followed by a 20-year gap before Nick Faldo scored a hole in one in 1993 . Two years later , Costantino Rocca and Howard Clark both scored holes in one before an 11-year gap to 2006 saw Paul Casey and Scott Verplank both hole out in one on the 14th hole. [11]  On August 11, 2016, Justin Rose shot a hole in one during the first round of the golf tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which is considered to be the first one in the Olympic history. For the 189 yards 3-par hole, he used a 7-iron. [12]  Competitions [ edit ]  Occasionally special events host a hole in one contest, where prizes as expensive as a new car, or cash awards sometimes reaching $4 million are offered if a contestant records a hole in one. [13] Usually such expensive prizes are backed by an insurance company who offers prize indemnification services . Actuaries at such companies have calculated the chance of an average golfer making a hole in one at approximately 12,500 to 1, and the odds of a tour professional at 2,500 to 1. [6]  Holes-in-one on par 5 (or higher) holes [ edit ]        This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  (September 2016)     As of October 2008, a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5] A horseshoe-shaped par 5 hole once enabled a condor hole in one to be achieved with a 3-iron club. [4] [5] The longest recorded straight drive hole-in-one is believed to be 517 yards or 473 metres, on the par 5 No. 9 hole at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in Denver in 2002, aided by the thin air due to the high altitude. [4] [5] None of these four par 5 holes-in-one were achieved during a professional tournament. [4] A condor is also known as a double albatross, or a triple eagle. [4] [5]  Kim Jong-il myth [ edit ]  Over a period of several years, many U.S. and European media outlets – including ESPN and the New York Times [14] – reported that former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il was claimed to have shot five holes in one during his first attempt at playing golf (an alternate version of the story claims North Korean media once reported Kim had shot 18 holes in one). This is explained as a case of the North Korean government assigning supernatural feats of heroism to its leaders as part of an effort to perpetuate a cult of personality . This myth was originally published by Eric Ellis, a reporter for the Australian Financial Review , as having been told by a Pyongyang Golf Club professional in 1994. [15]  NK News reports that "informal surveys of North Koreans themselves revealed that no one in Pyongyang was aware of this legendary feat, unless told it by a tourist." [16] Richard Seers, a British journalist who played at the Pyongyang Golf Club asked officials there, who revealed it was nothing more than an urban myth.

This is explained as a case of the North Korean government assigning supernatural feats of heroism to its leaders as part of an effort to perpetuate a cult of personality . This myth was originally published by Eric Ellis, a reporter for the Australian Financial Review , as having been told by a Pyongyang Golf Club professional in 1994.

For other uses, see Hole in one (disambiguation) .  In golf , a hole in one or hole-in-one (also known as an ace , mostly in American English ) occurs when a ball hit from a tee finishes in the cup. This awards the player a score of one for the hole, but not if the player is making a second shot from the tee due to a lost ball, out of bounds or water hazard.  Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one are considered to also contain an element of luck . [1] [2] As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an albatross ). [3] As of October 2008 [update] , a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5]  Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in disc golf . The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 Big Sky State Games at Diamond X Disc Golf Course, revered as one of the most difficult and unique courses in the world, located in Billings, Montana .

[6] It is traditional for a player who has scored a hole in one to buy a round of drinks for everyone at the clubhouse bar. [7]  Among the memorable holes in one, one occurred in the 1973 British Open when at age 71, Gene Sarazen made a hole in one. Earl Dietering of Memphis, Tennessee, 78 years old at the time, is believed to hold the record for the oldest person to make a hole-in-one twice during one round. [8]  During the second round of the 1971 Martini International tournament, held at the Royal Norwich Golf Club in England, John Hudson had two consecutive holes in one. Teeing off, using a 4-iron, at the par-three, 195-yard 11th hole, Hudson holed his tee shot for a hole-in-one. At the next hole, the downhill 311-yard, par-four 12th, and this time using a driver, he once again holed his tee shot, for another ace. This is believed to be the only time a player has scored holes-in-one at consecutive holes in a major professional tournament. [9] [10]  Despite the relative rarity of holes in one, there have been a total of six in Ryder Cup matches. Peter Butler scored the first in 1973 at Muirfield followed by a 20-year gap before Nick Faldo scored a hole in one in 1993 . Two years later , Costantino Rocca and Howard Clark both scored holes in one before an 11-year gap to 2006 saw Paul Casey and Scott Verplank both hole out in one on the 14th hole. [11]  On August 11, 2016, Justin Rose shot a hole in one during the first round of the golf tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which is considered to be the first one in the Olympic history. For the 189 yards 3-par hole, he used a 7-iron. [12]  Competitions [ edit ]  Occasionally special events host a hole in one contest, where prizes as expensive as a new car, or cash awards sometimes reaching $4 million are offered if a contestant records a hole in one. [13] Usually such expensive prizes are backed by an insurance company who offers prize indemnification services . Actuaries at such companies have calculated the chance of an average golfer making a hole in one at approximately 12,500 to 1, and the odds of a tour professional at 2,500 to 1.

Other golfers go their whole golfing careers without one. Just how hard is it to make a hole-in-one ? Exactly what are the odds? Let's take a look at the odds of a "basic" hole-in-one plus some less likely scenarios. (Note on sources: Unless otherwise noted in the text, primary sources are the calculations of Boston University mathematician Francis Scheid, Ph.D., on behalf of Golf Digest ; and National Hole in One, which provides hole-in-one insurance for tournaments.)         Standard Hole-In-One Odds for Amateurs and Pros What are the odds of any given golfer holing out from the tee on a par-3 hole ? Your typical hole-in-one, in other words (as opposed to some of the extraordinary circumstances we'll see below). It partially depends on how good the golfer is. Making an ace includes a heavy dose of luck, but the better you are, the more likely it is you'll eventually get one (because you are hitting more shots onto the green, more balls closer to the hole). Odds of an amateur making a hole-in-one: 12,500 to 1 Odds of a low-handicapper making a hole-in-one: 5,000 to 1 Odds of a professional golfer making an ace: 2,500 to 1 Odds for an average golfer on a 200-yard par-3: 150,000 to 1 Odds of Making a Hole-in-One In Your Lifetime What are the odds of recording at least one ace over the span of a golfer's playing career? If you are a low-handicapper and play 1,000 rounds in your life (an average of 25 rounds for 40 years), you have a 20-percent chance of making at least one hole-in-one.   How many rounds do you have to play to make the odds even - 1:1? If you're a low-handicapper who plays 5,000 rounds (100 rounds a year for 50 years), you're even-money to have at least one ace. (Obviously, the odds are much higher for average golfers.) Hole-in-One Odds for a Group of Golfers Much, much rarer than one golfer making one ace during a round of golf is two golfers from the same group making aces during the same round.         Odds of two golfers in the same group of four making holes-in-one at any point during the round: 1.3 million to 1 Odds of two golfers in the same group of four acing the same hole during the same round: 26 million to 1 The odds are much better, however, for a field of average golfers. According to US Hole In One (which provides hole-in-one insurance), with a field of 100 amateurs on a golf course that has four par-3 holes, there is a 1-in-32 chance someone will make an ace during that event. (Odds of a hole-in-one during the four days of a PGA Tour event, according to the same outfit, are 1:1.) Even More Extraordinary Aces and the Hole-in-One Odds We've told the stories of some amazing aces here, and, of course, you can find many more stories out there on the web at large. Holes-in-one that are so unusual, their odds must be astronomical. To cite a few: In 1971 a European Tour pro aced back-to-back holes (one of which was a par-4) in a tour event . Odds: 50 million to 1. A husband-and-wife duo aced the same hole on back-to-back swings. Odds: Who knows! So rare it hasn't been (perhaps can't be) calculated. A beginning golfer who'd never even birdied made two holes-in-one in five holes. Odds: Get outta here with that crazy talk!  (But it really happened - instructor Rick Smith saw them both.) The odds of one player making two aces in the same round have been calculated at 67 million-to-1.  At the 1989 U.S. Open , four pros aced the same hole (No. 6) during the same round (second).  Odds: 1.6 million to 1 (much lower than you might expect because these guys are so good).

According to Carlos Concha, General Manger with Hole In One International, “the odds of making a hole in one on a par 3 are roughly 1 in 13,000 for amateurs and 1 in 2,500 for professionals.”  Sure, those figures may seem a bit daunting… but if your tournament has an average of 100 amateur players and your golf course or country club has a total of four par 3 holes, the odds of someone in your tournament acing one of those holes is approximately 1 in 32.  Now that’s more like it!  Plus, you can rest easy knowing that whenever hole in one insurance is purchased through Hole In One International, we automatically include up to 4 smaller auxiliary prizes for all players to shoot for (shootouts excluded).  That gives you extra chances at acing a hole during your tournament!  But what about the odds of two people making it on the same hole?  Or better yet, back-to-back hole in ones?  According to Concha, 32,000 to 1 and 156,250,000 to 1, respectively.

While picking an outright winner is a method most bettors are familiar with, one of the more interesting ways to get involved is with the numerous prop bets that sportsbooks are offering.  Many people are familiar with prop bets surrounding the Super Bowl, but golf props can be unfamiliar territory. These Masters props can range from simple things—such as who the top amateur will be at the end of tournament—to more exotic, with bets like will a hole-in-one occur or what the cut line will be after Friday. There’s a plethora of possibilities that allow an adventurous bettor to have more fun watching this upcoming major. It's no joy to lose, which is why expert golf handicapper Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com was asked to send over his top prop selections for this upcoming major.  While it’s always a thrill to see who comes away with the green jacket on Sunday, it could be fun—not to mention lucrative—to play these prop bets in the 2017 Masters. Here's a quick look at the schedule for the tournament, as well as a few of Price's best prop picks for the event:         2017 Masters Schedule  Live Coverage (ET)  TV Network  Live Stream    Thursday, April 6  3 p.m.  ESPN  WatchESPN    Friday, April 7  3 p.m.  ESPN  WatchESPN    Saturday, April 8  3 p.m.  CBS  CBSSports.com    Sunday, April 9  2 p.m.  CBS  CBSSports.com           Top Lefty: Phil Mickelson (-165), Bubba Watson (+120), Mike Weir (+5000)          UNIVERSITY PLACE, WA - JUNE 18: (L-R) Bubba Watson of the United States and Phil Mickelson of the United States shake hands on the 18th hole during the first round of the 115th U.S. Open Championship at Chambers Bay on June 18, 2015 in University Place, Washington. (Photo by Andrew Redington/Getty Images)      The course at Augusta National seems to be made for lefties to dominate. It’s hard to dispute this when six winners since 2003 are southpaws. Mickelson, the game’s most famous lefty—hence his nickname—is responsible for three of those victories. The Arizona State product came away with wins in 2004, 2006 and 2010. Watson added two green jackets to his closest recently, claiming them in 2012 and 2014. Weir started the run on left-handed winners with his surprise victory in 2003.  For the purposes of this prop, throw Weir out. His odds would pay massive dividends on a small wager, but there is little chance the 46-year-old earns a win on Sunday. His only career major was that aforementioned Masters victory 14 years ago, but his performances in recent years have left much to be desired. He’s only made the cut once since 2011, a T-44 finish in 2014.  Mickelson is the odds-on favorite for this prop, but the aging golfer would need to defy father time to contend for a win. Jack Nicklaus became the oldest person to win a green jacket, when he turned back the clock in 1986 to win at 46-years-old. Mickelson, also 46, has a few months on the Golden Bear going into this tournament. Lefty has been playing well leading up to the first major of the season—he has yet to miss a cut—but he’s also coming off two cuts in his past three attempts at the Masters.  Watson seems to be the best bet here, as the 38-year-old hasn’t missed a cut at Augusta since 2010. While he hasn’t played too well in the past two tourneys, he was able to make it into the weekend. Factor in his two championships and you are looking at one of the most consistent players in this event. With +120 odds, Watson is certainly the right play for this prop.  Pick: Bubba Watson (+120)  Will There Be a Hole-In-One: Yes (-140), No (+110)         AUGUSTA, GEORGIA - APRIL 10: Davis Love III of the United States celebrates his hole in one on the 16th green as Webb Simpson of the United States looks on during the final round of the 2016 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club on April 10, 2016 in Augusta, Georgia. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)      After last year’s hole-in-one bonanza, it’s very tempting to bet on another happening in 2017. In the 2016 tournament, Shane Lowry, Davis Love III and Louis Oosthuizen all made aces on the 16 th hole. This incredible run on hole-in-ones tied the tournament record, which was original set back in 2004.  However, a quick look at the history of aces at Augusta reveals that they aren’t exactly that common—especially in back-to-back years. While there were hole-in-ones in consecutive tournaments in 2012 and 2013, as well as 2004 and 2005, you would have to go all the way back to the first and second ever Masters events in 1934 and 1935 to find it happening a third time.  It’s somewhat surprising that the odds for no hole-in-ones are better than if there is. That may be because the public is rooting for them to happen and were dazzled by the trio of aces in last year’s tournament. Don’t bet with your heart and take the smart bet of an ace-free Masters in 2017.  Pick: No Hole-In-One (+110)   Cut Line: 148 & Under (+700), 149-150 (+165), 151 & Over (-150)  Making the cut at Augusta National is always tough, and this year projects to be even tougher than usual—at least according to the odds. Vegas is expecting that the cut line will fall at 151 or over based on the odds given, while 149-150 wouldn’t be a big surprise either. However, those that believe this will be a low-scoring affair have the longest odds with a cut line of 148 or under in the 2017 Masters.  For those that aren’t familiar, since 2013 the cut has been established as those who fall in the top 50 places—including ties—or within 10 strokes of the leader’s score after 36 holes. In last year’s event, the cut was 150, which would fall right in the middle of this prop. However, in the three Masters preceding that—all utilizing the 2013 and beyond cut rules—the line fell at 146 and 148 twice.  With odds that pay 7-to-1, this looks to be one of the top prop bets one can make on the 2017 Masters. While the weather could certainly make an impact, take recent history into account and lock up the value before tee-time on Thursday.  Pick: 148 & Under (+700)       ABOUT THE AUTHOR        Alex Kay     Contributor   i                 Follow      I've been working in the realm of sports my entire career, starting as a breaking news writer right out of Arizona State University.

What Are The Odds of Making a Hole In One?    Even though the odds of a hole in one from 150 yards away are slim, it does happen. Actually, it happens more often than you would think. There are a number of websites that provide statistics about the chances of an amateur player getting a hole in one. The majority of these website statistics are unreliable.  Some believe that the chances of getting a hole in one are 10,000 to 1. Others claim that the odds are 100,000 to 1. Because our business is based around knowing these statistics, we guarantee that we know the real chances of this occurring. This knowledge also allows us to determine the probability of these events occurring at your tournament.  What are the actual odds of making a hole in one on a par 3 hole for an amateur?  The odds are 12,500 to 1. For professional golfers, the odds drop to 2,500 to 1. Knowing this information allows us to figure out the chances of someone making a hole in one during your tournament. If your event has 100 amateur participants and the golf course has four par 3 holes, the odds of a player making a hole in one are 1 in 32. The chance of a participant hitting an ace no longer seems impossible, does it?  If you are hosting a professional tournament , the probability of a golfer making an ace increases. The average PGA tournament has 144 professional golfers. The odds of a golfer making a hole in one during a day of golfing are 1 in 4.5. The means that the chances of a golfer making a hole in one during a four-day PGA Tour tournament are 1 in 1. It can certainly pay to be a skilled golfer.  You have probably heard stories of two players making an ace at the same event on the same hole. Realistically, the odds of this happening are slim. Statistically, there is a 32,000 to 1 chance of this occurring. Maybe you have also heard the tale of the professional golfer that hits three consecutive holes in one during the same tournament. The chances of a golfer getting three consecutive aces on a par 3 course are 156,250,000 to 1. A golfer has a better chance of winning the Powerball lottery than accomplishing three consecutive holes-in-one.  Either way the odds and the event are what creates true excitement, and a hole-in-one is a memory that will last forever.            24/7 Service  Throughout the golf season  (888)-527-6944  CustomerCare@HIO.com    Or Get A Quote Online, Click Here    Need Golf Signs?

For other uses, see Hole in one (disambiguation) .  In golf , a hole in one or hole-in-one (also known as an ace , mostly in American English ) occurs when a ball hit from a tee finishes in the cup. This awards the player a score of one for the hole, but not if the player is making a second shot from the tee due to a lost ball, out of bounds or water hazard.  Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one are considered to also contain an element of luck . [1] [2] As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an albatross ). [3] As of October 2008 [update] , a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5]  Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in disc golf . The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 Big Sky State Games at Diamond X Disc Golf Course, revered as one of the most difficult and unique courses in the world, located in Billings, Montana .     Contents    1  Rarity  2  Competitions  3  Holes-in-one on par 5 (or higher) holes  4  Kim Jong-il myth  5  See also  6  References  7  External links     Rarity [ edit ]  Holes in one are rare, and, although skill definitely increases the probability, there is a great element of luck involved. [6] It is traditional for a player who has scored a hole in one to buy a round of drinks for everyone at the clubhouse bar. [7]  Among the memorable holes in one, one occurred in the 1973 British Open when at age 71, Gene Sarazen made a hole in one. Earl Dietering of Memphis, Tennessee, 78 years old at the time, is believed to hold the record for the oldest person to make a hole-in-one twice during one round. [8]  During the second round of the 1971 Martini International tournament, held at the Royal Norwich Golf Club in England, John Hudson had two consecutive holes in one. Teeing off, using a 4-iron, at the par-three, 195-yard 11th hole, Hudson holed his tee shot for a hole-in-one. At the next hole, the downhill 311-yard, par-four 12th, and this time using a driver, he once again holed his tee shot, for another ace. This is believed to be the only time a player has scored holes-in-one at consecutive holes in a major professional tournament. [9] [10]  Despite the relative rarity of holes in one, there have been a total of six in Ryder Cup matches. Peter Butler scored the first in 1973 at Muirfield followed by a 20-year gap before Nick Faldo scored a hole in one in 1993 . Two years later , Costantino Rocca and Howard Clark both scored holes in one before an 11-year gap to 2006 saw Paul Casey and Scott Verplank both hole out in one on the 14th hole. [11]  On August 11, 2016, Justin Rose shot a hole in one during the first round of the golf tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which is considered to be the first one in the Olympic history. For the 189 yards 3-par hole, he used a 7-iron. [12]  Competitions [ edit ]  Occasionally special events host a hole in one contest, where prizes as expensive as a new car, or cash awards sometimes reaching $4 million are offered if a contestant records a hole in one. [13] Usually such expensive prizes are backed by an insurance company who offers prize indemnification services . Actuaries at such companies have calculated the chance of an average golfer making a hole in one at approximately 12,500 to 1, and the odds of a tour professional at 2,500 to 1. [6]  Holes-in-one on par 5 (or higher) holes [ edit ]        This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  (September 2016)     As of October 2008, a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5] A horseshoe-shaped par 5 hole once enabled a condor hole in one to be achieved with a 3-iron club. [4] [5] The longest recorded straight drive hole-in-one is believed to be 517 yards or 473 metres, on the par 5 No. 9 hole at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in Denver in 2002, aided by the thin air due to the high altitude. [4] [5] None of these four par 5 holes-in-one were achieved during a professional tournament. [4] A condor is also known as a double albatross, or a triple eagle. [4] [5]  Kim Jong-il myth [ edit ]  Over a period of several years, many U.S. and European media outlets – including ESPN and the New York Times [14] – reported that former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il was claimed to have shot five holes in one during his first attempt at playing golf (an alternate version of the story claims North Korean media once reported Kim had shot 18 holes in one). This is explained as a case of the North Korean government assigning supernatural feats of heroism to its leaders as part of an effort to perpetuate a cult of personality . This myth was originally published by Eric Ellis, a reporter for the Australian Financial Review , as having been told by a Pyongyang Golf Club professional in 1994. [15]  NK News reports that "informal surveys of North Koreans themselves revealed that no one in Pyongyang was aware of this legendary feat, unless told it by a tourist." [16] Richard Seers, a British journalist who played at the Pyongyang Golf Club asked officials there, who revealed it was nothing more than an urban myth.

Acing a hole is a golfer's ultimate dream, which requires great skill and lots of luck. Check out these facts and records on golf's toughest shot.K  Longest Hole In One  The longest straight shot hole in one in golf history was hit by Robert Mitera on October 7, 1965 at the Miracle Hills Golf Club in Omaha, Nebraska . Mitera used his driver to ace the 10th hole from 444 yards! Mitera couldn't even see the flag from where he teed off. He only realized he'd aced the hole when he arrived at the green and another golfer told him his ball was in the hole.  Oldest and Youngest Golfers  Some golfers play for years without shooting a hole in one, while others manage to do it at an early age. The youngest player was barely out of diapers when he shot his first hole in one. Jake Paine was just three years old when he shot a hole in one on a 65 yard hole in Lake Forest, California . The oldest player is Harold Stilson , from Boca Raton, Florida . He was 101 years old when he aced the 108 yard 16th hole with a four iron at the Deerfield Country Club on May 16, 2001.  Most Hole In Ones Norman Manley , of California , holds the record for most hole in ones with 59. Manley shot his first hole in one in 1964 and aced four holes in 1979. That's not too bad considering the odds of hitting a hole in one are roughly one in 40,000.  Famous First Hole In Ones  Tiger Woods was six years old when he hit his first hole in one. Michelle Wie has had six hole in ones in her short golfing career. Wie shot her first ace when she was 12.  Useless Piece of Golf Trivia  Ted Hoz of Baton Rouge, Lousiana, USA, has collected 69,384 golf balls since 1986. If the balls were set in a line side by side, they would extend almost 2 miles (3.2 km).  Related Stories:   Man Vs.

TAGS:  Hole-In-One-News     A hole- in-one occurs when the ball is hit from the tee into the cup and stays there. (The last bit might seem a tad pedantic, but I know of one chap who hit the ball into the hole on the full, but it bounced out and rolled into a greenside lake.) A hole-in-one is also known, albeit less commonly, as an ace.  To count as a true hole-in-hole a couple of criteria have to apply. The first is that you are not alone; you can be playing alone, but someone has to be there marking your card to testify to your feat. The second is that it is part of a formal round of golf, not just part of a few practice holes.   Golfing tradition dictates that any golfer who makes a hole in one buys the drinks afterwards. Who he buys for can vary upon whatever local tradition exists as the club. The most widespread one is that the golfer buys a drink for his playing partners after the round and also a drink for everyone else in the clubhouse or bar when he returns.

Some people therefore believe it acceptable if the hole-in-oner only buys for his playing partners, but others look deeply askance at such an attitude.        However some clubs have a local policy such as that the golfer puts some money behind the bar by way of a tab and when that is used up, that is the end of his obligation. Others have a tradition that the player just buys a large bottle of whisky which then sits on the bar counter for anyone to help themselves to a tot from.  Some insurance companies offer hole-in-one insurance whereby the maker of a hole-in-one gets a stated pay out by the company. Often this is bundled in as part of a more general golf accident insurance policy.

(See List of golfers with most PGA Tour wins .)  Woods has won 14 majors , second all time , behind Jack Nicklaus.  Woods is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead.  Woods scoring average in 2000 is the lowest in PGA Tour history, both adjusted, 67.79, and unadjusted, 68.17. [1]  Woods has the lowest career scoring average in PGA Tour history.  Woods has amassed the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history (even after inflation is considered).  Woods is one of five players (along with Gene Sarazen , Ben Hogan , Gary Player , and Jack Nicklaus ) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so. [2]  Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons. This feat became known as the "Tiger Slam".  Woods set the all-time PGA Tour record for most consecutive cuts made, with 142. The streak started in 1998, he set the record at the 2003 Tour Championship with 114 (passing Byron Nelson 's previous record of 113 and Jack Nicklaus at 105) and extended this mark to 142 before it ended on May 13, 2005 at the EDS Byron Nelson Championship . Many consider this to be one of the most remarkable golf accomplishments of all time, given the margin by which he broke the old record and given that during the streak, the next longest streak by any other player was usually only in the 10s or 20s. [3] [4] [5] [6] It should be noted that when Byron Nelson played far fewer players made the cut in a given event. [ citation needed ]  Woods has won a record 25.2% (79 out of 313) of his professional starts on the PGA Tour.  Woods is the only golfer to have won the U.S. Amateur three consecutive times (1994–96).   Awards records [ edit ]   Woods has been the PGA Player of the Year a record eleven times.  Woods has been the PGA Tour Player of the Year a record eleven times.  Woods has been the PGA Tour Money Leader a record ten times.  Woods has been the Vardon Trophy winner a record nine times.  Woods has been the recipient of the Byron Nelson Award a record nine times.   Miscellaneous [ edit ]   Woods owns a 54–4 record when holding at least a share of the lead after 54 holes, [7] and 42–2 record when holding the outright lead. [8]  Woods has only lost once when leading by more than one shot after 54 holes. Yang Yong-eun began the final round of the 2009 PGA Championship two strokes behind Woods and defeated him by three strokes.  Woods has a 37–11 record when leading after 36 holes in Tour events, including an 8–3 record in majors. [7]  Woods has won 12 tournaments wire-to-wire, including seven times while holding the lead outright after each round: 2000 U.S. Open , 2000 PGA Championship (tied after 1st and 4th rounds), 2000 WGC-NEC Invitational , 2002 Bay Hill Invitational (tied after 1st round), 2002 U.S. Open , 2002 WGC-American Express Championship , 2003 Western Open , 2005 Open Championship , 2005 WGC-NEC Invitational (tied after 1st, 2nd and 3rd rounds), 2006 Ford Championship at Doral (tied after 2nd round), 2006 WGC-American Express Championship , 2013 WGC-Cadillac Championship (tied after 1st round)  Woods has successfully defended a title 24 times on the PGA Tour, has finished runner-up 29 times, and third place 19 times.  Woods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings.  Woods holds the PGA Tour record for most consecutive rounds at par or better with 52. The streak began in the second round of the 2000 GTE Byron Nelson Classic and ended in the second round of the 2001 Phoenix Open. When including non-PGA Tour events, the streak was 66. [9]  Woods' win at the 2005 Open Championship made him only the second golfer (after Nicklaus) to have won all four majors more than once. With his win in the 2008 U.S. Open, Woods joined Nicklaus as the only golfers to win each major at least three times.  Woods holds at least a share of the scoring record in relation to par in one major (The Masters), and also holds the margin of victory record in two majors (The Masters and the U.S. Open).  Woods' victory at the 2006 WGC-American Express Championship , he became the first player in PGA Tour history to win at least eight times in three different seasons.  Woods' victory in the Buick Invitational in January 2007 placed him 2nd for the longest PGA Tour win streak at 7 (consecutive wins in PGA events entered), trailing only Nelson's streak of 11 wins in 1945.  Woods became the first golfer to win five PGA Tour events five or more times at the 2009 BMW Championship. In order of his accomplishment: WGC-CA Championship, WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, Buick Invitational, Arnold Palmer Invitational, and BMW Championship.  Woods' win at the U.S. Open in 2008 made him the sixth person to win the U.S. Open three or more times, the first person to win a PGA Tour tournament on the same course seven times, and the first person to win two tournaments at the same golf course in the same season.  Woods has hit a combined total eighteen holes-in-one in the course of his lifetime—his first at the age of six. Three have come in PGA Tour competition, at the 1996 Greater Milwaukee Open, 1997 Phoenix Open, and 1998 Sprint International. [10]  Woods is the only professional golfer to win four majors in a row.

He has had the outright lead or a share of the lead 11 times at the end of the second round and has only lost three times.  Woods holds at least a share of the record for lowest 72-hole score in relation to par in one of the four majors. Note that the "to par" and "low 72-holes" records are not always the same because, while most championship golf courses have a par of 72, or 288 for four rounds, some have a par of 71 or 70.  Woods is the only player to have won multiple professional majors in consecutive years, 2005 and 2006. Bobby Jones won multiple majors in consecutive years in 1926 and 1927, when the U.S. Amateur and the British Amateur were both considered majors. [11]  Woods has won two or more majors in a year four times. He trails only Jack Nicklaus , who won two majors in a season five times (1963, '66, '72, '75 and '80). [12]    Woods, Nicklaus , Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler are the only players to have finished in the top 5 in all four majors in a year. Woods and Nicklaus have both achieved this twice: Woods in 2000 and 2005, and Nicklaus in 1971 and 1973. Fowler joined the list in 2014 and Spieth in 2015.  Woods and Bobby Jones are the only golfers to have won 10 majors before the age of 30. Jones achieved 13 majors in 21 attempts, (winning percentage 62%), while Woods achieved 10 wins in 44 attempts (a 23% winning ratio). [13]    Woods is only the second player all-time to win three major championships in a calendar year (2000) winning the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship respectively, along with Ben Hogan who accomplished this feat in (1953) with The Masters, the U.S. Open, and The Open Championships.  Woods is the second player to have won the career grand slam three times along with Jack Nicklaus . Woods is the only professional golfer to win four majors in a row.  The last: Masters (2005), US Open (2000), Open Championship (2005), and PGA (2000), Jack Nicklaus played in; were all won by Tiger Woods.   Masters Tournament [ edit ]   −18 (270), 1997 (outright to-par and low 72 holes record), tied by Jordan Spieth in 2015  Woods holds the record for the largest margin of victory at the Masters: 12 strokes (1997)  Woods became the youngest winner in 1997 at the age of 21 years, 104 days  His win made him the first winner of The Masters, or any other (under-50) men's major, of African or Asian descent. He, the Indian Fijian  Vijay Singh , and the South Korean  Yang Yong-eun are the only winners of any major of such descent. The only other major winner whose primary ethnic heritage is undeniably non-European is 2005 U.S. Open champion Michael Campbell , a Māori from New Zealand.  After a front-nine 40 in the first round, Woods played the final 63 holes 22-under par  He played 72 holes without a single three-putt  Woods set a record with the lowest back-to-back total for two rounds: 131 (65-66)   U.S. Open [ edit ]   Woods holds the record for the largest margin of victory at the U.S. Open: 15 strokes (2000) (this is the record for all majors).  Also in 2000, Woods became the first player to finish a U.S. Open at double digits under par. (In 1992, Gil Morgan was the first ever to be double digits under par at any stage of a U.S. Open, but failed to finish in double digits under par, and indeed failed to win that event, with Tom Kite winning instead.)  Woods was the only player to finish under par at the following U.S. Opens:  2000 at Pebble Beach Golf Links : -12  2002 at Bethpage State Park, Black Course : -3    With his win in 2008 , Woods equaled Jack Nicklaus' feat of winning each major at least three times.   The Open Championship [ edit ]   Woods shares the record for largest margin of victory at a post-1900 Open Championship: 8 strokes (2000)  Woods became the fifth player to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the youngest player (24 years, 206 days) to do so, breaking the mark held by Nicklaus (26 years, 6 months at the 1966 British Open)  He became the fastest to win all four majors – in his 93rd sanctioned tournament, compared with 125 for Nicklaus  He became the youngest to win a fourth major championship, breaking the mark held by Nicklaus (25 years, 80 days at the 1965 Masters)  In 2006, Woods became the first player to win the Open Championship in back-to-back years since Tom Watson in 1982–83  He became the first golfer since Watson in 1982 to win the U.S. and British Opens in the same year   PGA Championship [ edit ]   With his 2006 PGA Championship win, Woods became the only golfer to have won all 4 majors by at least 5 strokes  Woods is the only player in the stroke-play era (since 1958) to repeat as PGA champion.  Woods' wins at Medinah in 1999 and 2006 make him the only player to win the PGA Championship twice on the same course.  Second round 63 in the 2007 PGA Championship tied the record for second lowest single-round score in major championship history  Woods is the only player to win the PGA Championship back-to-back on two different occasions: 1999–2000 and 2006–2007.

All-time wins leader in World Golf Championships events (41.9% win rate).  All-time money leader in World Golf Championships events.  Won the WGC-World Cup with David Duval in 2000, an unofficial money WGC event, for a total of 19 World Golf Championships titles.  Only player to have held the titles of all three of the pre-2009 events (not counting the HSBC Champions, elevated to WGC status in 2009) at the same time.   Accenture Match Play   Woods set the record for most lopsided victory (18-hole match) in his first round match against Stephen Ames in 2006 – 9 & 8. Mathematically, it is the fastest possible win in 18-hole match play (10 & 8 would be a larger margin of victory, but the same number of holes played).  Woods also set the record for largest margin of victory in the 36-hole final match – 8 & 7 over Stewart Cink in 2008.

Next year, the LPGA western section championship will take place here. The ladies will play from the front tees, which measure a considerable distance from the cup at 500 yards. The longest hole is #9, at 777 yards, par 6.    By Laura Castellano           updated 10/4/2007 11:47:36 AM ET  2007-10-04T15:47:36      Print   Font:   +  -     It has the makings of a publicity stunt, but having one of the longest golf holes in America is also about pride. Course owners and golf pros are pleased to divulge the yardage of their longest hole, from back tee to cup. And, when asked, most add with a hint of uncertainty, “I think we have the longest hole, right?” and then, reassuringly: “It’s really not as hard as it looks.”  Another slightly comforting piece of information when there is no sign of a flag down the fairway: On most of these holes, you can take one more swing than usual to get your ball onto the green. The USGA guidelines are such that any hole 691 yards and longer from the back tees or 591 and longer from the ladies’ tees can be considered a par 6. If you have never heard of a par 6, you are not alone; there are very few of them in the U.S., but most courses with that kind of yardage take advantage of the extra swing (seven of our top ten are par 6), although some golfers don’t need it.  One man playing at the longest hole at Meadows Farms in Locust Grove, Virginia double eagled the 841-yard hole, sinking it in three shots. “He was a long hitter,” general manager Bobby Lewis said. “We were shocked, but we did verify it.”  Bill Meadows, aka “Farmer,” conceived of the longest hole in the late 1990s. At first, the course designer was skeptical, but when he realized it would be a challenge, he went with it. “You have to design it so it’s not something golfers dread,” said Bill Ward Jr., designer of Meadow Farm’s longest hole, as well as a couple of other par 6 holes. “That’s the hardest part—make it look very difficult, but have it be relatively easy.”  Who is it not easy for? Landscapers. The upkeep of a long hole is expensive. Chocolay Golf Club in Marquette, Michigan has had a 1007-yard hole “laid out” for over three years. Golf pro Dennis Kargela said he is not sure if the novelty of it would bring in enough business to cover maintenance costs. The hole would require 50 sprinkler heads and a few 50-pound bags of fertilizer. Aerating it would take twice as long as any of their other holes. “We’re considering reshaping and cutting it down for that reason,” he said.  Veteran record holders at this point, the Meadow Farms landscaping team has managed. “Other than the fairway being long, and so much more to cut, it’s a great hole,” said Meadow Farms’ superintendent Bucky Wheeler, who has been mowing, and playing, the hole for 14 years. “I’ve birdied it before, but I took a ten on it before too. It hurt me to write that ten on the scorecard.”         © www.gallerygolf.com   The longest par 5 in the U.S., (#9 at 725 yards) the Gallery in Marana, Arizona, was designed by John Fought and British Open Champion, Tom Lehman. Two 18-hole courses, North and South, make up this picturesque course that sits among cacti and is surrounded by red canyons.  Though Chocolay Golf Club threatens to take the record, it seems Meadow Farms is safely number one. For now, this is the list of longest holes in the U.S., based on the National Golf Foundation’s available data, which is derived from a list of over 12,000 public and private courses in the United States.

Golf Digest has been tracking data on that subject for more than 60 years, and now, the National Hole In One Association , answers that question with this handy infographic (now would probably be a good time to look away if you haven't had one already). Related: Golf Digest's hole-in-one primer The data below were collected by the HIO over the course of 30 years through their hole-in-one insurance plans. And before you even ask, hole-in-one insurance exists because groups hosting small golf events usually offer expensive prizes to competitors who make an ace as a way of boosting participation. They'll take out a plan just in case they find themselves in the unlikely situation of having to pony-up a car on short notice. But anyway, back to business. An amateur golfer's chance of an ace is 12,500 to 1? Yikes.

By T.J. Auclair PGA.com Connect with T.J.  Series: Golf Buzz   Published: Wednesday, September 13, 2017 | 12:53 p.m.          When it comes to a hole-in-one, an albatross or, even a condor -- more on that coming , if you don't know what it is -- us golfers know they're all extra special.  But just how special are they? Like, what are the odds?  Let's take a look at the three most coveted scores in golf and try to explain...   1. A hole-in-one or ace  According to the National Hole-in-One Registry , the odds of the average golfer making a hole-in-one are 12,000 to 1 .  The National Hole-in-One Registry also has a boatload of other great facts regarding an ace...  - The odds of a Tour player making an ace: 3,000 to 1 - The odds of a low-handicapper making an ace: 5,000 to 1 - The odds of two players from the same foursome acing the same hole: 17 million to 1 - The odds of one player making two holes-in-one in the same round: 67 million to 1  The National Hole-in-One Registry also says that there are roughly 450 million rounds of golf played each year in the U.S., or approximately 25,000-30,000 per course. Each of those courses reports between 10-15 aces per year. That means a hole-in-one is scored once in every 3,500 rounds. Only 1-2 percent of golfers score an ace in a year. The average years of playing golf for a player before making an ace is 24. Can you believe that?   RELATED: Take a closer look at the PGA Tour's 30 aces in the 2016-17 season  Further, the average handicap of a golfer making a hole-in-one is 14. That should prove encouraging for a lot of folks. You clearly don't have to be the best player on the course... you just have to be the luckiest, once.  The age group that makes the most holes in one? That would be golfers between 50-59, which account for 25 percent of aces each year. The next highest percentage age group consists of players between 40-49, who account for 24 percent of annual aces.  Sixteen percent of holes in one are made by women, according to the National Hole-in-One Registry. The average age of a female golfer making an ace is 55, with an average of 15 years playing the game. And the average length of hole for a woman making an ace is 111 yards.   2. An albatross or double eagle  An albatross is achieved when a player either aces a par 4, or scores a "2" on a par 5.   The Double Eagle Club , which touts itself as, "the worldwide registry for double eagles scored," features a story from former longtime Golf World writer Bill Fields, that states the odds of an albatross are an estimated 6 million to 1 .   RELATED: Nine times an albatross was caught on video  But, Fields writes:   Dean Knuth, who was senior director of the handicap department at the USGA from 1981 to 1997 and now a Golf Digest contributing editor, says they're lower than that but still great, about a million-to-one shot.  That makes your chances of becoming one of the couple of hundred golfers a year to make a double eagle (as opposed to 40,000 aces) better than being killed by a shark (1 in 350 million) or dying from a dog bite (one in 18 million) but worse than being struck by lightning (one in 555,000) or, for a woman, having quadruplets without the aid of fertility drugs (one in 729,000).  "They're definitely far more rare than aces," Knuth says. "Someone has to hit two great shots. You have to have length and ability. Only a small percentage of golfers, less then 10 percent, ever reach a par 5 in two. That means 90 percent of golfers don't have a chance of making one."   Imagine that. You have a better chance to be struck by lightning than you do of making an albatross.   3. A condor  First of all, have you ever even heard of a condor? We're not talking about the bird -- a vulture -- but the absolute rarest shot in golf. It's a "1" on a par 5, which believe it or not, has actually been done.   RELATED: 9 golf mysteries, including where the mulligan came from, explained  According to www.golf.co.uk , there have been four condors recorded -- all ones on par 5s, but never a "2" on a rare par 6.  From www.golf.co.uk:   The first occurred in 1962, when Larry Bruce drove into the hole over a stand of trees on the 480-yard dogleg right par-5 fifth hole at Hope Country Club in Arkansas, USA.  Another condor was achieved by "cutting the corner" of a dogleg par-5 by Shaun Lynch at Teign Valley Golf Club in Christow, England, in 1995, on the 496-yard 17th. Lynch aimed straight at the green with a 3-iron, clearing a 20-foot-high hedge and hitting a downslope on the other side, which allowed his ball to roll down to the green and into the hole.  A condor was scored without cutting over a dogleg by Mike Crean at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in Denver, Colorado, in 2002, when he holed his drive at the 517 yard par-5 9th. This is longest hole in one on record, although it was of course aided by the altitude and thin air of 'mile-high' Denver.  The most recent condor was achieved in Australia by 16-year-old Jack Bartlett on the 467 metre par-5 17th at Royal Wentworth Falls Country Club, NSW, Australia, on November 3, 2007.   A condor is so uncommon in golf that bookmakers don't even offer odds on such a feat.  So how did "condor" become a part of golf lingo? It's believed that the only explanation is a continuation of the 'bird' theme for under-par scores with the size of the bird getting bigger as the score gets lower, hence "birdie," "eagle," "albatross," "condor."

The Rules of Golf do not address the issue of the validity of a hole in one. The USGA recommends that a hole in one be considered valid:   If made during a round of at least nine holes, except that a hole in one made during a match should be acceptable even if the match ends before the stipulated round is completed  If the player is playing one ball; a hole in one made in a practice round in which the player is playing two or more balls should not be acceptable  If attested by an acceptable witness  If made at a hole with a temporary tee and/or putting green in use, even if the Committee did not specifically define the teeing ground with tee-markers; the length of the hole at the time should be stated on any certificate  If made in a “scramble” competition, for example, a Captain’s Choice       What is the chance that a golfer will make a hole in one?

For other uses, see Hole in one (disambiguation) .  In golf , a hole in one or hole-in-one (also known as an ace , mostly in American English ) occurs when a ball hit from a tee finishes in the cup. This awards the player a score of one for the hole, but not if the player is making a second shot from the tee due to a lost ball, out of bounds or water hazard.  Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one are considered to also contain an element of luck . [1] [2] As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an albatross ). [3] As of October 2008 [update] , a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5]  Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in disc golf . The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 Big Sky State Games at Diamond X Disc Golf Course, revered as one of the most difficult and unique courses in the world, located in Billings, Montana .     Contents    1  Rarity  2  Competitions  3  Holes-in-one on par 5 (or higher) holes  4  Kim Jong-il myth  5  See also  6  References  7  External links     Rarity [ edit ]  Holes in one are rare, and, although skill definitely increases the probability, there is a great element of luck involved. [6] It is traditional for a player who has scored a hole in one to buy a round of drinks for everyone at the clubhouse bar. [7]  Among the memorable holes in one, one occurred in the 1973 British Open when at age 71, Gene Sarazen made a hole in one. Earl Dietering of Memphis, Tennessee, 78 years old at the time, is believed to hold the record for the oldest person to make a hole-in-one twice during one round. [8]  During the second round of the 1971 Martini International tournament, held at the Royal Norwich Golf Club in England, John Hudson had two consecutive holes in one. Teeing off, using a 4-iron, at the par-three, 195-yard 11th hole, Hudson holed his tee shot for a hole-in-one. At the next hole, the downhill 311-yard, par-four 12th, and this time using a driver, he once again holed his tee shot, for another ace. This is believed to be the only time a player has scored holes-in-one at consecutive holes in a major professional tournament. [9] [10]  Despite the relative rarity of holes in one, there have been a total of six in Ryder Cup matches. Peter Butler scored the first in 1973 at Muirfield followed by a 20-year gap before Nick Faldo scored a hole in one in 1993 . Two years later , Costantino Rocca and Howard Clark both scored holes in one before an 11-year gap to 2006 saw Paul Casey and Scott Verplank both hole out in one on the 14th hole. [11]  On August 11, 2016, Justin Rose shot a hole in one during the first round of the golf tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which is considered to be the first one in the Olympic history.

This is explained as a case of the North Korean government assigning supernatural feats of heroism to its leaders as part of an effort to perpetuate a cult of personality .

For other uses, see Hole in one (disambiguation) .  In golf , a hole in one or hole-in-one (also known as an ace , mostly in American English ) occurs when a ball hit from a tee finishes in the cup. This awards the player a score of one for the hole, but not if the player is making a second shot from the tee due to a lost ball, out of bounds or water hazard.  Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one are considered to also contain an element of luck . [1] [2] As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an albatross ). [3] As of October 2008 [update] , a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5]  Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in disc golf . The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 Big Sky State Games at Diamond X Disc Golf Course, revered as one of the most difficult and unique courses in the world, located in Billings, Montana .

[6] It is traditional for a player who has scored a hole in one to buy a round of drinks for everyone at the clubhouse bar. [7]  Among the memorable holes in one, one occurred in the 1973 British Open when at age 71, Gene Sarazen made a hole in one. Earl Dietering of Memphis, Tennessee, 78 years old at the time, is believed to hold the record for the oldest person to make a hole-in-one twice during one round. [8]  During the second round of the 1971 Martini International tournament, held at the Royal Norwich Golf Club in England, John Hudson had two consecutive holes in one. Teeing off, using a 4-iron, at the par-three, 195-yard 11th hole, Hudson holed his tee shot for a hole-in-one. At the next hole, the downhill 311-yard, par-four 12th, and this time using a driver, he once again holed his tee shot, for another ace. This is believed to be the only time a player has scored holes-in-one at consecutive holes in a major professional tournament. [9] [10]  Despite the relative rarity of holes in one, there have been a total of six in Ryder Cup matches. Peter Butler scored the first in 1973 at Muirfield followed by a 20-year gap before Nick Faldo scored a hole in one in 1993 . Two years later , Costantino Rocca and Howard Clark both scored holes in one before an 11-year gap to 2006 saw Paul Casey and Scott Verplank both hole out in one on the 14th hole. [11]  On August 11, 2016, Justin Rose shot a hole in one during the first round of the golf tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which is considered to be the first one in the Olympic history. For the 189 yards 3-par hole, he used a 7-iron. [12]  Competitions [ edit ]  Occasionally special events host a hole in one contest, where prizes as expensive as a new car, or cash awards sometimes reaching $4 million are offered if a contestant records a hole in one.

For other uses, see Hole in one (disambiguation) .  In golf , a hole in one or hole-in-one (also known as an ace , mostly in American English ) occurs when a ball hit from a tee finishes in the cup. This awards the player a score of one for the hole, but not if the player is making a second shot from the tee due to a lost ball, out of bounds or water hazard.  Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one are considered to also contain an element of luck . [1] [2] As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an albatross ). [3] As of October 2008 [update] , a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5]  Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in disc golf . The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 Big Sky State Games at Diamond X Disc Golf Course, revered as one of the most difficult and unique courses in the world, located in Billings, Montana .

[6] It is traditional for a player who has scored a hole in one to buy a round of drinks for everyone at the clubhouse bar. [7]  Among the memorable holes in one, one occurred in the 1973 British Open when at age 71, Gene Sarazen made a hole in one. Earl Dietering of Memphis, Tennessee, 78 years old at the time, is believed to hold the record for the oldest person to make a hole-in-one twice during one round. [8]  During the second round of the 1971 Martini International tournament, held at the Royal Norwich Golf Club in England, John Hudson had two consecutive holes in one. Teeing off, using a 4-iron, at the par-three, 195-yard 11th hole, Hudson holed his tee shot for a hole-in-one. At the next hole, the downhill 311-yard, par-four 12th, and this time using a driver, he once again holed his tee shot, for another ace. This is believed to be the only time a player has scored holes-in-one at consecutive holes in a major professional tournament. [9] [10]  Despite the relative rarity of holes in one, there have been a total of six in Ryder Cup matches. Peter Butler scored the first in 1973 at Muirfield followed by a 20-year gap before Nick Faldo scored a hole in one in 1993 . Two years later , Costantino Rocca and Howard Clark both scored holes in one before an 11-year gap to 2006 saw Paul Casey and Scott Verplank both hole out in one on the 14th hole. [11]  On August 11, 2016, Justin Rose shot a hole in one during the first round of the golf tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which is considered to be the first one in the Olympic history. For the 189 yards 3-par hole, he used a 7-iron. [12]  Competitions [ edit ]  Occasionally special events host a hole in one contest, where prizes as expensive as a new car, or cash awards sometimes reaching $4 million are offered if a contestant records a hole in one. [13] Usually such expensive prizes are backed by an insurance company who offers prize indemnification services . Actuaries at such companies have calculated the chance of an average golfer making a hole in one at approximately 12,500 to 1, and the odds of a tour professional at 2,500 to 1. [6]  Holes-in-one on par 5 (or higher) holes [ edit ]        This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  (September 2016)     As of October 2008, a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole. [4] [5] A horseshoe-shaped par 5 hole once enabled a condor hole in one to be achieved with a 3-iron club. [4] [5] The longest recorded straight drive hole-in-one is believed to be 517 yards or 473 metres, on the par 5 No. 9 hole at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in Denver in 2002, aided by the thin air due to the high altitude. [4] [5] None of these four par 5 holes-in-one were achieved during a professional tournament. [4] A condor is also known as a double albatross, or a triple eagle. [4] [5]  Kim Jong-il myth [ edit ]  Over a period of several years, many U.S. and European media outlets – including ESPN and the New York Times [14] – reported that former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il was claimed to have shot five holes in one during his first attempt at playing golf (an alternate version of the story claims North Korean media once reported Kim had shot 18 holes in one). This is explained as a case of the North Korean government assigning supernatural feats of heroism to its leaders as part of an effort to perpetuate a cult of personality . This myth was originally published by Eric Ellis, a reporter for the Australian Financial Review , as having been told by a Pyongyang Golf Club professional in 1994. [15]  NK News reports that "informal surveys of North Koreans themselves revealed that no one in Pyongyang was aware of this legendary feat, unless told it by a tourist." [16] Richard Seers, a British journalist who played at the Pyongyang Golf Club asked officials there, who revealed it was nothing more than an urban myth.

Other golfers go their whole golfing careers without one. Just how hard is it to make a hole-in-one ? Exactly what are the odds? Let's take a look at the odds of a "basic" hole-in-one plus some less likely scenarios. (Note on sources: Unless otherwise noted in the text, primary sources are the calculations of Boston University mathematician Francis Scheid, Ph.D., on behalf of Golf Digest ; and National Hole in One, which provides hole-in-one insurance for tournaments.)         Standard Hole-In-One Odds for Amateurs and Pros What are the odds of any given golfer holing out from the tee on a par-3 hole ? Your typical hole-in-one, in other words (as opposed to some of the extraordinary circumstances we'll see below). It partially depends on how good the golfer is. Making an ace includes a heavy dose of luck, but the better you are, the more likely it is you'll eventually get one (because you are hitting more shots onto the green, more balls closer to the hole). Odds of an amateur making a hole-in-one: 12,500 to 1 Odds of a low-handicapper making a hole-in-one: 5,000 to 1 Odds of a professional golfer making an ace: 2,500 to 1 Odds for an average golfer on a 200-yard par-3: 150,000 to 1 Odds of Making a Hole-in-One In Your Lifetime What are the odds of recording at least one ace over the span of a golfer's playing career? If you are a low-handicapper and play 1,000 rounds in your life (an average of 25 rounds for 40 years), you have a 20-percent chance of making at least one hole-in-one.   How many rounds do you have to play to make the odds even - 1:1? If you're a low-handicapper who plays 5,000 rounds (100 rounds a year for 50 years), you're even-money to have at least one ace. (Obviously, the odds are much higher for average golfers.) Hole-in-One Odds for a Group of Golfers Much, much rarer than one golfer making one ace during a round of golf is two golfers from the same group making aces during the same round.         Odds of two golfers in the same group of four making holes-in-one at any point during the round: 1.3 million to 1 Odds of two golfers in the same group of four acing the same hole during the same round: 26 million to 1 The odds are much better, however, for a field of average golfers. According to US Hole In One (which provides hole-in-one insurance), with a field of 100 amateurs on a golf course that has four par-3 holes, there is a 1-in-32 chance someone will make an ace during that event. (Odds of a hole-in-one during the four days of a PGA Tour event, according to the same outfit, are 1:1.) Even More Extraordinary Aces and the Hole-in-One Odds We've told the stories of some amazing aces here, and, of course, you can find many more stories out there on the web at large. Holes-in-one that are so unusual, their odds must be astronomical. To cite a few: In 1971 a European Tour pro aced back-to-back holes (one of which was a par-4) in a tour event . Odds: 50 million to 1. A husband-and-wife duo aced the same hole on back-to-back swings. Odds: Who knows! So rare it hasn't been (perhaps can't be) calculated. A beginning golfer who'd never even birdied made two holes-in-one in five holes. Odds: Get outta here with that crazy talk!  (But it really happened - instructor Rick Smith saw them both.) The odds of one player making two aces in the same round have been calculated at 67 million-to-1.  At the 1989 U.S. Open , four pros aced the same hole (No. 6) during the same round (second).  Odds: 1.6 million to 1 (much lower than you might expect because these guys are so good).

According to Carlos Concha, General Manger with Hole In One International, “the odds of making a hole in one on a par 3 are roughly 1 in 13,000 for amateurs and 1 in 2,500 for professionals.”  Sure, those figures may seem a bit daunting… but if your tournament has an average of 100 amateur players and your golf course or country club has a total of four par 3 holes, the odds of someone in your tournament acing one of those holes is approximately 1 in 32.  Now that’s more like it!  Plus, you can rest easy knowing that whenever hole in one insurance is purchased through Hole In One International, we automatically include up to 4 smaller auxiliary prizes for all players to shoot for (shootouts excluded).  That gives you extra chances at acing a hole during your tournament!  But what about the odds of two people making it on the same hole?  Or better yet, back-to-back hole in ones?  According to Concha, 32,000 to 1 and 156,250,000 to 1, respectively.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.             The 2017 Masters tournament is set to tee off soon, but it isn’t too late to get a piece of the action. While picking an outright winner is a method most bettors are familiar with, one of the more interesting ways to get involved is with the numerous prop bets that sportsbooks are offering.  Many people are familiar with prop bets surrounding the Super Bowl, but golf props can be unfamiliar territory. These Masters props can range from simple things—such as who the top amateur will be at the end of tournament—to more exotic, with bets like will a hole-in-one occur or what the cut line will be after Friday. There’s a plethora of possibilities that allow an adventurous bettor to have more fun watching this upcoming major. It's no joy to lose, which is why expert golf handicapper Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com was asked to send over his top prop selections for this upcoming major.  While it’s always a thrill to see who comes away with the green jacket on Sunday, it could be fun—not to mention lucrative—to play these prop bets in the 2017 Masters. Here's a quick look at the schedule for the tournament, as well as a few of Price's best prop picks for the event:         2017 Masters Schedule  Live Coverage (ET)  TV Network  Live Stream    Thursday, April 6  3 p.m.  ESPN  WatchESPN    Friday, April 7  3 p.m.  ESPN  WatchESPN    Saturday, April 8  3 p.m.  CBS  CBSSports.com    Sunday, April 9  2 p.m.  CBS  CBSSports.com           Top Lefty: Phil Mickelson (-165), Bubba Watson (+120), Mike Weir (+5000)          UNIVERSITY PLACE, WA - JUNE 18: (L-R) Bubba Watson of the United States and Phil Mickelson of the United States shake hands on the 18th hole during the first round of the 115th U.S. Open Championship at Chambers Bay on June 18, 2015 in University Place, Washington. (Photo by Andrew Redington/Getty Images)      The course at Augusta National seems to be made for lefties to dominate. It’s hard to dispute this when six winners since 2003 are southpaws. Mickelson, the game’s most famous lefty—hence his nickname—is responsible for three of those victories. The Arizona State product came away with wins in 2004, 2006 and 2010. Watson added two green jackets to his closest recently, claiming them in 2012 and 2014. Weir started the run on left-handed winners with his surprise victory in 2003.  For the purposes of this prop, throw Weir out. His odds would pay massive dividends on a small wager, but there is little chance the 46-year-old earns a win on Sunday. His only career major was that aforementioned Masters victory 14 years ago, but his performances in recent years have left much to be desired. He’s only made the cut once since 2011, a T-44 finish in 2014.  Mickelson is the odds-on favorite for this prop, but the aging golfer would need to defy father time to contend for a win. Jack Nicklaus became the oldest person to win a green jacket, when he turned back the clock in 1986 to win at 46-years-old. Mickelson, also 46, has a few months on the Golden Bear going into this tournament. Lefty has been playing well leading up to the first major of the season—he has yet to miss a cut—but he’s also coming off two cuts in his past three attempts at the Masters.

What Are The Odds of Making a Hole In One?    Even though the odds of a hole in one from 150 yards away are slim, it does happen. Actually, it happens more often than you would think. There are a number of websites that provide statistics about the chances of an amateur player getting a hole in one. The majority of these website statistics are unreliable.  Some believe that the chances of getting a hole in one are 10,000 to 1. Others claim that the odds are 100,000 to 1. Because our business is based around knowing these statistics, we guarantee that we know the real chances of this occurring. This knowledge also allows us to determine the probability of these events occurring at your tournament.  What are the actual odds of making a hole in one on a par 3 hole for an amateur?  The odds are 12,500 to 1. For professional golfers, the odds drop to 2,500 to 1. Knowing this information allows us to figure out the chances of someone making a hole in one during your tournament. If your event has 100 amateur participants and the golf course has four par 3 holes, the odds of a player making a hole in one are 1 in 32. The chance of a participant hitting an ace no longer seems impossible, does it?  If you are hosting a professional tournament , the probability of a golfer making an ace increases. The average PGA tournament has 144 professional golfers. The odds of a golfer making a hole in one during a day of golfing are 1 in 4.5. The means that the chances of a golfer making a hole in one during a four-day PGA Tour tournament are 1 in 1. It can certainly pay to be a skilled golfer.  You have probably heard stories of two players making an ace at the same event on the same hole. Realistically, the odds of this happening are slim. Statistically, there is a 32,000 to 1 chance of this occurring. Maybe you have also heard the tale of the professional golfer that hits three consecutive holes in one during the same tournament. The chances of a golfer getting three consecutive aces on a par 3 course are 156,250,000 to 1. A golfer has a better chance of winning the Powerball lottery than accomplishing three consecutive holes-in-one.  Either way the odds and the event are what creates true excitement, and a hole-in-one is a memory that will last forever.            24/7 Service  Throughout the golf season  (888)-527-6944  CustomerCare@HIO.com    Or Get A Quote Online, Click Here    Need Golf Signs?
