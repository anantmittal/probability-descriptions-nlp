This doesn't mean I'm great at it :)  To help improve this, I usually download math related apps on my mobile phone to keep me entertained on the train. One of these apps contains "probability puzzles". One of the easy puzzles states the following:   Suppose babies are boys with probability 0.51, girls with probability
  0.49, and births are independent.  If you have two children, what's the probability they're both girls?   This seemed straight forward to me.   0 girls = 0.255   1 girl = 0.49   2 girls = 0.245   But the puzzle indicates this as wrong. Am I missing something? The only thing I can't quite set into context is the following sentence from the question:   and births are independent   What does this actually mean? (not a native English speaker).  Thank you    probability  puzzle     share | cite | improve this question     asked Nov 15 '16 at 8:22       Goowik   103 4              1      Births being independent refers to Independence (probability theory) .  The short explanation is that $A$ and $B$ are independent events iff $P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$ iff $P(A\mid B)=P(A)$, i.e. the probability of $A$ occurring does not at all depend on whether or not $B$ has occurred, i.e. whether we have knowledge that $B$ as having occurred or not we cannot know anything more about the probability of whether or not $A$ has occurred. – JMoravitz  Nov 15 '16 at 8:28        1      $0$ girls would be $0.51^2$, $1$ girl would be $0.51\cdot 0.49\cdot 2$ and $2$ girls would be $0.49^2$.  See binomial distribution . – JMoravitz  Nov 15 '16 at 8:29            Oh waw, was I really that far off?! Now I feel stupid :) – Goowik  Nov 15 '16 at 8:42        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote  accepted      " births are independent" intuitively mean that the gender of the previous child does not affect the gender of the next child.  In mathematical language, if $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then $P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B)$.  So in this case the probability of having two girls should be (0.49)(0.49)=0.2401.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 15 '16 at 8:29       yoyostein   7,024 6 31 64              2      okay thanks for clearing up (to all of you). Not sure why I was thinking of dividing it. But now the independence seems clear. It's like drawing an ace from 2 different decks of cards (instead of one). – Goowik  Nov 15 '16 at 8:44        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      You have $4$ disjoint events:   BB, for which the probability is $0.51\cdot0.51=0.2601$  BG, for which the probability is $0.51\cdot0.49=0.2499$  GB, for which the probability is $0.49\cdot0.51=0.2499$  GG, for which the probability is $0.49\cdot0.49=0.2401$      share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 15 '16 at 8:50       barak manos   37.2k 7 40 92                  I see thanks.

Incapsula incident ID: 303001860163886906-325554329168579494         Q-function   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      A plot of the Q-function.    In statistics , the Q-function is the tail distribution function of the standard normal distribution . [1] [2] In other words,     Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle Q(x)}   is the probability that a normal (Gaussian) random variable will obtain a value larger than     x    {\displaystyle x}   standard deviations above the mean. Equivalently,     Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle Q(x)}   is the probability that a standard normal random variable takes a value larger than     x    {\displaystyle x}   .  If     Y    {\displaystyle Y}   is a Gaussian random variable with mean     μ    {\displaystyle \mu }   and variance      σ   2      {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}   , then     X  =     Y  −  μ   σ      {\displaystyle X={\frac {Y-\mu }{\sigma }}}   is standard normal and       P  (  Y  >  y  )  =  P  (  X  >  x  )  =  Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle P(Y>y)=P(X>x)=Q(x)}     where     x  =     y  −  μ   σ      {\displaystyle x={\frac {y-\mu }{\sigma }}}   .  Other definitions of the Q -function, all of which are simple transformations of the normal cumulative distribution function , are also used occasionally. [3]  Because of its relation to the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution, the Q -function can also be expressed in terms of the error function , which is an important function in applied mathematics and physics.     Contents    1  Definition and basic properties  2  Values  3  Generalization to high dimensions  4  References     Definition and basic properties [ edit ]  Formally, the Q -function is defined as       Q  (  x  )  =    1   2  π      ∫   x    ∞    exp  ⁡   (   −     u   2    2     )    d  u  .    {\displaystyle Q(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\int _{x}^{\infty }\exp \left(-{\frac {u^{2}}{2}}\right)\,du.}     Thus,       Q  (  x  )  =  1  −  Q  (  −  x  )  =  1  −  Φ  (  x  )    ,    {\displaystyle Q(x)=1-Q(-x)=1-\Phi (x)\,\!,}     where     Φ  (  x  )    {\displaystyle \Phi (x)}   is the cumulative distribution function of the normal Gaussian distribution .  The Q -function can be expressed in terms of the error function , or the complementary error function, as [2]           Q  (  x  )     =    1  2     (     2   π      ∫   x   /     2      ∞    exp  ⁡   (   −   t   2     )    d  t   )         =    1  2    −    1  2    erf  ⁡   (    x   2     )        -or-         =    1  2    erfc  ⁡   (    x   2     )   .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Q(x)&={\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {2}{\sqrt {\pi }}}\int _{x/{\sqrt {2}}}^{\infty }\exp \left(-t^{2}\right)\,dt\right)\\&={\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {1}{2}}\operatorname {erf} \left({\frac {x}{\sqrt {2}}}\right)~~{\text{ -or-}}\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\operatorname {erfc} \left({\frac {x}{\sqrt {2}}}\right).\end{aligned}}}     An alternative form of the Q -function known as Craig's formula, after its discoverer, is expressed as: [4]       Q  (  x  )  =    1  π     ∫   0     π  2     exp  ⁡   (   −     x   2     2   sin   2    ⁡  θ      )   d  θ  .    {\displaystyle Q(x)={\frac {1}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\frac {\pi }{2}}\exp \left(-{\frac {x^{2}}{2\sin ^{2}\theta }}\right)d\theta .}     This expression is valid only for positive values of x , but it can be used in conjunction with Q ( x ) = 1 − Q (− x ) to obtain Q ( x ) for negative values. This form is advantageous in that the range of integration is fixed and finite.   The Q -function is not an elementary function . However, the bounds, where     ϕ  (  x  )    {\displaystyle \phi (x)}   is the density function of the standard normal distribution,           (    x   1  +   x   2       )   ϕ  (  x  )  <  Q  (  x  )  <     ϕ  (  x  )   x    ,   x  >  0  ,    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {x}{1+x^{2}}}\right)\phi (x)<Q(x)<{\frac {\phi (x)}{x}},\qquad x>0,}        become increasingly tight for large x , and are often useful.    Using the substitution  v = u 2 /2, the upper bound is derived as follows:          Q  (  x  )  =   ∫   x    ∞    ϕ  (  u  )   d  u  <   ∫   x    ∞      u  x    ϕ  (  u  )   d  u  =   ∫     x   2    2     ∞       e   −  v     x    2  π        d  v  =  −          e   −  v     x    2  π          |       x   2    2     ∞    =     ϕ  (  x  )   x    .    {\displaystyle Q(x)=\int _{x}^{\infty }\phi (u)\,du<\int _{x}^{\infty }{\frac {u}{x}}\phi (u)\,du=\int _{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}^{\infty }{\frac {e^{-v}}{x{\sqrt {2\pi }}}}\,dv=-{\biggl .}{\frac {e^{-v}}{x{\sqrt {2\pi }}}}{\biggr |}_{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}^{\infty }={\frac {\phi (x)}{x}}.}        Similarly, using      ϕ  ′   (  u  )  =  −  u  ϕ  (  u  )    {\displaystyle \phi '(u)=-u\phi (u)}   and the quotient rule ,           (   1  +    1   x   2       )   Q  (  x  )  =   ∫   x    ∞     (   1  +    1   x   2       )   ϕ  (  u  )   d  u  >   ∫   x    ∞     (   1  +    1   u   2       )   ϕ  (  u  )   d  u  =  −          ϕ  (  u  )   u       |     x    ∞    =     ϕ  (  x  )   x    .    {\displaystyle \left(1+{\frac {1}{x^{2}}}\right)Q(x)=\int _{x}^{\infty }\left(1+{\frac {1}{x^{2}}}\right)\phi (u)\,du>\int _{x}^{\infty }\left(1+{\frac {1}{u^{2}}}\right)\phi (u)\,du=-{\biggl .}{\frac {\phi (u)}{u}}{\biggr |}_{x}^{\infty }={\frac {\phi (x)}{x}}.}        Solving for Q ( x ) provides the lower bound.    The Chernoff bound of the Q -function is          Q  (  x  )  ≤   e   −     x   2    2      ,   x  >  0    {\displaystyle Q(x)\leq e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}},\qquad x>0}        Improved exponential bounds and a pure exponential approximation are [5]          Q  (  x  )  ≤     1  4      e   −   x   2      +     1  4      e   −     x   2    2      ≤     1  2      e   −     x   2    2      ,   x  >  0    {\displaystyle Q(x)\leq {\tfrac {1}{4}}e^{-x^{2}}+{\tfrac {1}{4}}e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}}\leq {\tfrac {1}{2}}e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}},\qquad x>0}              Q  (  x  )  ≈    1  12     e   −     x   2    2      +    1  4     e   −    2  3     x   2      ,   x  >  0    {\displaystyle Q(x)\approx {\frac {1}{12}}e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}}+{\frac {1}{4}}e^{-{\frac {2}{3}}x^{2}},\qquad x>0}        A tight approximation of     Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle Q(x)}   for     x  ∈  [  0  ,  ∞  )    {\displaystyle x\in [0,\infty )}   is given by Karagiannidis & Lioumpas (2007) [6] who showed for the appropriate choice of parameters     {  A  ,  B  }    {\displaystyle \{A,B\}}   that        f  (  x  ;  A  ,  B  )  =      (   1  −   e   −  A  x     )    e   −   x   2        B    π    x     ≈  erfc  ⁡   (  x  )   .    {\displaystyle f(x;A,B)={\frac {\left(1-e^{-Ax}\right)e^{-x^{2}}}{B{\sqrt {\pi }}x}}\approx \operatorname {erfc} \left(x\right).}    The absolute error between     f  (  x  ;  A  ,  B  )    {\displaystyle f(x;A,B)}   and     erfc  ⁡  (  x  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {erfc} (x)}   over the range     [  0  ,  R  ]    {\displaystyle [0,R]}   is minimized by evaluating      {  A  ,  B  }  =     a  r  g    m  i  n    {  A  ,  B  }       1  R     ∫   0    R     |   f  (  x  ;  A  ,  B  )  −  erfc  ⁡  (  x  )   |   d  x  .    {\displaystyle \{A,B\}={\underset {\{A,B\}}{arg\ min}}{\frac {1}{R}}\int _{0}^{R}|f(x;A,B)-\operatorname {erfc} (x)|dx.}    Using     R  =  20    {\displaystyle R=20}   and numerically integrating, they found the minimum error occurred when     {  A  ,  B  }  =  {  1.98  ,  1.135  }  ,    {\displaystyle \{A,B\}=\{1.98,1.135\},}   which gave a good approximation for     ∀  x  ≥  0.    {\displaystyle \forall x\geq 0.}    Substituting these values and using the relationship between     Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle Q(x)}   and     erfc  ⁡  (  x  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {erfc} (x)}   from above gives      Q  (  x  )  ≈      (   1  −   e   −  1.4  x     )    e   −     x   2    2        1.135    2  π    x     ,  x  ≥  0.    {\displaystyle Q(x)\approx {\frac {\left(1-e^{-1.4x}\right)e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}}}{1.135{\sqrt {2\pi }}x}},x\geq 0.}     Inverse Q  The inverse Q -function can be related to the inverse error functions :        Q   −  1    (  y  )  =    2        e  r  f    −  1    (  1  −  2  y  )  =    2        e  r  f  c    −  1    (  2  y  )    {\displaystyle Q^{-1}(y)={\sqrt {2}}\ \mathrm {erf} ^{-1}(1-2y)={\sqrt {2}}\ \mathrm {erfc} ^{-1}(2y)}     The function      Q   −  1    (  y  )    {\displaystyle Q^{-1}(y)}   finds application in digital communications. It is usually expressed in dB and generally called Q-factor :        Q   -   f  a  c  t  o  r   =  20   log   10      (    Q   −  1    (  y  )   )       d  B     {\displaystyle \mathrm {Q{\text{-}}factor} =20\log _{10}\!\left(Q^{-1}(y)\right)\!~\mathrm {dB} }     where y is the bit-error rate (BER) of the digitally modulated signal under analysis. For instance, for QPSK in additive white Gaussian noise, the Q-factor defined above coincides with the value in dB of the signal to noise ratio that yields a bit error rate equal to y .     Q-factor vs. bit error rate (BER).

As in the one dimensional case, there is no simple analytical formula for the Q -function. Nevertheless, the Q -function can be approximated arbitrarily well as     γ    {\displaystyle \gamma }   becomes larger and larger.

This doesn't mean I'm great at it :)  To help improve this, I usually download math related apps on my mobile phone to keep me entertained on the train. One of these apps contains "probability puzzles". One of the easy puzzles states the following:   Suppose babies are boys with probability 0.51, girls with probability
  0.49, and births are independent.  If you have two children, what's the probability they're both girls?   This seemed straight forward to me.   0 girls = 0.255   1 girl = 0.49   2 girls = 0.245   But the puzzle indicates this as wrong. Am I missing something? The only thing I can't quite set into context is the following sentence from the question:   and births are independent   What does this actually mean? (not a native English speaker).  Thank you    probability  puzzle     share | cite | improve this question     asked Nov 15 '16 at 8:22       Goowik   103 4              1      Births being independent refers to Independence (probability theory) .  The short explanation is that $A$ and $B$ are independent events iff $P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$ iff $P(A\mid B)=P(A)$, i.e. the probability of $A$ occurring does not at all depend on whether or not $B$ has occurred, i.e. whether we have knowledge that $B$ as having occurred or not we cannot know anything more about the probability of whether or not $A$ has occurred. – JMoravitz  Nov 15 '16 at 8:28        1      $0$ girls would be $0.51^2$, $1$ girl would be $0.51\cdot 0.49\cdot 2$ and $2$ girls would be $0.49^2$.  See binomial distribution . – JMoravitz  Nov 15 '16 at 8:29            Oh waw, was I really that far off?!

In mathematical language, if $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then $P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B)$.  So in this case the probability of having two girls should be (0.49)(0.49)=0.2401.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 15 '16 at 8:29       yoyostein   7,024 6 31 64              2      okay thanks for clearing up (to all of you). Not sure why I was thinking of dividing it. But now the independence seems clear. It's like drawing an ace from 2 different decks of cards (instead of one). – Goowik  Nov 15 '16 at 8:44        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      You have $4$ disjoint events:   BB, for which the probability is $0.51\cdot0.51=0.2601$  BG, for which the probability is $0.51\cdot0.49=0.2499$  GB, for which the probability is $0.49\cdot0.51=0.2499$  GG, for which the probability is $0.49\cdot0.49=0.2401$      share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 15 '16 at 8:50       barak manos   37.2k 7 40 92                  I see thanks.

Incapsula incident ID: 514000370313324931-507744131754361432         Q-function   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      A plot of the Q-function.    In statistics , the Q-function is the tail distribution function of the standard normal distribution . [1] [2] In other words,     Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle Q(x)}   is the probability that a normal (Gaussian) random variable will obtain a value larger than     x    {\displaystyle x}   standard deviations above the mean. Equivalently,     Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle Q(x)}   is the probability that a standard normal random variable takes a value larger than     x    {\displaystyle x}   .  If     Y    {\displaystyle Y}   is a Gaussian random variable with mean     μ    {\displaystyle \mu }   and variance      σ   2      {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}   , then     X  =     Y  −  μ   σ      {\displaystyle X={\frac {Y-\mu }{\sigma }}}   is standard normal and       P  (  Y  >  y  )  =  P  (  X  >  x  )  =  Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle P(Y>y)=P(X>x)=Q(x)}     where     x  =     y  −  μ   σ      {\displaystyle x={\frac {y-\mu }{\sigma }}}   .  Other definitions of the Q -function, all of which are simple transformations of the normal cumulative distribution function , are also used occasionally. [3]  Because of its relation to the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution, the Q -function can also be expressed in terms of the error function , which is an important function in applied mathematics and physics.     Contents    1  Definition and basic properties  2  Values  3  Generalization to high dimensions  4  References     Definition and basic properties [ edit ]  Formally, the Q -function is defined as       Q  (  x  )  =    1   2  π      ∫   x    ∞    exp  ⁡   (   −     u   2    2     )    d  u  .    {\displaystyle Q(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\int _{x}^{\infty }\exp \left(-{\frac {u^{2}}{2}}\right)\,du.}     Thus,       Q  (  x  )  =  1  −  Q  (  −  x  )  =  1  −  Φ  (  x  )    ,    {\displaystyle Q(x)=1-Q(-x)=1-\Phi (x)\,\!,}     where     Φ  (  x  )    {\displaystyle \Phi (x)}   is the cumulative distribution function of the normal Gaussian distribution .  The Q -function can be expressed in terms of the error function , or the complementary error function, as [2]           Q  (  x  )     =    1  2     (     2   π      ∫   x   /     2      ∞    exp  ⁡   (   −   t   2     )    d  t   )         =    1  2    −    1  2    erf  ⁡   (    x   2     )        -or-         =    1  2    erfc  ⁡   (    x   2     )   .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Q(x)&={\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {2}{\sqrt {\pi }}}\int _{x/{\sqrt {2}}}^{\infty }\exp \left(-t^{2}\right)\,dt\right)\\&={\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {1}{2}}\operatorname {erf} \left({\frac {x}{\sqrt {2}}}\right)~~{\text{ -or-}}\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\operatorname {erfc} \left({\frac {x}{\sqrt {2}}}\right).\end{aligned}}}     An alternative form of the Q -function known as Craig's formula, after its discoverer, is expressed as: [4]       Q  (  x  )  =    1  π     ∫   0     π  2     exp  ⁡   (   −     x   2     2   sin   2    ⁡  θ      )   d  θ  .    {\displaystyle Q(x)={\frac {1}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\frac {\pi }{2}}\exp \left(-{\frac {x^{2}}{2\sin ^{2}\theta }}\right)d\theta .}     This expression is valid only for positive values of x , but it can be used in conjunction with Q ( x ) = 1 − Q (− x ) to obtain Q ( x ) for negative values. This form is advantageous in that the range of integration is fixed and finite.   The Q -function is not an elementary function . However, the bounds, where     ϕ  (  x  )    {\displaystyle \phi (x)}   is the density function of the standard normal distribution,           (    x   1  +   x   2       )   ϕ  (  x  )  <  Q  (  x  )  <     ϕ  (  x  )   x    ,   x  >  0  ,    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {x}{1+x^{2}}}\right)\phi (x)<Q(x)<{\frac {\phi (x)}{x}},\qquad x>0,}        become increasingly tight for large x , and are often useful.    Using the substitution  v = u 2 /2, the upper bound is derived as follows:          Q  (  x  )  =   ∫   x    ∞    ϕ  (  u  )   d  u  <   ∫   x    ∞      u  x    ϕ  (  u  )   d  u  =   ∫     x   2    2     ∞       e   −  v     x    2  π        d  v  =  −          e   −  v     x    2  π          |       x   2    2     ∞    =     ϕ  (  x  )   x    .    {\displaystyle Q(x)=\int _{x}^{\infty }\phi (u)\,du<\int _{x}^{\infty }{\frac {u}{x}}\phi (u)\,du=\int _{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}^{\infty }{\frac {e^{-v}}{x{\sqrt {2\pi }}}}\,dv=-{\biggl .}{\frac {e^{-v}}{x{\sqrt {2\pi }}}}{\biggr |}_{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}^{\infty }={\frac {\phi (x)}{x}}.}        Similarly, using      ϕ  ′   (  u  )  =  −  u  ϕ  (  u  )    {\displaystyle \phi '(u)=-u\phi (u)}   and the quotient rule ,           (   1  +    1   x   2       )   Q  (  x  )  =   ∫   x    ∞     (   1  +    1   x   2       )   ϕ  (  u  )   d  u  >   ∫   x    ∞     (   1  +    1   u   2       )   ϕ  (  u  )   d  u  =  −          ϕ  (  u  )   u       |     x    ∞    =     ϕ  (  x  )   x    .    {\displaystyle \left(1+{\frac {1}{x^{2}}}\right)Q(x)=\int _{x}^{\infty }\left(1+{\frac {1}{x^{2}}}\right)\phi (u)\,du>\int _{x}^{\infty }\left(1+{\frac {1}{u^{2}}}\right)\phi (u)\,du=-{\biggl .}{\frac {\phi (u)}{u}}{\biggr |}_{x}^{\infty }={\frac {\phi (x)}{x}}.}        Solving for Q ( x ) provides the lower bound.    The Chernoff bound of the Q -function is          Q  (  x  )  ≤   e   −     x   2    2      ,   x  >  0    {\displaystyle Q(x)\leq e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}},\qquad x>0}        Improved exponential bounds and a pure exponential approximation are [5]          Q  (  x  )  ≤     1  4      e   −   x   2      +     1  4      e   −     x   2    2      ≤     1  2      e   −     x   2    2      ,   x  >  0    {\displaystyle Q(x)\leq {\tfrac {1}{4}}e^{-x^{2}}+{\tfrac {1}{4}}e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}}\leq {\tfrac {1}{2}}e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}},\qquad x>0}              Q  (  x  )  ≈    1  12     e   −     x   2    2      +    1  4     e   −    2  3     x   2      ,   x  >  0    {\displaystyle Q(x)\approx {\frac {1}{12}}e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}}+{\frac {1}{4}}e^{-{\frac {2}{3}}x^{2}},\qquad x>0}        A tight approximation of     Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle Q(x)}   for     x  ∈  [  0  ,  ∞  )    {\displaystyle x\in [0,\infty )}   is given by Karagiannidis & Lioumpas (2007) [6] who showed for the appropriate choice of parameters     {  A  ,  B  }    {\displaystyle \{A,B\}}   that        f  (  x  ;  A  ,  B  )  =      (   1  −   e   −  A  x     )    e   −   x   2        B    π    x     ≈  erfc  ⁡   (  x  )   .    {\displaystyle f(x;A,B)={\frac {\left(1-e^{-Ax}\right)e^{-x^{2}}}{B{\sqrt {\pi }}x}}\approx \operatorname {erfc} \left(x\right).}    The absolute error between     f  (  x  ;  A  ,  B  )    {\displaystyle f(x;A,B)}   and     erfc  ⁡  (  x  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {erfc} (x)}   over the range     [  0  ,  R  ]    {\displaystyle [0,R]}   is minimized by evaluating      {  A  ,  B  }  =     a  r  g    m  i  n    {  A  ,  B  }       1  R     ∫   0    R     |   f  (  x  ;  A  ,  B  )  −  erfc  ⁡  (  x  )   |   d  x  .    {\displaystyle \{A,B\}={\underset {\{A,B\}}{arg\ min}}{\frac {1}{R}}\int _{0}^{R}|f(x;A,B)-\operatorname {erfc} (x)|dx.}    Using     R  =  20    {\displaystyle R=20}   and numerically integrating, they found the minimum error occurred when     {  A  ,  B  }  =  {  1.98  ,  1.135  }  ,    {\displaystyle \{A,B\}=\{1.98,1.135\},}   which gave a good approximation for     ∀  x  ≥  0.    {\displaystyle \forall x\geq 0.}    Substituting these values and using the relationship between     Q  (  x  )    {\displaystyle Q(x)}   and     erfc  ⁡  (  x  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {erfc} (x)}   from above gives      Q  (  x  )  ≈      (   1  −   e   −  1.4  x     )    e   −     x   2    2        1.135    2  π    x     ,  x  ≥  0.    {\displaystyle Q(x)\approx {\frac {\left(1-e^{-1.4x}\right)e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}}}{1.135{\sqrt {2\pi }}x}},x\geq 0.}     Inverse Q  The inverse Q -function can be related to the inverse error functions :        Q   −  1    (  y  )  =    2        e  r  f    −  1    (  1  −  2  y  )  =    2        e  r  f  c    −  1    (  2  y  )    {\displaystyle Q^{-1}(y)={\sqrt {2}}\ \mathrm {erf} ^{-1}(1-2y)={\sqrt {2}}\ \mathrm {erfc} ^{-1}(2y)}     The function      Q   −  1    (  y  )    {\displaystyle Q^{-1}(y)}   finds application in digital communications. It is usually expressed in dB and generally called Q-factor :        Q   -   f  a  c  t  o  r   =  20   log   10      (    Q   −  1    (  y  )   )       d  B     {\displaystyle \mathrm {Q{\text{-}}factor} =20\log _{10}\!\left(Q^{-1}(y)\right)\!~\mathrm {dB} }     where y is the bit-error rate (BER) of the digitally modulated signal under analysis. For instance, for QPSK in additive white Gaussian noise, the Q-factor defined above coincides with the value in dB of the signal to noise ratio that yields a bit error rate equal to y .

As in the one dimensional case, there is no simple analytical formula for the Q -function. Nevertheless, the Q -function can be approximated arbitrarily well as     γ    {\displaystyle \gamma }   becomes larger and larger.
