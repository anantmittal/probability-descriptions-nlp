The numbers they chose were 5, 12, 34, 33, 42, with supplementary numbers 30 and 32. That&apos;s right —   32, 33, 34 , all in the one draw. How did that pattern fit with your usual plan of choosing family birthdays and your house number? Perhaps the lucky numbers from Saturday, December 19, 2009, might have suited you better — they included 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 23 and supplementaries 26 and 41. It&apos;s hard to imagine marking that many close together, and yet there were 27 winners to share the $4 million division-one prize that Saturday night. Get the latest Australian Lotto results The truth is, everyone has a different method for choosing lucky lotto numbers. There is only one certainty: that your chances of winning are about one in 2 million with a basic four-game pick. Mind you, they&apos;re not bad odds when you consider that with Oz Lotto you&apos;re looking at a one in 11 million chance and with Powerball it&apos;s one in 14 million. "That&apos;s what you call lucky," says Professor John Croucher of the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, an expert in statistics and author of Number Crunch  (Pan Australia, 2006) and The Secret Language  (ABC Books). "It&apos;s what we call a &apos;statistical variation&apos; — a boring term for what everyone else calls &apos;luck&apos;. There&apos;s a random element in all gambling and it&apos;s not possible to predict who will win." The Gary Ablett factor So what is the best way to choose numbers? Some people like to choose numbers that come up all the time. Others go with those that are not so frequent. Visit the NSW Lotteries website and you&apos;ll find a "Number Selector" tool that allows you to track both with the push of one button. In case you were wondering, John Vineburg from NSW Lotteries offers the following information about Oz Lotto&apos;s luckiest and unluckiest numbers: Lucky: 3, 35, 13, 17, 33, 26 and 25. Unlucky: 36, 42, 38, 30, 24, 14 and 10. Be aware, though, that statistically it makes no difference as to whether your lucky seven comes out every week or once in a blue moon. "I know that people have theories that some numbers are luckier than others because they come up more frequently, while others say that infrequent numbers are overdue," Croucher says. "Realistically, it doesn&apos;t matter. Lotto numbers have no memory. There&apos;s no emotion involved and no memory." In Geelong, they might disagree. According to the Geelong Advertiser , AFL footballer Gary Ablett Jr is proving lucky for many local residents. Ablett, who picked up a premiership and the Brownlow Medal with the Geelong Cats in 2009, plays in guernsey 29 — a number which appeared for three Geelong division one Tattslotto winners in 2009. The secret to winning Of course, it may not be which numbers you choose, but where you choose them that makes the difference. Greystanes in NSW topped the list of Australia&apos;s top 20 lotto-winning suburbs for 2009, now being home to $9.4 million in new Lotto winnings. But that amount was shared between only two winners. If you&apos;re looking for the spot that struck it lucky the most often, you&apos;d need to travel to Perth in WA or Campbelltown in NSW, with four winners each. So you have to ask, are they winning more often because they&apos;re buying more tickets in these places? "That&apos;s not necessarily true," Croucher says. "You could buy one and I could buy 50 and you could still win. Of course, it does increase your chances if you buy more tickets, but it doesn&apos;t guarantee a win. Basically, the luckiest suburbs are random, and it all comes back to that statistical variation." Which means that hightailing it to Greystanes to buy your next ticket won&apos;t necessarily improve your chances of a big win. Whether you use a dartboard, astrology, numerology, special dates, or whim to choose your numbers, play the same numbers religiously for years or change them each week depending on the weather conditions, there&apos;s only one way to improve your chances of winning: buy a ticket. "If you don&apos;t buy a ticket, the chances of winning are easy to calculate," Croucher says, who admits to going the autopick option to choose his numbers. "That is, there&apos;s no chance of winning at all."

(November 2010)     Lotteries in Australia include various lottery related products licensed by the Lott and Lotterywest Australian lottery companies. Lotteries operators are licensed at a state or territory level, and include both state government -owned, not-for-profit and private sector  companies .

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

Syndicates help you to buy larger entries that have greater chance of winning.  How do I claim my Oz Lotto prize?

The numbers they chose were 5, 12, 34, 33, 42, with supplementary numbers 30 and 32. That&apos;s right —   32, 33, 34 , all in the one draw. How did that pattern fit with your usual plan of choosing family birthdays and your house number? Perhaps the lucky numbers from Saturday, December 19, 2009, might have suited you better — they included 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 23 and supplementaries 26 and 41. It&apos;s hard to imagine marking that many close together, and yet there were 27 winners to share the $4 million division-one prize that Saturday night. Get the latest Australian Lotto results The truth is, everyone has a different method for choosing lucky lotto numbers. There is only one certainty: that your chances of winning are about one in 2 million with a basic four-game pick. Mind you, they&apos;re not bad odds when you consider that with Oz Lotto you&apos;re looking at a one in 11 million chance and with Powerball it&apos;s one in 14 million. "That&apos;s what you call lucky," says Professor John Croucher of the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, an expert in statistics and author of Number Crunch  (Pan Australia, 2006) and The Secret Language  (ABC Books). "It&apos;s what we call a &apos;statistical variation&apos; — a boring term for what everyone else calls &apos;luck&apos;. There&apos;s a random element in all gambling and it&apos;s not possible to predict who will win." The Gary Ablett factor So what is the best way to choose numbers? Some people like to choose numbers that come up all the time. Others go with those that are not so frequent. Visit the NSW Lotteries website and you&apos;ll find a "Number Selector" tool that allows you to track both with the push of one button. In case you were wondering, John Vineburg from NSW Lotteries offers the following information about Oz Lotto&apos;s luckiest and unluckiest numbers: Lucky: 3, 35, 13, 17, 33, 26 and 25. Unlucky: 36, 42, 38, 30, 24, 14 and 10. Be aware, though, that statistically it makes no difference as to whether your lucky seven comes out every week or once in a blue moon. "I know that people have theories that some numbers are luckier than others because they come up more frequently, while others say that infrequent numbers are overdue," Croucher says. "Realistically, it doesn&apos;t matter. Lotto numbers have no memory. There&apos;s no emotion involved and no memory." In Geelong, they might disagree. According to the Geelong Advertiser , AFL footballer Gary Ablett Jr is proving lucky for many local residents. Ablett, who picked up a premiership and the Brownlow Medal with the Geelong Cats in 2009, plays in guernsey 29 — a number which appeared for three Geelong division one Tattslotto winners in 2009. The secret to winning Of course, it may not be which numbers you choose, but where you choose them that makes the difference. Greystanes in NSW topped the list of Australia&apos;s top 20 lotto-winning suburbs for 2009, now being home to $9.4 million in new Lotto winnings. But that amount was shared between only two winners. If you&apos;re looking for the spot that struck it lucky the most often, you&apos;d need to travel to Perth in WA or Campbelltown in NSW, with four winners each. So you have to ask, are they winning more often because they&apos;re buying more tickets in these places? "That&apos;s not necessarily true," Croucher says. "You could buy one and I could buy 50 and you could still win. Of course, it does increase your chances if you buy more tickets, but it doesn&apos;t guarantee a win. Basically, the luckiest suburbs are random, and it all comes back to that statistical variation." Which means that hightailing it to Greystanes to buy your next ticket won&apos;t necessarily improve your chances of a big win. Whether you use a dartboard, astrology, numerology, special dates, or whim to choose your numbers, play the same numbers religiously for years or change them each week depending on the weather conditions, there&apos;s only one way to improve your chances of winning: buy a ticket. "If you don&apos;t buy a ticket, the chances of winning are easy to calculate," Croucher says, who admits to going the autopick option to choose his numbers. "That is, there&apos;s no chance of winning at all."

And he said the secret to his success was syndicates.  “Not only do I increase my chances of winning but the cost is shared among 12 of us, so it’s a relatively cheap way to play.”  The man from Maddington, South Perth, has won around $500,000 in prize money over the past five years, with five of his six winning tickets bought incredibly from the same local newsagent.  Find out how to increase your chances of winning lotto by playing Syndicates here .  How to play a syndicate with Oz Lotteries    Increase your odds with a Syndicate  Syndicates let you share the cost of a lotto ticket with other players so that you can play a lot more games for less money. Playing more games increases your chance of winning. And if the syndicate wins, the prizes are shared equally among the syndicate players. Learn more about syndicate shares.  More chances to win for less  On average, most of our syndicates offer over 500 chances to win a jackpot for less than $50. This works out to be 20 times cheaper, on average, than it would to buy the same amount of tickets on your own. Our syndicates are made up of small groups of 10-20 people. This size of group provides a good balance between increasing your chances of winning and lower prize shares.  We look after everything  Oz Lotteries manages each syndicate so that you don’t have to worry. Each player pays for their share and once all shares of a syndicate are filled, Oz Lotteries purchases the tickets. You’ll then receive an email to let you know what numbers your syndicate is playing for the coming draws.  After each draw, we send you a results email that lets you know if your syndicate has won a prize. If you have won, Oz Lotteries divides the prize equally between all shares and deposits the funds into your account. You can then either withdraw your winnings or use these funds to purchase additional tickets on Oz Lotteries.  [Source: https://www.ozlotteries.com/blog/increase-your-chances-of-winning-the-lotto/]    The Odds of Winning Lotto How to Win Lotto  Lotto draws are games of chance in which you choose any 5, 6 or 7 numbers from 36 to 65 numbers, which is the case in the most popular world lotteries.  How to Win Lotto  Therefore, in the case of a lottery playing 45 numbers, such as Monday, Wednesday and Saturday Lotto in Australia, there are 8,145,060 unique combinations of six numbers which can be selected from 45 numbers. This means that you have a 1 in 8.145 million chance of correctly picking the 6 winning numbers from 45 numbers.  That’s why winning a Division One prize in any lotto is so difficult.  In other words, you would have to play all 8.145 million unique six-number combinations of the numbers 1 to 45 to be guaranteed of winning the major ‘pick-6’ Division 1 prize. By comparison, a lottery which only plays a pool of 40 numbers produces relatively more favourable odds with a 1 in 3.838 million chance of correctly picking the six winning numbers.  The National UK Lottery plays 6 from 49 numbers, in which case, the odds are an incredible 1 in almost 14 million!  The biggest jackpot lottery in the United States is Powerball USA, which picks 5 numbers from 69 plus 1 Powerball number from 1 to 26, has odds in excess of 175 million to one. Any wonder it’s biggest ever jackpot grew to a record USD$1.4 Billion in January, 2016, as no one could win it.  In Europe it is the Euromillions lottery where the odds of winning a prize are just 1 in 13. Most people, however, are more interested what the odds of winning the Euromillions jackpot are. The odds of matching all five balls and the 2 Lucky Stars to win the Jackpot is 1 in 116,531,800.  Having said all that, it still remains fact that every single lottery game you play is capable of winning a prize, including the jackpot. You can also look at it another way… every lotto game you play has 50% chance of winning. You either win or you don’t!    Lowering The Odds How to Win Lotto  Thankfully, the chances, or odds, of winning a lower division prize, by trapping only three, four or five of the winning numbers in one game, are significantly better.  Look at the table below, and reflect on the average number of winning games as documented each week by some of the world’s biggest lotteries.    how to win lotto    Here is the proof that winning the major jackpot prize is extremely rare. But, the important information here is the total amount of smaller prizes that are won.  Therefore, approximately 99.99% of all the prizes won in any major lottery in the world are earned by matching only three, four or five of the winning numbers.  Coupled with the fact that only 1 in 200 games played each week will win a prize – any prize – then these two facts require a shift in your thinking if you want to win at lotto.    What is a Systems Entry? How to Win Lotto  A system allows you to play more numbers than for a standard entry, providing you with an entry covering every combination of 6 numbers from the numbers you have chosen. This type of entry allows players to increase their chances of winning a prize by playing a wider range of number combinations.  Simply put, a system allows you to pick more than just the allowed 6 numbers for each lotto game. For instance, a “System 7” allows you to pick 7 numbers, while a “System 8” allows you to pick 8 numbers, and so on. The highest amount of numbers you can pick is 20 which is a “System 20”.  In a System, your entry is equivalent to playing every possible 6-number combination from your selected numbers. For instance, if you played a System 8 (which has 28 possible combinations), your entry is equivalent to playing all 28 possible combinations of 6 numbers from your 8 selections.  So here is a breakdown of how the System Entries can significantly lower the odds and increase your chance of winning quite substantially.    Monday, Wednesday and Saturday Australian Lotto – 8,145,060 : 1 odds to win a Division One prize by picking 6 numbers.  Formula:  (45 / 6)  x  (44 / 5)  x  (43 / 4)  x  (42 / 3)  x  (41 / 2)  x  (40 / 1) = 8,145,060    Monday, Wednesday and Saturday Australian Lotto – 96,920 : 1 odds to win a Division One prize by picking System 9 Entry numbers (picking 9 numbers from 1 to 45).  Formula:  (45 / 9)  x  (44 / 8)  x  (43 / 7)  x  (42 / 6)  x  (41 / 5)  x  (40 / 4) = 96,920    If you work it out the odds for a System 18 entry, they will be very low.  Monday, Wednesday and Saturday Australian Lotto – 439 : 1 odds to win a Division One prize by picking System 18 Entry numbers (picking 18 numbers from 1 to 45).  Formula:  (45 / 18)  x  (44 / 17)  x  (43 / 16)  x  (42 / 15)  x  (41 / 14)  x  (40 / 13) = 439.    Therefore, quite simply, playing Systems entries can easily lower the odds and increase the chances of winning a major prize significantly. A System 18 entry, choosing 18 numbers between 1 and 45, will give you a One in 439 chance of winning Division One and potentially becoming a millionaire.  Of course, these System Entries cost a lot more than single pick 6 number entries so it depends on how much money you are keen to outlay to reduce the odds and increase your chances of winning big.

What are your chances of winning Oz Lotto?                    By the end of today, Australians are set to gamble up to $500 million, but most are not aware of just how low their chances really are, says a leading probability expert.        Updated  Updated 26 August 2013          Professor Peter Taylor is an applied mathematician at the University of Melbourne and says the average punter should be made aware of the reality of their choices, especially when it comes to OZ Lotto's $100 million jackpot today.  “You've got to choose seven numbers out of 45. There are, roughly speaking, 45 million ways of doing that; 45,360,620 I think is the exact number,” he said.  That's double Australia's population.  “And if you bought more than one ticket, multiply that by two – that's still not much out of 45 million,” he said.  Based on 18 games, the odds remain 2,521,090 to one.  Professor Taylor says most people are not aware, despite the obvious logic, that the system is designed to provide dividends to the operator.  “Every time you buy a lottery ticket you are losing. The lottery on average makes more money out of each ticket than you do, they pay less back than the full price,”   Dr Darren Christensen is among Australia's leading experts in behavioural decision making, especially in problem gambling.  “The reason people gamble is that they are thinking about what they might do with the money and are distracted by the possibility of winning,” he said.  “They don't make an accurate assessment of what the chances really are."  He has studied gambling behaviors around the world and says Australia's relationship with gambling is unique.  "It's usual to have a day where the prohibitions about gambling are lowered –  'the race that stops a nation' is quite unusual.  “For the most part – gambling is recreation that most people don't have a problem with. It's a small group that do, but they have a significant problem."  But even an applied mathematician like Professor Taylor is not immune to the fever that grips Australia on Melbourne Cup day.  “There are reasons to get involved: you feel part of something, you get a thrill, there's the hope that's engendered by the chance of winning and they are all positive things.  "But on average you are going to lose.  "You're not on a winner. It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, but you should not do it if you are trying to make money.  “For me gambling is not a bad thing, but you should ever gamble anything you can afford to lose."  Will he, an applied mathematician, be placing a bet on the Cup today or buying an OZ Lotto ticket?  “Ah, no,” he said.

It’s winning TattsLotto. Ever since I was a kid, one question has popped up around the kitchen table, at the pub, over coffee, and even in bed: what would you do if you won TattsLotto?  Recently the dream took a bizarre twist as we followed the story of a seemingly average bloke in Victoria who collected money from his mates for years to run a syndicate , buying dream-rich lottery tickets.  Last year, he apparently quit work quite suddenly, bought a big house and a fast car and began a life of luxury. About the same time, an anonymous winner from Victoria had apparently collected A$16 million in the very same lottery the syndicate had been investing their hard earned money and dreams.  His mates became suspicious. He initially claimed his windfall was an inheritance. They went to court. They’ve now reached some sort of confidential deal , but discussions continue. Life goes on.  The lottery industry  The Tatts Group runs eight lotteries, including TattsLotto, Oz Lotto and Powerball. It’s the oldest continuous private lottery operator in the world. It began in 1881 when a Sydney publican ran a sweep on the Sydney Cup. His name was George Adams. A horse called Progress won that year, but the real winner was George. He went on to found what we now call the Tatts Group .  Each year, Australians gamble about A$20 billion. Pokies account for around A$12 billion, lotteries account for about A$2 billion. Getting exact figures is hard – but of that A$2 billion from lotteries, A$1.2 billion is returned in prize money. The other A$800 million is split between running costs, the Tatts Group and state governments.  That Australians like to gamble is obvious. But it’s mostly on the pokies, the races and, more recently, sports. Some run into trouble – problem gambling affects about half a million Australians . Although buying lottery tickets can occasionally stray into the problem gambling arena, it is rare.  The odds of winning the top prize in TattsLotto with one game are about one in eight million. The odds in Powerball are about one in 77 million. So if you bought one standard 12-game “quickpick” per week, you should win TattsLotto once every 13 thousand years, and Powerball once every 123 thousand years! Of course there are lesser prizes as well, and as they say – you’ve got to be in it to win it! But how many winners do you know?      Flickr/Robert S. Donovan    These odds are so stacked against us, it’s hard to accept we keep believing. But believe we do – every week. If you do win the top prize, you’re fixed for life. Wealth, travel, comfort, privileges… a worry-free existence. Apparently. It’s not the money we dream about, it’s the lifestyle. Winning TattsLotto represents life on easy street.  Does the dream match reality?  Occasionally, there are reports that winning the lottery will herald bad outcomes.  Fortunately, this is the exception not the rule. Not surprisingly, most people who win a lottery or have any big financial windfall have better overall mental health afterwards – meaning less episodes of depression and anxiety. When you ask people about their level of happiness, they report a short period of euphoria after the win, but over time their happiness returns to their pre-wealth level !  As for the dream of leaving your job and living on a beautiful island surrounded by staff… No. Most people stay in the same area and many continue to work in the same job. They just spend more. Similarly, for their general health, there is no big effect one way or the other. This is interesting: mostly wealth is associated with better health. Research suggests the benefits of a lottery win are offset by increased drinking and smoking.  So why do we buy lottery tickets?  Clearly the maths of entering any of the Tatts games doesn’t add up. If you genuinely believed you could make money through gambling, wouldn’t you choose games that didn’t keep 40% of the prize pool? Or buy shares in the companies that run the lotteries?  The only consistent winners of these games are the so-called Tattersalls heirs . After George Adams died childless in 1904, he left the company to a range of employees and a few politicians. Throughout the century, the shares passed through various wills and when the company went public in 2005, about 2,500 Tattersalls heirs reaped the rewards.  I don’t think we can blame the huge success of lotteries on a gambling instinct – gambling relies on intermittent unpredictable wins – and lottery wins are just too infrequent to fuel this human instinct. Gambling is just a small driver of lotteries.  So what’s it all about? To be honest, like most human behaviours, nobody really knows. My money is on the hope idea. Buying a TattsLotto ticket buys you a little bit of hope. A dream. You get to imagine life unencumbered by financial constraints.     holiday.  Flickr/saguarosally    You buy the opportunity to sit around and ponder what you’d do if you won. Here’s my list: a long holiday, a new car, a holiday house, a really big and fancy drum kit and reduce work to two days per week. I’d stay anonymous and I’d hire a lawyer, an accountant and a financial adviser. I’d also take care of karma and give some to charity and family!  Lottery tickets let you to do some planning – you ask yourself “What will make me happy?” It lets you compare notes with your friends “You’d quit? Not me, I’d buy the company and sack our idiot manager. Ha ha!” It gives you $8.55 worth of hope. A small price to pay.  As for the Geelong man at the centre of the current controversy – I suspect he’s learning that there’s a fine line between a dream and a nightmare. On the other hand, I’m also reminded of flamboyant pianist Liberace’s catch phrase: “I cried all the way to the bank.”        Previous post  May 15, 2015 Injecting regulations into cosmetic medicine       Next post  February 24, 2016 When it comes to mental health, like attracts like           Tweet     Share      Get newsletter  Newsletter               Most popular on The Conversation   Rights of the dead and the living clash when scientists extract DNA from human remains  Why the Christian right opposes pornography but still supports Trump  How Cambridge Analytica’s Facebook targeting model really worked – according to the person who built it  Why prime numbers still fascinate mathematicians, 2,300 years later  Why you stink at fact-checking    I’m suing Scott Pruitt’s broken EPA - here’s how to fix it  How kindness can make a difference in cancer care  What might explain the unhappiness epidemic?

The numbers they chose were 5, 12, 34, 33, 42, with supplementary numbers 30 and 32. That&apos;s right —   32, 33, 34 , all in the one draw. How did that pattern fit with your usual plan of choosing family birthdays and your house number? Perhaps the lucky numbers from Saturday, December 19, 2009, might have suited you better — they included 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 23 and supplementaries 26 and 41. It&apos;s hard to imagine marking that many close together, and yet there were 27 winners to share the $4 million division-one prize that Saturday night. Get the latest Australian Lotto results The truth is, everyone has a different method for choosing lucky lotto numbers. There is only one certainty: that your chances of winning are about one in 2 million with a basic four-game pick. Mind you, they&apos;re not bad odds when you consider that with Oz Lotto you&apos;re looking at a one in 11 million chance and with Powerball it&apos;s one in 14 million. "That&apos;s what you call lucky," says Professor John Croucher of the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, an expert in statistics and author of Number Crunch  (Pan Australia, 2006) and The Secret Language  (ABC Books). "It&apos;s what we call a &apos;statistical variation&apos; — a boring term for what everyone else calls &apos;luck&apos;. There&apos;s a random element in all gambling and it&apos;s not possible to predict who will win." The Gary Ablett factor So what is the best way to choose numbers? Some people like to choose numbers that come up all the time. Others go with those that are not so frequent. Visit the NSW Lotteries website and you&apos;ll find a "Number Selector" tool that allows you to track both with the push of one button. In case you were wondering, John Vineburg from NSW Lotteries offers the following information about Oz Lotto&apos;s luckiest and unluckiest numbers: Lucky: 3, 35, 13, 17, 33, 26 and 25. Unlucky: 36, 42, 38, 30, 24, 14 and 10. Be aware, though, that statistically it makes no difference as to whether your lucky seven comes out every week or once in a blue moon. "I know that people have theories that some numbers are luckier than others because they come up more frequently, while others say that infrequent numbers are overdue," Croucher says. "Realistically, it doesn&apos;t matter. Lotto numbers have no memory. There&apos;s no emotion involved and no memory." In Geelong, they might disagree. According to the Geelong Advertiser , AFL footballer Gary Ablett Jr is proving lucky for many local residents. Ablett, who picked up a premiership and the Brownlow Medal with the Geelong Cats in 2009, plays in guernsey 29 — a number which appeared for three Geelong division one Tattslotto winners in 2009. The secret to winning Of course, it may not be which numbers you choose, but where you choose them that makes the difference. Greystanes in NSW topped the list of Australia&apos;s top 20 lotto-winning suburbs for 2009, now being home to $9.4 million in new Lotto winnings. But that amount was shared between only two winners. If you&apos;re looking for the spot that struck it lucky the most often, you&apos;d need to travel to Perth in WA or Campbelltown in NSW, with four winners each. So you have to ask, are they winning more often because they&apos;re buying more tickets in these places? "That&apos;s not necessarily true," Croucher says. "You could buy one and I could buy 50 and you could still win. Of course, it does increase your chances if you buy more tickets, but it doesn&apos;t guarantee a win. Basically, the luckiest suburbs are random, and it all comes back to that statistical variation." Which means that hightailing it to Greystanes to buy your next ticket won&apos;t necessarily improve your chances of a big win. Whether you use a dartboard, astrology, numerology, special dates, or whim to choose your numbers, play the same numbers religiously for years or change them each week depending on the weather conditions, there&apos;s only one way to improve your chances of winning: buy a ticket. "If you don&apos;t buy a ticket, the chances of winning are easy to calculate," Croucher says, who admits to going the autopick option to choose his numbers. "That is, there&apos;s no chance of winning at all."

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

(November 2010)     Lotteries in Australia include various lottery related products licensed by the Lott and Lotterywest Australian lottery companies. Lotteries operators are licensed at a state or territory level, and include both state government -owned, not-for-profit and private sector  companies . Most major Lotteries have now moved into the online marketplace.

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

(November 2010)     Lotteries in Australia include various lottery related products licensed by the Lott and Lotterywest Australian lottery companies. Lotteries operators are licensed at a state or territory level, and include both state government -owned, not-for-profit and private sector  companies . Most major Lotteries have now moved into the online marketplace.

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

(November 2010)     Lotteries in Australia include various lottery related products licensed by the Lott and Lotterywest Australian lottery companies. Lotteries operators are licensed at a state or territory level, and include both state government -owned, not-for-profit and private sector  companies . Most major Lotteries have now moved into the online marketplace.

It operates under the " Tatts " brand in Victoria , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory . It also manages Queensland's Golden Casket Lottery Corporation (which it took over from the Queensland government in 2007 [1] ), New South Wales Lotteries in NSW and the ACT [2] and South Australian Lotteries in South Australia and  Intralot Australia , which operates under "Intralot" in Tasmania;  The publicly listed Jumbo Interactive , an online re-seller of lotteries operating as Ozlotteries.  The privately owned company Netlotto , an online re-seller of lotteries via the www.netlotto.com.au website.   From 2007 to 2014 Intralot Australia held a lottery licence to sell Instant Scratch-its, Keno and bingo tickets in Victoria. The licence was sold to Tatts Group on October 2014. [3]  State government-owned corporations were once a major sector in the industry. However, with Tatts taking over operation of all state-owned lotteries (though the states still retain legal ownership), the only remaining state owned-and-operated lottery in Australia is Lotterywest in Western Australia .  Although the organisations are predominantly state-based, Australia has a number of national lottery games. Currently, Tattersall's and the state-owned lotteries operate as a bloc to jointly conduct the national games, pooling their entries and winnings. For example, Tattersall's administers the Saturday Lotto (known as Tattslotto in its jurisdictions), Oz Lotto and Powerball games on behalf of the bloc; similarly, South Australian Lotteries operate the Australian Soccer Pools on behalf of the other operators. The major operators also market lottery games traditionally running in their own jurisdiction, however recently some of these have become "multi-state" games, if not national.  On June 1, 2016 Tattersall's created a national lottery brand called ‘ the Lott ’. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website https://thelott.com .  Australian lotteries are subject to many regulations, which generally vary by state. The minimum age to purchase lottery products is 18 in all states except for Western Australia, where the age was lowered to 16. [4]  Most Australian lottery tickets do not include retailer sales commission; purchases often are not to the whole dollar.  Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto [ edit ]  Saturday Lotto is a national Saturday night draw conducted by Tattersall's , and is syndicated to all Australian states and territories through the Australian Lotto Bloc . The game is marketed as Tattslotto in Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and the Northern Territory ; as Gold Lotto in Queensland ; as X Lotto in South Australia and as Lotto or Saturday Lotto in New South Wales , and Western Australia.  In the absence of poker machines, the Victorian state government awarded Tattersall's the right to conduct a weekly lottery to raise additional revenue to complement the state's health system funding. The first Tattslotto draw, with a first division prize of A$50,000, was on 24 June 1972, televised on HSV-7  Melbourne .  Tattslotto, which was the first of its type in Australia, was originally based on the European style lotteries, where six numbers are selected from 40 in a standard game. Each week, six numbers and one supplementary number were mechanically drawn from a transparent barrel. Each televised draw was live-to air and witnessed by three officials, one from Tattersalls and two representatives from the government. From Draw 413, on 6 July 1985, the current standard game format, six from 45, was introduced to decrease the chances at winning a prize. Also from this draw, an additional supplementary number was drawn.  Originally, players would complete an entry ticket of between two and 10 games, at a cost of A$0.60 cents per game. The ticket consisted of an original and a carbon copy. The player would present the ticket to an agent/seller who would validate both copies of the ticket by inserting the ticket into a designated cash register. The copy would be returned to the player and the original would be kept by the agent/seller and sent to Tattersalls prior to the next draw. In the 80s, the network of agents/sellers were computerised. This allowed a later closing time for each draw, scannable entries with printed tickets, randomly selected computer-generated tickets (known variously as a "Quick Pick", "Pick Quick", "Auto-Pick", "Easi-Pick" or "Slikpik"), more games per draw to be purchased, etc.  Variations to the standard game are commonly known as a System entry. These games cost extra but allow the player to increase their chances of winning. The more numbers selected per game, the greater the outlay. Subsequently, if the selected numbers are drawn, multiple prizes are won.  Currently, the game offers an estimated First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million "Superdraws" taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. [5] In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with jackpots of around $30 million. If there is no division 1 winner in Tattslotto it jackpots to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased at a cost of $0.65 per game, plus agent's commission.  The following prize divisions can be won:    Division  Winning Numbers Required  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6  1 in 8,145,060    2nd Division  5 + supplementary  1 in 678,755    3rd Division  5  1 in 34,808    4th Division  4  1 in 733    5th Division  3 + one or both supplementary  1 in 297    6th Division  1 or 2 + 2 supplementary numbers  1 in 144    Any Prize   1 in 85    Monday & Wednesday Lotto [ edit ]  Monday & Wednesday Lotto is a lotto game played in all states and territories. It started life as a New South Wales -only game administered by New South Wales Lotteries , with its first draw on 5 November 1979. Its current logo (as promoted in its home state) features a large red "1" Lotto ball, originally referred to as "The Big One". NSW Lotto was the only lotto game played in the state until the introduction of Oz Lotto in 1994 – New South Wales being the last state to join Saturday Lotto, in 2000.  NSW Lotto began expanding interstate on 1 May 2006, when the lotteries commissions in South Australia and Western Australia started selling tickets, [6] replacing SA Lotto in the process. From 13 October 2008, Tattersall's started selling Monday and Wednesday Lotto to its territories – having earlier lost the right to run Wednesday Tattslotto after June. Queensland's Golden Casket began selling tickets in Monday & Wednesday Lotto (maintaining the Gold Lotto brand) on 21 October 2013. [7]  In South Australia, this game is known as X Lotto – being its historical brand in that state. The name returned with the Monday 17 May 2010 draw (after being previously branded as simply "Lotto"), coinciding with a new lotteries system – one change of which was the ability to again recognise crosses (as opposed to vertical markings) on the Lotto entry form. [8]  Since April 2004, the game has been identical to Saturday Lotto: six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 45 balls, and its five winning divisions are identical. Entries cost $0.55 per game plus agent's commission.  Both Monday and Wednesday draws carry a Division 1 prize of $1 million for each winner. [9] Occasional Monday night "superdraws" are also conducted, with a $5 million Division 1 pool.  Changes [ edit ]  NSW Lotto has seen a number of changes since its introduction in 1979: [10]   Originally a Monday-only game, a second "mid-week" draw was added on 21 November 1984. Originally on Wednesday, this was moved to Thursday between 1989 and 1996. It was returned to Wednesday following the introduction of Powerball on Thursday nights.  Originally a 40-ball game, the game was first expanded to 44 balls, and then to the current 45. The latest change, introduced on 19 April 2004, brought the NSW game in line with Saturday Lotto.  A second supplementary number was added on 20 August 1990.  NSW Lotto previously [ when? ] offered a "Double Up" option for an extra $0.15 per game, which doubled any winning Division 2 to 5 prizes. This was eliminated by the time Tattersall's joined the game.  From 19 April 2004 until 1 May 2006:  Divisions 4 and 5 had fixed prizes of $20 and $10, respectively.  Division 1 did not jackpot, and instead a "cash rolldown" applied: if there was no Division 1 winner, all Division 2 to 5 prizes were doubled. (Where Double Up was entered, the rolldown did not double the Double Up portion of the prize, effectively "tripling up" the original prize.)    From 26 February 2012 [9]   Division 1 has a fixed prize of $1 million for each winner.  Division 1 no longer jackpots.  Division 6 added.    Televised Lotto draws were shown only on the Nine Network 's GO! Channel during the coverage of the London Olympics from July–August 2012, they continued to air on the Nine Network up until they aired for the last time on 30 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, Televised Lotto draws began to air solely on GO! as part of changes to the classification code of practice.   Oz Lotto [ edit ]  Main article: Oz Lotto  Oz Lotto is a national lottery game, administered by Tattersall's and played on Tuesday nights. It was introduced on 26 February 1994 and promoted as the first fully national lotto game, at a time when New South Wales was not a part of Saturday Lotto. Entries cost $1.20 per game plus agents commission.  Originally, the game was the same as Saturday Lotto, requiring six numbers to be picked out of 45. However, starting 18 October 2005, a seventh number began to be drawn, greatly lengthening the odds of winning Division 1 (close, but not longer, than that of Powerball). In line with this change, branding for Oz Lotto changed in many states, to emphasise the seventh ball (including new names, such as Super 7's Oz Lotto in Tatts regions, and Oz 7 Lotto in Queensland. However, as of 2012, the game has reverted to the branding of Oz Lotto in these regions). Oz Lotto guarantees a minimum division one prize pool of $2 million.  Oz Lotto currently holds the record for the largest Australian lotto jackpot prize. Originally guaranteed at $100 million, four winners shared a Division 1 pool of $111,972,151.04 in the draw on 6 November 2012. [11]  Although the draw now requires seven numbers to be selected, the minimum prize level (of 3 winning numbers and one of the supplementary numbers) was unchanged, thus leading to seven prize divisions:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7  1 in 45,379,620    2nd Division  6 + supplementary  1 in 3,241,401    3rd Division  6  1 in 180,078    4th Division  5 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 29,602    5th Division  5  1 in 3,430    6th Division  4  1 in 154    7th Division  3 + one or both supplementaries  1 in 87    Any Prize   1 in 55    Powerball [ edit ]  Main article: Powerball (Australia)  Powerball is a lottery game modelled on the highly successful American Powerball game. The game is administered by Tattersall's , and syndicated to all states through the Australian Lotto Bloc. Draws take place on Thursday nights, with the first draw held on 23 May 1996. Each Powerball game costs 85 cents plus agent's commission, with most states requiring standard games be bought four at a time.  Powerball uses two barrels to determine its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball , is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player needs to have all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers as well as a Powerball for each game line.  Powerball offers slightly better odds overall for winning any prize than Saturday Lotto, partly due to its eight-division structure; however, its first division is about nine times harder to win:    Division  Required Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 76,767,600    2nd Division  6  1 in 4,040,400    3rd Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 376,312    4th Division  5  1 in 19,806    5th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 9,123    6th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 641    7th Division  4  1 in 480    8th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 110    Any prize   1 in 78    On 13 April 2018, the format of Powerball will change to 7 regular balls being drawn at random from a barrel of 35 as well as a powerball being drawn at random from a barrel of 20. The new format contains nine divisions, increasing the odds of winning an overall prize but decreasing the odds of winning the jackpot. The divisions are as follows:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    1st Division  7 + Powerball  1 in 134,490,440    2nd Division  7  1 in 7,078,444    3rd Division  6 + Powerball  1 in 686,176    4th Division  6  1 in 36,115    5th Division  5 + Powerball  1 in 16,943    6th Division  4 + Powerball  1 in 1,173    7th Division  5  1 in 892    8th Division  3 + Powerball  1 in 188    9th Division  2 + Powerball  1 in 65    Any Prize   1 in 44    Systems entries are available on Powerball, however only one Powerball is selected for a standard system entry. Players can also purchase an entry that guarantees the Powerball for a game entry – this costs the same as playing 20 individual games. This is known in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tatts' states as a "PowerHit", and in Western Australia as a "Powerpik". System entries and guaranteed Powerball options can sometimes be combined.  A major difference between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, if it is the Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its players do not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.  Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $80 million, which was shared between two tickets (in Victoria and New South Wales) on 30 July 2009. [12]  Keno [ edit ]  Games of keno are run by one lottery organisation: South Australian Lotteries . Tattersall's previously offered Tatts Keno until the end of June 2008, at which point it lost its Victorian government licence to run the game. It has been replaced by the Intralot-run Lucky Keno .  SA Lotteries Keno [ edit ]  SA Lotteries' Keno operates on a continuous basis of one draw every 3.5 minutes, with draws closing 40 seconds before each draw. Results appear on monitors located at most lotteries sales outlets. South Australian Keno can be played using all Spot entries from 1 to 10 numbers. It offers one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket, with a minimum prize of $1 million (which was changed from a $1 million fixed prize to a jackpotting prize in February 2001).  Since November 1997, SA Lotteries has syndicated Keno to the Australian Capital Territory 's ACTTAB, [13] where it is marketed as ACTTAB Keno .  In May 2010, a "Keno Coin Toss" side-bet feature was added to Keno, which pay on which half of the board ("Heads": numbers 1–40; "Tails": numbers 41–80 – each paying $2 per $1 bet) has more drawn numbers, or whether they are equal, with ten numbers drawn in each half ("Evens" – paying $4 per $1 bet).  Other Operators [ edit ]  Keno is also popular in clubs, hotels and casinos. Tabcorp Holdings , through its ownership of Jupiters Limited , runs Keno draws through their casinos in New South Wales and Queensland, and also other gaming venues in these states and in Victoria. SKYCITY Darwin runs NT Keno on behalf of venues in the Northern Territory.  Both these games run continuously (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer jackpots for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno also has a Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails? , which pre-date and are played identically to the current "Coin Toss" feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a "runner" in a "race" of eight, with positions based on the number and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as "Win", "Place", "Trifecta" and so on.  Set For Life [ edit ]  Set For Life is currently Australia's newest lottery. Its inaugural draw was held on Friday 7 August 2015. The game was originally announced in February 2015.  Tatts Chief Executive Robbie Cook told the Sydney Morning Herald [14] at the time that "it's everyday dreaming. It's not somebody looking to stop working and hang up their shoes." He also told the publication that the game was specifically aimed at, and designed for, a younger audience, primarily those aged between 20 and 40. The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.  Game Structure [ edit ]  Set For Life differs significantly from other Australian lotteries, in that the top prize is not paid out in one lump sum, but rather as a fixed sum of $20,000 AUD per month over the course of 20 years (unless more than four people win the top prize in which case the total prize pool of $19,200,000 is split evenly between the winners via monthly instalments, e.g. If 5 people win the top prize each will receive $16,000 a month). Other prize divisions are paid in full, however. There are eight prize tiers in total and draws are held every single day at 9pm AEST.  To play you pick a "Set" of eight numbers from a range of one to 37. [15] This set will then be entered into the next seven days draws and you must play a minimum of two sets to participate.  Two bonus numbers are drawn after the main eight numbers, giving ten numbers drawn in total. These numbers are used to determine other prizes. To win the jackpot, you must match all eight regular numbers:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Set)    1st Division  8  1 in 38,608,020    2nd Division  7 + bonus number  1 in 2,413,001    3rd Division  7  1 in 178,741    4th Division  6 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 25,070    5th Division  6  1 in 3,928    6th Division  5 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 946    7th Division  5  1 in 236    8th Division  4 + one or both bonus numbers  1 in 89    Any Prize   1 in 59    Trackside [ edit ]  There is also a computerised racing game is known as Trackside, [16] where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours . Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless of how many people are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses , but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext , but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions ). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also "mystery" bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.  Super 66 [ edit ]  Super 66 is an Australian lottery game played in all states except New South Wales (which plays Lotto Strike instead). It is a product of Tattersalls and is played on a Saturday night, drawn just after the main Tattslotto draw. Super 66 costs $1.10 per game. A six-digit "winning number" is drawn, and players win prizes by matching either its first or last digits.  It is intended as an "add-on" game, in that most states require that a Super 66 entry can only be bought in conjunction with another game (usually Saturday Lotto, although some states allow buying Super 66 with other lotto games). Super 66 entries are usually computer-generated although some states allow registered players to record their favourite Super 66 numbers and play them like in other games.  To win First Division, players must match the winning number with their entry exactly. Otherwise, fixed consolation prizes are won if at least the first two or last two digits match. Using 123456 as an example drawn number, there are five divisions:    Division  Example Winning Numbers  Probability (Single Game)  Fixed Prize    1st Division  123456  1 in 1,000,000  Jackpot, minimum $16,666.00    2nd Division  12345 x or x 23456  1 in 55,556  $6,666.00    3rd Division  1234 xx or xx 3456  1 in 5,556  $666.00    4th Division  123 xxx or xxx 456  1 in 556  $66.00    5th Division  12 xxxx or xxxx 56  1 in 56  $6.60    Any Prize   1 in 50     The First Division prize can jackpot for 25 consecutive weeks (as of 20 January 2007 [17] ). On the 26th draw with no winners, the jackpot is "rolled down" to the next highest division with winners.  Soccer Pools [ edit ]  The Australian Soccer Pools (usually branded as The Pools or Soccer Pools ) is a national lotto-type game, administered by SA Lotteries . Rather than being drawn at random, winning numbers are selected based on the results of association football matches, either in Australia (typically state leagues) or the northern hemisphere depending on the time of year. Six winning numbers are selected from 38, but only one supplementary number. Draws close on Saturday afternoon where Australian games are used, or Saturday evening in the case of Northern Hemisphere match weeks. It was previously branded as 6 From 38 Pools in New South Wales , but the state now uses the national The Pools brand. Entries cost $0.50 per game plus agent's commission.  Matches are drawn from a match list and numbered, currently 1–60. Those numbered 1–38 are the ones generally used, with the remainder being reserve matches , which replace any matches from the first 38 which are postponed or otherwise voided. Once all game results are known, games are ranked in this order, from highest to lowest: [18]   Drawn games, with higher scoring draws ranking higher (e.g. a 3–3 result will rank higher than 2–2), and scoreless draws (0–0) ranking lowest;  Away team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference ranking higher (e.g. a 2–3 result will rank higher than 1–3), followed by total goals scored (e.g. 2–3 will rank higher than 1–2); and  Home team wins, with scores with a smaller goal difference again ranking higher, followed by total goals scored.   Once the games have been ranked, the numbers of the six highest-ranked games become the winning numbers, with the seventh becoming the supplementary. In the case of any ties (i.e. two games with the same score), the higher game number is ranked higher (i.e. game 38 highest, 1 lowest).  Where reserve matches are required, they are used in order starting from 39, and substitute voided matches starting from lowest to highest. Where less than 38 matches in total are played, state rules vary as to whether the remaining winning numbers are drawn from a barrel, [18] or whether to cancel the draw entirely and re-enter all entries into the next Pools draw. [19] [20]  The Pools offers the same five divisions as Saturday Lotto; the odds of winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but jackpots often:    Division  Required numbers  Probability (single game)    Division 1  6  1 in 2,760,681    Division 2  5 + supplementary  1 in 460,114    Division 3  5  1 in 14,842    Division 4  4  1 in 371    Division 5  3 + supplementary  1 in 297    State Lotto Draws [ edit ]  In addition to the Saturday Tattslotto draw, most states and territories' lottery corporations hold their own lottery draws, playable only in their state (or states, in the case of Tattersalls ) of their jurisdiction.  Lotto Strike [ edit ]  Lotto Strike , launched in 1995 is a statewide companion game to NSW Lotto played in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only, and administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Originally based on NSW Lotto's Monday and Wednesday draws, Lotto Strike also became available for play on Saturday Lotto after the midweek NSW Lotto changes in 2004 (instead of Super 66). Lotto Strike costs $1 per game plus agent's commission, and must be bought at the same time as a normal Lotto entry for that draw.  Lotto Strike's winning numbers are the first four balls drawn in order from the corresponding Lotto draw. To win a prize, players must match at least one of their selected balls in the same position as the winning numbers (e.g. player's 2nd number matchies winning 2nd number, etc.). Numbers can be selected manually or through computer "auto-pick". Entries can also be "boxed", producing 24 standard games allowing the numbers to be matched in any order.  The odds of winning Strike Four with a single game is 1 in 3,575,880. There are four prize divisions, named after the number of balls correctly matched in their position:    Division  Required Numbers  Probability (Single Game)    Division 1 (Strike Four)  Four numbers in the correct position  1 in 3,575,880    Division 2 (Strike Three)  Three numbers in the correct position  1 in 21,804    Division 3 (Strike Two)  Two numbers in the correct position  1 in 346    Division 4 (Strike One)  One number in the correct position  1 in 12    The Strike Four jackpot starts at $100,000 and increases with each draw, depending on sales. Due to the relative unpopularity of Lotto Strike, jackpots occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further jackpots being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.  Although New South Wales is the only state in Australia that plays Lotto Strike, the format is also played in New Zealand with their national Lotto game.  Cash 3 [ edit ]  Cash 3 is a lottery game played in Western Australia and administered by Lotterywest . The Cash 3 format is also used in several places in the United States. It is drawn daily and the numbers telecast on Channel Seven in Perth , and on GWN in regional Western Australia.  Players select three digits, and may choose to bet on those three digits being drawn in any order, in that specific order, or both. Games can be played for either 50 cents or $1.00, and can be bought up to seven days in advance. Prizes are fixed according to the probability of winning, with the highest possible prize being $500 for a "straight-up" $1 wager.  Draw Lotteries [ edit ]  This section refers to 'traditional' draw style lotteries offered by Australian lottery organisations. In this type of game, a set number of tickets – typically in the low six figures – are offered for sale in each draw. A set of numbers are then drawn (these days by a random number generator) and are awarded prizes, with many consolation prizes often offered.  Lucky Lotteries [ edit ]  Lucky Lotteries is the current brand name given to draw lotteries administered by Tattersalls , after originally being administered by New South Wales Lotteries . Currently, two lotteries are run under this name: Super Jackpot and Mega Jackpot . (Both denominations exclude agent's commission.) Since March 2015, the lotteries have been available in Tattersalls jurisdictions.  All tickets are "auto-picked" by the computer and are usually allocated sequentially, but those buying 10 numbers or less can have their numbers selected at random. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 draws in advance for Super Jackpot and two draws for Mega Jackpot.  Draws are conducted soon after all tickets are sold at the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means that a number of weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.  In each draw, a first, second and third prize is drawn, as well as a number of smaller prizes down to $10. One-off prizes are awarded to tickets that are one ticket number either side of each cash prize, with a $1,000 cash prize for being one-off first prize, and a number of free tickets for an advance draw of the same lottery for being one-off any other cash prize. (Free tickets are always awarded as a sequential run of numbers.)  A jackpot ticket number is then drawn, separately from the main draw.A jackpot ticket can only be one of the previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the "6-from-45" Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. [21] The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011. [22]  The differences between the $2 and $5 Jackpot Lotteries can be summarised by the following table (current as to 1 March 2018):    Characteristic  $2 Jackpot Lottery  $5 Jackpot Lottery    Maximum Number of Tickets  270,000  200,000    Total Number of Prizes*  11,896  12,655    First Prize  $100,000  $200,000    Minimum Jackpot  $500,000  $1,000,000    Jackpot Increment  $130,000  $240,000    Odds of Winning Jackpot  1 in 18,385,876  1 in 9,483,167    Odds of Winning a Cash Prize  1 in 68.1  1 in 47.4    Odds of Winning Any Prize  1 in 23.03  1 in 16.14     Total Number of Prizes : includes one-off prizes and one prize for a non-winning jackpot ticket number.   Former Games [ edit ]  New South Wales Lotteries have also conducted a number of $10 draw lotteries in the past. The most recent $10 lottery conducted was called Lucky 7 , which replaced the Million Dollar Lottery (a non-jackpotting draw lottery that was otherwise similar to the $2 and $5 games) in 1996 and continued until 2001. [23] Each $10 ticket was entered for five consecutive weekly draws.  Three separate numbers were drawn, named after the number of digits in each winning number: Lucky 7 (with numbers ranging from 1000000-1999999), Lucky 6 (100000-449999) and Lucky 3 (000-999). Prizes were awarded in a similar manner to Super 66, with a $1 million prize offered for matching the Lucky 7 number exactly, while consolation prizes were awarded for matching the last digits of the other numbers – as few as three digits for the Lucky 6, or two digits for the Lucky 3 number.  South Australia: LuckySA Lottery [ edit ]  SA Lotteries conducted one LuckySA Lottery draw, launched in June 2007, [24] and conducted on 2 January 2008. This $5 draw lottery [25] offered a top prize of $500,000 and a total of 18 prize-winning numbers (down to $50) out of a maximum of 200,000 tickets. As of 2010, no further draws have been conducted.  Former Lottery Games [ edit ]  W  SA Lotto [ edit ]  SA Lotto , previously known as Cross Lotto or X Lotto , was a statewide lottery game played only in South Australia, and administered by South Australian Lotteries . At its winding up, the game was played twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Games of SA Lotto cost 30 cents plus agent's commission, and offered a $400,000 guaranteed minimum prize for Division One. SA Lotto was replaced with an expanded version of NSW Lotto on 1 May 2006; the game is simply marketed as Lotto , in line with the Saturday version, replacing the SA Lotto brand. (The X Lotto brand was replaced with Lotto and SA Lotto in 1999, since crosses on entry forms were no longer accepted – but was reinstated in May 2010. [8] )  The draw format was the same as for the Saturday draw, with six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers drawn from 45. SA Lotto was notable in that there were six divisions instead of five, with an additional division for games with four matching winning numbers, plus a supplementary number. The First Division pool was last increased, from $300,000 to $400,000, in November 2003, at the same time as the re-introduction of a mid-week draw on Wednesdays, which had previously been replaced by Powerball. [13]  Wednesday Tattslotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Tattslotto was a product of Tattersalls and was played in their territories ( Victoria , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ). Started in February 2000, six winning numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn from 40 balls – less than the Saturday version of the game. Each game cost 50 cents plus agent's commission. As with Tatts Keno, Tatts Scratchies and Tatts 2, Tattersalls were not permitted to operate these games under the Victorian government licensing regime which commenced on 1 July 2008.  Prize divisions were the same as Saturday Tattslotto, with a minimum First Division prize of $100,000 – the odds of winning were 1 in 3,838,380, or about twice as likely as the Saturday draw. However, they were slightly easier to win due to the reduced number of balls used.  Wednesday Gold Lotto [ edit ]  Wednesday Gold Lotto was a statewide lottery game played in Queensland , and administered by Golden Casket , the Queensland Lotteries Corporation. Started in 1996, [26] Wednesday Gold Lotto was played like Saturday Lotto, with games costing 50 cents each plus agent's commission.  The main point of difference being in its unusual First Division system: instead of offering a jackpotting prize pool shared by all Division 1 winners, Wednesday Gold Lotto guaranteed a fixed $1 million prize for up to four separate winners in each draw, with the $4 million prize pool only being divided among its winners if more than four match all six numbers in one draw. Unclaimed first division prizes were used to fund future Division 1 prizes, or for other promotional purposes.  The final Queensland-only Wednesday Gold Lotto draw was held on 16 October 2013, with Golden Casket joining the national Monday & Wednesday Lotto draws (branded Monday & Wednesday Gold Lotto) from 21 October 2013.  Casket [ edit ]  Casket (or the $2 Casket ) was the name given to the draw lottery administered by Queensland 's lottery operator, Golden Casket . The name of the game dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. [27] The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013. [28]  Draws were held about seven times a year (the draw dates of which are fixed in advance), and a maximum of 110,000 tickets (at $2 each) were sold for each draw. Specific numbers could be selected by the player when buying a Casket ticket (as long as the number has not already been selected), or otherwise automatically allocated through a Quick Pick.  Each draw had a first prize of $100,000, and consolation prizes were drawn to as low as $5. There was no jackpot component. One-off prizes were also drawn, although unlike New South Wales these were paid in cash, with the most common prize being $2 for being one-off any the numbers outside the first three prizes. There were 7,089 prizes awarded in each $2 Casket draw (including one-off prizes), making the odds of winning any prize around 1 in 15.5.  Tatts 2 [ edit ]  Tatts 2 was a Tattersall's product played only in its territories. It is one of the simplest games that can be played. A player selected 2 numbers from (1–99) in each game; which cost 55c. Each night at about 7:00 two numbers from (1–99) were drawn.  Those players matching either number won a fixed prize of $3. Those matching both numbers then shared the remainder of the prize pool, with a minimum prize of $500. In some draws (usually once a week), both the 1 Number prize and the 2 Number minimum prize were doubled. The odds of matching both numbers with a single entry was 1 in 4,851.  There was the provision for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot for five weeks before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However jackpots very rarely occurred.  Tatts Keno [ edit ]  Tatts Keno was administered by Tattersall's and played in most areas that offer their lottery products ( Victoria , Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory ) – Tatts Keno could not be played in the Northern Territory . Tatts Keno was a nightly game, and entries could vary from 3 to 10 spots.  Tatts Keno offered one jackpot prize, for matching all numbers from a Spot 10 ticket. The minimum jackpot prize was $250,000, however this often increased to over $1 million as it tended to take a large number of draws for the jackpot to be won. Tatts Keno was replaced by Intralot's Lucky Keno 70 from 1 July 2008.  Intralot [ edit ]  From 1 July 2008, Intralot was introduced into Victoria following changes to lottery licensing by the Victorian Government , and was subsequently introduced into Tasmania. After originally branding its games under the name The Luck Factory , Intralot now brands its lotteries using its own name. However, Intralot announced on 25 October 2014, that they would cease operating in Victoria, [29] with effect from 1 February 2015.  Games that were conducted by Intralot include:  Lucky Bingo Star [ edit ]  First drawn on 6 July 2008, and drawn each Sunday at 8pm. Although known officially in rules and Intralot's licence as TV Bingo , [30] the draw is currently broadcast live on radio instead, through 3AW .  Entries cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), with a minimum purchase of 3 games, and can only be purchased via "quick pick". Prizes are won for matching the four corners, or a diagonal cross, within the first 25 numbers, or a "full house" within 50 numbers (with odds of 1:212,085). A jackpot "snowball" prize (minimum $500,000) is won if a "full house" is made within 44 numbers (odds of 1:14,638,344).  In the original incarnation, the diagonal cross was allowed to be made within 27 numbers, the corners within 28, and further numbers would be drawn until the "full house" prize was won. [31]  Lucky Lines [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 July 2008, and drawn daily at 7pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission), and requires the selection of numbers in a 3x3 grid, with the centre square provided "free", and five numbers to be selected in each other square, starting from numbers 1–5 in the top-left, up to 36–40 in the bottom-right. Prizes are won for how many lines of three numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are matched, with a jackpot (minimum $9,000) for matching all eight numbers and therefore, all eight lines. Known as Cross and Match in Intralot's licence, and the official rules. [32]  Lucky 5 Red or Black [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and drawn daily at 7:30pm. Games cost $0.55 each (including agent's commission) with a minimum of two games. Five numbers from 35 are drawn, plus either "red" or "black". A jackpot (minimum $50,000) is won for matching all five numbers plus the correct colour, with fixed minor prizes down to four numbers, or three with the correct colour.  Lucky 3 [ edit ]  First drawn on 1 June 2009, and similar to Lotterywest's Cash 3 game above: a three-digit number is drawn each night at 6:30pm. Games cost $1.10 each (including agent's commission). Exact matches of the number win a fixed $500 prize; matches of the number in "any order" win a fixed $20 prize. Unlike Cash 3, the "any order" wins are a consolation prize to the "exact order" major prize, rather than a separate bet.  Lucky Keno [ edit ]  Lucky Keno is a keno game operated by Intralot, and played in their territories of Victoria and Tasmania. It is drawn daily at 8:00pm (Melbourne time). The game started as Lucky Keno 70 , with 20 numbers drawn from 70 (instead of the traditional 80) twice a day. The original game had a Spot 10/Match 10 prize of $ 400,000, and a "bonus" wager offered a jackpot which increased this to a minimum of $1 million.  Starting from 15 March 2010 (Draw 1245), Lucky Keno was changed to a 20-from-80 game drawn once a day, with a fixed A$2 million prize for Spot 10/Match 10 [33] – matching the previous maximum jackpot prize of its predecessor, Tatts Keno. Wagers can be made with between 3 and 10 "spotted" numbers.  As Lucky Keno 70 , a "Hi-Lo" bet was also available, which won if 13 or more numbers fell on the correctly predicted half of the available balls (Low: numbers 1–35; High: numbers 36–70). The bonus wager and the Hi-Lo game is no longer available since 15 March 2010.  Instants (Scratchies) [ edit ]  All Australian lottery companies offer "Scratchies" or instants which can be purchased at outlets. Players scratch and try to match numbers, complete puzzles or reveal codes to obtain a prize. Instants come in many varieties, usually at $1, $1.10, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, $15 and $20 price levels. Although games are often shared between lottery companies, scratchies purchased in one Australian state are not often exchangeable in another.  Superdraw [ edit ]  A Superdraw is the term given to a Saturday Lotto draw with a much larger guaranteed jackpot pool than usual. Members of the Australian Lotto Bloc use part of their revenue from normal weekly draws to fund these special draws, which occur seven times a year. In the days of the "Second Draw", Superdraw pools – like regular first division pools – were split evenly between the two draws (usually $8 million each at the time), however now all the funds are pooled into the one draw, resulting in a higher headline figure.  In recent years Superdraws have seen guaranteed First Division prize pools of around $20 million. Since 1999, the last Superdraw of each year is often known as a "Megadraw" – its guaranteed First Division pool is larger still, with the 2006 Megadraw's First Division pool amassing $33 million. [34] The end-of-year Megadraw – which began as a "Millennium Megadraw" on 31 December 1999 – is conducted on or around New Year's Eve; First Division pools in these draws are generally $30 million or more.  Since the expansion of New South Wales' Monday and Wednesday Lotto interstate, Superdraws have also appeared on Monday Lotto, where a First Division pool of $5 million is offered. As a single-state game NSW Lotteries ran more occasional promotions, such as "Anniversary Weeks" based around the anniversary of NSW Lotto's beginnings in November 1979.  Prize Home Lottery [ edit ]  A Prize Home Lottery is a lottery run by charitable organizations, such as the Returned and Services League of Australia , Surf Life Saving Australia , Mater Health Services , RSPCA Australia and Royal Melbourne Hospital . The main attraction of these lotteries are the prize homes, [35] often a brand new designer home. These lotteries are often valued at over a 1 million dollars, making winners instant millionaires. Along with a new house, first prize often includes a new car, brand new white and brown goods.  The funds raised from these lotteries are used to support disadvantaged men, woman, children and their families. Organizations such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Heart Foundation use the funds raised to research solutions for modern illnesses.

The numbers they chose were 5, 12, 34, 33, 42, with supplementary numbers 30 and 32. That&apos;s right —   32, 33, 34 , all in the one draw. How did that pattern fit with your usual plan of choosing family birthdays and your house number? Perhaps the lucky numbers from Saturday, December 19, 2009, might have suited you better — they included 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 23 and supplementaries 26 and 41. It&apos;s hard to imagine marking that many close together, and yet there were 27 winners to share the $4 million division-one prize that Saturday night. Get the latest Australian Lotto results The truth is, everyone has a different method for choosing lucky lotto numbers. There is only one certainty: that your chances of winning are about one in 2 million with a basic four-game pick. Mind you, they&apos;re not bad odds when you consider that with Oz Lotto you&apos;re looking at a one in 11 million chance and with Powerball it&apos;s one in 14 million. "That&apos;s what you call lucky," says Professor John Croucher of the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, an expert in statistics and author of Number Crunch  (Pan Australia, 2006) and The Secret Language  (ABC Books). "It&apos;s what we call a &apos;statistical variation&apos; — a boring term for what everyone else calls &apos;luck&apos;. There&apos;s a random element in all gambling and it&apos;s not possible to predict who will win." The Gary Ablett factor So what is the best way to choose numbers? Some people like to choose numbers that come up all the time. Others go with those that are not so frequent. Visit the NSW Lotteries website and you&apos;ll find a "Number Selector" tool that allows you to track both with the push of one button. In case you were wondering, John Vineburg from NSW Lotteries offers the following information about Oz Lotto&apos;s luckiest and unluckiest numbers: Lucky: 3, 35, 13, 17, 33, 26 and 25. Unlucky: 36, 42, 38, 30, 24, 14 and 10. Be aware, though, that statistically it makes no difference as to whether your lucky seven comes out every week or once in a blue moon. "I know that people have theories that some numbers are luckier than others because they come up more frequently, while others say that infrequent numbers are overdue," Croucher says. "Realistically, it doesn&apos;t matter. Lotto numbers have no memory. There&apos;s no emotion involved and no memory." In Geelong, they might disagree. According to the Geelong Advertiser , AFL footballer Gary Ablett Jr is proving lucky for many local residents. Ablett, who picked up a premiership and the Brownlow Medal with the Geelong Cats in 2009, plays in guernsey 29 — a number which appeared for three Geelong division one Tattslotto winners in 2009. The secret to winning Of course, it may not be which numbers you choose, but where you choose them that makes the difference. Greystanes in NSW topped the list of Australia&apos;s top 20 lotto-winning suburbs for 2009, now being home to $9.4 million in new Lotto winnings. But that amount was shared between only two winners. If you&apos;re looking for the spot that struck it lucky the most often, you&apos;d need to travel to Perth in WA or Campbelltown in NSW, with four winners each. So you have to ask, are they winning more often because they&apos;re buying more tickets in these places? "That&apos;s not necessarily true," Croucher says. "You could buy one and I could buy 50 and you could still win. Of course, it does increase your chances if you buy more tickets, but it doesn&apos;t guarantee a win. Basically, the luckiest suburbs are random, and it all comes back to that statistical variation." Which means that hightailing it to Greystanes to buy your next ticket won&apos;t necessarily improve your chances of a big win. Whether you use a dartboard, astrology, numerology, special dates, or whim to choose your numbers, play the same numbers religiously for years or change them each week depending on the weather conditions, there&apos;s only one way to improve your chances of winning: buy a ticket. "If you don&apos;t buy a ticket, the chances of winning are easy to calculate," Croucher says, who admits to going the autopick option to choose his numbers. "That is, there&apos;s no chance of winning at all."

How to play a syndicate with Oz Lotteries    Increase your odds with a Syndicate  Syndicates let you share the cost of a lotto ticket with other players so that you can play a lot more games for less money. Playing more games increases your chance of winning. And if the syndicate wins, the prizes are shared equally among the syndicate players. Learn more about syndicate shares.  More chances to win for less  On average, most of our syndicates offer over 500 chances to win a jackpot for less than $50. This works out to be 20 times cheaper, on average, than it would to buy the same amount of tickets on your own. Our syndicates are made up of small groups of 10-20 people. This size of group provides a good balance between increasing your chances of winning and lower prize shares.  We look after everything  Oz Lotteries manages each syndicate so that you don’t have to worry. Each player pays for their share and once all shares of a syndicate are filled, Oz Lotteries purchases the tickets. You’ll then receive an email to let you know what numbers your syndicate is playing for the coming draws.  After each draw, we send you a results email that lets you know if your syndicate has won a prize. If you have won, Oz Lotteries divides the prize equally between all shares and deposits the funds into your account. You can then either withdraw your winnings or use these funds to purchase additional tickets on Oz Lotteries.  [Source: https://www.ozlotteries.com/blog/increase-your-chances-of-winning-the-lotto/]    The Odds of Winning Lotto How to Win Lotto  Lotto draws are games of chance in which you choose any 5, 6 or 7 numbers from 36 to 65 numbers, which is the case in the most popular world lotteries.  How to Win Lotto  Therefore, in the case of a lottery playing 45 numbers, such as Monday, Wednesday and Saturday Lotto in Australia, there are 8,145,060 unique combinations of six numbers which can be selected from 45 numbers. This means that you have a 1 in 8.145 million chance of correctly picking the 6 winning numbers from 45 numbers.  That’s why winning a Division One prize in any lotto is so difficult.  In other words, you would have to play all 8.145 million unique six-number combinations of the numbers 1 to 45 to be guaranteed of winning the major ‘pick-6’ Division 1 prize. By comparison, a lottery which only plays a pool of 40 numbers produces relatively more favourable odds with a 1 in 3.838 million chance of correctly picking the six winning numbers.  The National UK Lottery plays 6 from 49 numbers, in which case, the odds are an incredible 1 in almost 14 million!  The biggest jackpot lottery in the United States is Powerball USA, which picks 5 numbers from 69 plus 1 Powerball number from 1 to 26, has odds in excess of 175 million to one. Any wonder it’s biggest ever jackpot grew to a record USD$1.4 Billion in January, 2016, as no one could win it.  In Europe it is the Euromillions lottery where the odds of winning a prize are just 1 in 13. Most people, however, are more interested what the odds of winning the Euromillions jackpot are. The odds of matching all five balls and the 2 Lucky Stars to win the Jackpot is 1 in 116,531,800.  Having said all that, it still remains fact that every single lottery game you play is capable of winning a prize, including the jackpot. You can also look at it another way… every lotto game you play has 50% chance of winning. You either win or you don’t!    Lowering The Odds How to Win Lotto  Thankfully, the chances, or odds, of winning a lower division prize, by trapping only three, four or five of the winning numbers in one game, are significantly better.  Look at the table below, and reflect on the average number of winning games as documented each week by some of the world’s biggest lotteries.    how to win lotto    Here is the proof that winning the major jackpot prize is extremely rare. But, the important information here is the total amount of smaller prizes that are won.  Therefore, approximately 99.99% of all the prizes won in any major lottery in the world are earned by matching only three, four or five of the winning numbers.  Coupled with the fact that only 1 in 200 games played each week will win a prize – any prize – then these two facts require a shift in your thinking if you want to win at lotto.    What is a Systems Entry? How to Win Lotto  A system allows you to play more numbers than for a standard entry, providing you with an entry covering every combination of 6 numbers from the numbers you have chosen. This type of entry allows players to increase their chances of winning a prize by playing a wider range of number combinations.  Simply put, a system allows you to pick more than just the allowed 6 numbers for each lotto game. For instance, a “System 7” allows you to pick 7 numbers, while a “System 8” allows you to pick 8 numbers, and so on. The highest amount of numbers you can pick is 20 which is a “System 20”.  In a System, your entry is equivalent to playing every possible 6-number combination from your selected numbers. For instance, if you played a System 8 (which has 28 possible combinations), your entry is equivalent to playing all 28 possible combinations of 6 numbers from your 8 selections.  So here is a breakdown of how the System Entries can significantly lower the odds and increase your chance of winning quite substantially.    Monday, Wednesday and Saturday Australian Lotto – 8,145,060 : 1 odds to win a Division One prize by picking 6 numbers.  Formula:  (45 / 6)  x  (44 / 5)  x  (43 / 4)  x  (42 / 3)  x  (41 / 2)  x  (40 / 1) = 8,145,060    Monday, Wednesday and Saturday Australian Lotto – 96,920 : 1 odds to win a Division One prize by picking System 9 Entry numbers (picking 9 numbers from 1 to 45).  Formula:  (45 / 9)  x  (44 / 8)  x  (43 / 7)  x  (42 / 6)  x  (41 / 5)  x  (40 / 4) = 96,920    If you work it out the odds for a System 18 entry, they will be very low.  Monday, Wednesday and Saturday Australian Lotto – 439 : 1 odds to win a Division One prize by picking System 18 Entry numbers (picking 18 numbers from 1 to 45).  Formula:  (45 / 18)  x  (44 / 17)  x  (43 / 16)  x  (42 / 15)  x  (41 / 14)  x  (40 / 13) = 439.    Therefore, quite simply, playing Systems entries can easily lower the odds and increase the chances of winning a major prize significantly. A System 18 entry, choosing 18 numbers between 1 and 45, will give you a One in 439 chance of winning Division One and potentially becoming a millionaire.  Of course, these System Entries cost a lot more than single pick 6 number entries so it depends on how much money you are keen to outlay to reduce the odds and increase your chances of winning big. Win Lotto Australia plays 5 x System 9 Entries as our Standard System Entry Strategy during Jackpots and Megadraws which costs us AUD$378.00. This strategy will cover all the numbers from 1 to 45, will play 420 games and reduce the odds of winning a Division One prize to One in 19,393 .

What are your chances of winning Oz Lotto?                    By the end of today, Australians are set to gamble up to $500 million, but most are not aware of just how low their chances really are, says a leading probability expert.        Updated  Updated 26 August 2013          Professor Peter Taylor is an applied mathematician at the University of Melbourne and says the average punter should be made aware of the reality of their choices, especially when it comes to OZ Lotto's $100 million jackpot today.  “You've got to choose seven numbers out of 45. There are, roughly speaking, 45 million ways of doing that; 45,360,620 I think is the exact number,” he said.  That's double Australia's population.  “And if you bought more than one ticket, multiply that by two – that's still not much out of 45 million,” he said.  Based on 18 games, the odds remain 2,521,090 to one.  Professor Taylor says most people are not aware, despite the obvious logic, that the system is designed to provide dividends to the operator.  “Every time you buy a lottery ticket you are losing. The lottery on average makes more money out of each ticket than you do, they pay less back than the full price,”   Dr Darren Christensen is among Australia's leading experts in behavioural decision making, especially in problem gambling.  “The reason people gamble is that they are thinking about what they might do with the money and are distracted by the possibility of winning,” he said.  “They don't make an accurate assessment of what the chances really are."  He has studied gambling behaviors around the world and says Australia's relationship with gambling is unique.  "It's usual to have a day where the prohibitions about gambling are lowered –  'the race that stops a nation' is quite unusual.  “For the most part – gambling is recreation that most people don't have a problem with. It's a small group that do, but they have a significant problem."  But even an applied mathematician like Professor Taylor is not immune to the fever that grips Australia on Melbourne Cup day.  “There are reasons to get involved: you feel part of something, you get a thrill, there's the hope that's engendered by the chance of winning and they are all positive things.  "But on average you are going to lose.  "You're not on a winner. It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, but you should not do it if you are trying to make money.  “For me gambling is not a bad thing, but you should ever gamble anything you can afford to lose."  Will he, an applied mathematician, be placing a bet on the Cup today or buying an OZ Lotto ticket?  “Ah, no,” he said.

It’s winning TattsLotto. Ever since I was a kid, one question has popped up around the kitchen table, at the pub, over coffee, and even in bed: what would you do if you won TattsLotto?  Recently the dream took a bizarre twist as we followed the story of a seemingly average bloke in Victoria who collected money from his mates for years to run a syndicate , buying dream-rich lottery tickets.  Last year, he apparently quit work quite suddenly, bought a big house and a fast car and began a life of luxury. About the same time, an anonymous winner from Victoria had apparently collected A$16 million in the very same lottery the syndicate had been investing their hard earned money and dreams.  His mates became suspicious. He initially claimed his windfall was an inheritance. They went to court. They’ve now reached some sort of confidential deal , but discussions continue. Life goes on.  The lottery industry  The Tatts Group runs eight lotteries, including TattsLotto, Oz Lotto and Powerball. It’s the oldest continuous private lottery operator in the world. It began in 1881 when a Sydney publican ran a sweep on the Sydney Cup. His name was George Adams. A horse called Progress won that year, but the real winner was George. He went on to found what we now call the Tatts Group .  Each year, Australians gamble about A$20 billion. Pokies account for around A$12 billion, lotteries account for about A$2 billion. Getting exact figures is hard – but of that A$2 billion from lotteries, A$1.2 billion is returned in prize money. The other A$800 million is split between running costs, the Tatts Group and state governments.  That Australians like to gamble is obvious. But it’s mostly on the pokies, the races and, more recently, sports. Some run into trouble – problem gambling affects about half a million Australians . Although buying lottery tickets can occasionally stray into the problem gambling arena, it is rare.  The odds of winning the top prize in TattsLotto with one game are about one in eight million. The odds in Powerball are about one in 77 million. So if you bought one standard 12-game “quickpick” per week, you should win TattsLotto once every 13 thousand years, and Powerball once every 123 thousand years! Of course there are lesser prizes as well, and as they say – you’ve got to be in it to win it! But how many winners do you know?      Flickr/Robert S. Donovan    These odds are so stacked against us, it’s hard to accept we keep believing. But believe we do – every week. If you do win the top prize, you’re fixed for life. Wealth, travel, comfort, privileges… a worry-free existence. Apparently. It’s not the money we dream about, it’s the lifestyle. Winning TattsLotto represents life on easy street.  Does the dream match reality?  Occasionally, there are reports that winning the lottery will herald bad outcomes.  Fortunately, this is the exception not the rule. Not surprisingly, most people who win a lottery or have any big financial windfall have better overall mental health afterwards – meaning less episodes of depression and anxiety. When you ask people about their level of happiness, they report a short period of euphoria after the win, but over time their happiness returns to their pre-wealth level !  As for the dream of leaving your job and living on a beautiful island surrounded by staff… No. Most people stay in the same area and many continue to work in the same job. They just spend more. Similarly, for their general health, there is no big effect one way or the other. This is interesting: mostly wealth is associated with better health. Research suggests the benefits of a lottery win are offset by increased drinking and smoking.  So why do we buy lottery tickets?  Clearly the maths of entering any of the Tatts games doesn’t add up. If you genuinely believed you could make money through gambling, wouldn’t you choose games that didn’t keep 40% of the prize pool? Or buy shares in the companies that run the lotteries?  The only consistent winners of these games are the so-called Tattersalls heirs . After George Adams died childless in 1904, he left the company to a range of employees and a few politicians. Throughout the century, the shares passed through various wills and when the company went public in 2005, about 2,500 Tattersalls heirs reaped the rewards.  I don’t think we can blame the huge success of lotteries on a gambling instinct – gambling relies on intermittent unpredictable wins – and lottery wins are just too infrequent to fuel this human instinct. Gambling is just a small driver of lotteries.  So what’s it all about? To be honest, like most human behaviours, nobody really knows. My money is on the hope idea. Buying a TattsLotto ticket buys you a little bit of hope. A dream. You get to imagine life unencumbered by financial constraints.     holiday.  Flickr/saguarosally    You buy the opportunity to sit around and ponder what you’d do if you won. Here’s my list: a long holiday, a new car, a holiday house, a really big and fancy drum kit and reduce work to two days per week. I’d stay anonymous and I’d hire a lawyer, an accountant and a financial adviser. I’d also take care of karma and give some to charity and family!  Lottery tickets let you to do some planning – you ask yourself “What will make me happy?” It lets you compare notes with your friends “You’d quit? Not me, I’d buy the company and sack our idiot manager. Ha ha!” It gives you $8.55 worth of hope. A small price to pay.  As for the Geelong man at the centre of the current controversy – I suspect he’s learning that there’s a fine line between a dream and a nightmare. On the other hand, I’m also reminded of flamboyant pianist Liberace’s catch phrase: “I cried all the way to the bank.”        Previous post  May 15, 2015 Injecting regulations into cosmetic medicine       Next post  February 24, 2016 When it comes to mental health, like attracts like           Tweet     Share      Get newsletter  Newsletter               Most popular on The Conversation   Rights of the dead and the living clash when scientists extract DNA from human remains  Why the Christian right opposes pornography but still supports Trump  How Cambridge Analytica’s Facebook targeting model really worked – according to the person who built it  Why prime numbers still fascinate mathematicians, 2,300 years later  Why you stink at fact-checking    I’m suing Scott Pruitt’s broken EPA - here’s how to fix it  How kindness can make a difference in cancer care  What might explain the unhappiness epidemic?
