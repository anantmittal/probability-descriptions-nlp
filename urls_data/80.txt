Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.

Diagnosing PCO with ultrasound - What does a polycystic ovary look like?  In a polycystic ovary, the numerous small cystic structures, also called antral follicles , give the ovaries a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound.

PCOS Glossary Reference sources  PCOS Pregnancy and Delivery Complications Women with PCOS are at higher risk for pregnancy and delivery complications. These include a three-fold increase in miscarriage risk in early pregnancy compared to women without PCOS, gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) which can lead to large babies, preeclampsia which is characterized by sudden elevated blood pressure and body swelling after the 20th week of pregnancy, preterm birth, and C-section delivery. Diabetes during pregnancy is a concern many women with PCOS must face. The following information is published with permission from the Hormone Health Network , the public education arm of the Endocrine Society. It has been extracted from the Diabetes and Pregnancy patient guide. What care do you need during pregnancy? Blood glucose. While pregnant, you will probably need to check your blood sugar more often than before pregnancy. Check your blood sugar as often as your doctor recommends. You should probably test it before meals, one or two hours after a meal, at bedtime, and during the night. Ask your doctor what your blood glucose numbers should be. Most pregnant women with diabetes should aim for these blood sugar levels as long as they do not cause low blood sugar: Before meals (fasting blood glucose) One hour after the start of a meal: 140 mg/dL or less Two hours after the start of a meal: 120 mg/dL or less Insulin. If you were already using an insulin pump before pregnancy, you should keep using it. You probably should not start using an insulin pump for the first time during pregnancy. But if other types of insulin treatment do not control your blood sugar, your doctor may want you to switch to an insulin pump. Medical nutrition therapy. You should see a dietitian for nutrition therapy. This healthy eating plan, tailored to you, helps make sure you get the nutrients you need and gain the right amount of weight, while controlling your blood sugar. The dietitian may suggest you limit the amount of carbohydrates, or “carbs” (for instance, potatoes, bread, and fruit), that you eat. It is a good idea to eat three small meals and two to four snacks a day. Your dietitian also will advise how often to eat and how many calories to eat a day. Vitamins. Your doctor likely will decrease the dose of folic acid you take once you finish your first trimester of pregnancy (week 12). Most often, the recommended dose of folic acid is 0.4 mg (400 micrograms) to 1 mg per day through the rest of pregnancy and until you stop breastfeeding. Ask your doctor what other prenatal vitamins you need. Will you be able to breastfeed? Women with diabetes are encouraged to breastfeed their baby. Breastfeeding lowers your baby’s risk for childhood obesity and for type 2 diabetes later in life. Women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes; breastfeeding seems to lower that risk. It also may help you lose the weight you gained during pregnancy! Insulin is safe for breastfeeding women. If you take metformin or glyburide pills to treat type 2 diabetes, you can safely continue taking these medications while breastfeeding. What can you do to help have a healthy baby? You can help ensure your baby’s health and your own health. Work with your obstetrician and your diabetes specialist to get proper medical care before, during, and after pregnancy. Take your diabetes medicine as prescribed and keep your blood sugar in control. Follow the healthy eating plan that you made with your health care team. Also, be physically active. Ask your doctor what type of activity is best for you. The good news is that with careful planning, proper medical care, and good self-care, you can have a safe pregnancy and a healthy baby.

Women with PCOS have a hormonal imbalance and metabolism problems that may affect their overall health and appearance. PCOS is also a common and treatable cause of infertility.          Expand all  |  Collapse all      What is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?   Polycystic  (pah-lee-SIS-tik) ovary syndrome (PCOS), also known as polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common health problem caused by an imbalance of reproductive hormones . The hormonal imbalance creates problems in the ovaries . The ovaries make the egg that is released each month as part of a healthy menstrual cycle. With PCOS, the egg may not develop as it should or it may not be released during ovulation as it should be.  PCOS can cause missed or irregular menstrual periods. Irregular periods can lead to:   Infertility (inability to get pregnant). In fact, PCOS is one of the most common causes of female infertility.  Development of cysts (small fluid-filled sacs) in the ovaries      Who gets PCOS?   Between 5% and 10% of women of childbearing age (between 15 and 44) have PCOS. 1 Most often, women find out they have PCOS in their 20s and 30s, when they have problems getting pregnant and see their doctor. But PCOS can happen at any age after puberty. 2  Women of all races and ethnicities are at risk for PCOS, but your risk for PCOS may be higher if you are obese or if you have a mother, sister, or aunt with PCOS.     What are the symptoms of PCOS?   Some of the symptoms of PCOS include:   Irregular menstrual cycle . Women with PCOS may miss periods or have fewer periods (fewer than eight in a year). Or, their periods may come every 21 days or more often. Some women with PCOS stop having menstrual periods.  Too much hair on the face, chin, or parts of the body where men usually have hair. This is called "hirsutism." Hirsutism affects up to 70% of women with PCOS. 3  Acne on the face, chest, and upper back  Thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp; male-pattern baldness  Weight gain or difficulty losing weight  Darkening of skin , particularly along neck creases, in the groin, and underneath breasts  Skin tags , which are small excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area      What causes PCOS?   The exact cause of PCOS is not known. Most experts think that several factors, including genetics, play a role:   High levels of androgens (AN-druh-junz) . Androgens are sometimes called "male hormones," although all women make small amounts of androgens. Androgens control the development of male traits, such as male-pattern baldness. Women with PCOS have more androgens than normal. Estrogens are also called "female hormones." Higher than normal androgen levels in women can prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation) during each menstrual cycle, and can cause extra hair growth and acne, two signs of PCOS.  High levels of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls how the food you eat is changed into energy. Insulin resistance is when the body's cells do not respond normally to insulin. As a result, your insulin blood levels become higher than normal. Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance, especially those who are overweight or obese, have unhealthy eating habits, do not get enough physical activity, and have a family history of diabetes (usually type 2 diabetes). Over time, insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes.      Can I still get pregnant if I have PCOS?   Yes. Having PCOS does not mean you can't get pregnant. PCOS is one of the most common, but treatable, causes of infertility in women. In women with PCOS, the hormonal imbalance interferes with the growth and release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation). If you don't ovulate, you can't get pregnant.  Your doctor can talk with you about ways to help you ovulate and to raise your chance of getting pregnant .     Does PCOS raise my risk for other health problems?   Yes, studies have found links between PCOS and other health problems, including:   Diabetes. More than half of women with PCOS will have diabetes or pre-diabetes (glucose intolerance) before the age of 40. 4 Learn more about diabetes on our Diabetes page .  High blood pressure. Women with PCOS are at greater risk of having high blood pressure compared with women of the same age without PCOS. High blood pressure is a leading cause of heart disease and stroke. Learn more about heart disease and stroke.  Unhealthy cholesterol. Women with PCOS often have higher levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. High cholesterol raises your risk for heart disease and stroke.  Sleep apnea. This is when momentary and repeated stops in breathing interrupt sleep. Many women with PCOS are overweight or obese, which can cause sleep apnea. Sleep apnea raises your risk for heart disease and diabetes.  Depression and anxiety.  Depression and anxiety are common among women with PCOS.  Endometrial cancer. Problems with ovulation, obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes (all common in women with PCOS) increase the risk of developing cancer of the endometrium (lining of the uterus or womb).      Will my PCOS symptoms go away at menopause?   Yes and no. PCOS affects many systems in the body. Many women with PCOS find that their menstrual cycles become more regular as they get closer to menopause . However, their PCOS hormonal imbalance does not change with age, so they may continue to have symptoms of PCOS.  Also, the risks of PCOS-related health problems, such as diabetes, stroke, and heart attack, increase with age. These risks may be higher in women with PCOS than those without.     How is PCOS diagnosed?   There is no single test to diagnose PCOS. To help diagnose PCOS and rule out other causes of your symptoms, your doctor may talk to you about your medical history and do a physical exam and different tests:   Physical exam. Your doctor will measure your blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) , and waist size. He or she will also look at your skin for extra hair on your face, chest or back, acne, or skin discoloration. Your doctor may look for any hair loss or signs of other health conditions (such as an enlarged thyroid gland).  Pelvic exam. Your doctor may do a pelvic exam for signs of extra male hormones (for example, an enlarged clitoris) and check to see if your ovaries are enlarged or swollen.  Pelvic ultrasound (sonogram). This test uses soundwaves to examine your ovaries for cysts and check the endometrium (lining of the uterus or womb).  Blood tests. Blood tests check your androgen hormone levels, sometimes called "male hormones." Your doctor will also check for other hormones related to other common health problems that can be mistaken for PCOS, such as thyroid disease . Your doctor may also test your cholesterol levels and test you for diabetes.   Once other conditions are ruled out, you may be diagnosed with PCOS if you have at least two of the following symptoms: 5   Irregular periods, including periods that come too often, not often enough, or not at all  Signs that you have high levels of androgens:  Extra hair growth on your face, chin, and body (hirsutism)  Acne  Thinning of scalp hair    Higher than normal blood levels of androgens  Multiple cysts on one or both ovaries      How is PCOS treated?   There is no cure for PCOS, but you can manage the symptoms of PCOS. You and your doctor will work on a treatment plan based on your symptoms, your plans for children, and your risk for long-term health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Many women will need a combination of treatments, including:   Steps you can take at home to help relieve your symptoms  Medicines      What steps can I take at home to improve my PCOS symptoms?   You can take steps at home to help your PCOS symptoms, including:   Losing weight. Healthy eating habits and regular physical activity can help relieve PCOS-related symptoms. Losing weight may help to lower your blood glucose levels, improve the way your body uses insulin, and help your hormones reach normal levels. Even a 10% loss in body weight (for example, a 150-pound woman losing 15 pounds) can help make your menstrual cycle more regular and improve your chances of getting pregnant. 3 Learn more about fitness and nutrition .  Removing hair. You can try facial hair removal creams, laser hair removal, or electrolysis to remove excess hair. You can find hair removal creams and products at drugstores. Procedures like laser hair removal or electrolysis must be done by a doctor and may not be covered by health insurance.  Slowing hair growth. A prescription skin treatment (eflornithine HCl cream) can help slow down the growth rate of new hair in unwanted places.      What types of medicines treat PCOS?   The types of medicines that treat PCOS and its symptoms include:   Hormonal birth control, including the pill, patch, shot, vaginal ring, and hormone intrauterine device (IUD). For women who don't want to get pregnant, hormonal birth control can:  Make your menstrual cycle more regular  Lower your risk of endometrial cancer  Help improve acne and reduce extra hair on the face and body (Ask your doctor about birth control with both estrogen and progesterone.)    Anti-androgen medicines. These medicines block the effect of androgens and can help reduce scalp hair loss, facial and body hair growth, and acne. They are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PCOS symptoms. These medicines can also cause problems during pregnancy.  Metformin. Metformin is often used to treat type 2 diabetes and may help some women with PCOS symptoms. It is not approved by the FDA to treat PCOS symptoms. Metformin improves insulin's ability to lower your blood sugar and can lower both insulin and androgen levels. After a few months of use, metformin may help restart ovulation, but it usually has little effect on acne and extra hair on the face or body. Recent research shows that metformin may have other positive effects, including lowering body mass and improving cholesterol levels.      What are my treatment options for PCOS if I want to get pregnant?   You have several options to help your chances of getting pregnant if you have PCOS:   Losing weight. If you are overweight or obese, losing weight through healthy eating, including eating the right amount of calories for you , and regular physical activity can help make your menstrual cycle more regular and improve your fertility.  Medicine. After ruling out other causes of infertility in you and your partner, your doctor might prescribe medicine to help you ovulate, such as clomiphene (Clomid).  In vitro fertilization (IVF). IVF may be an option if medicine does not work. In IVF, your egg is fertilized with your partner's sperm in a laboratory and then placed in your uterus to implant and develop. Compared to medicine alone, IVF has higher pregnancy rates and better control over your risk for twins and triplets (by allowing your doctor to transfer a single fertilized egg into your uterus).  Surgery. Surgery is also an option, usually only if the other options do not work. The outer shell (called the cortex ) of ovaries is thickened in women with PCOS and thought to play a role in preventing spontaneous ovulation. Ovarian drilling is a surgery in which the doctor makes a few holes in the surface of your ovary using lasers or a fine needle heated with electricity. Surgery usually restores ovulation, but only for six to eight months.   Read more about treating infertility in PCOS .     How does PCOS affect pregnancy?

Newsletter What You Should Know About Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and Pregnancy Medically reviewed by Suzanne Falck, MD, FACP on  November 2, 2016 — Written by Chaunie Brusie, RN, BSN Risks for moms Risks for baby Conceiving Breast-feeding Definition Symptoms Treatment Next steps    Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects between 6 and 15 percent of women of childbearing age. If you’re diagnosed with PCOS, it may be more difficult to become pregnant. And if you’re able to become pregnant, you’re at risk for more complications during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.  Women with PCOS are three times more likely to have a miscarriage, as compared to women who don’t have PCOS. They are also more likely to develop preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and have a larger baby and premature delivery. This could lead to difficulty during delivery or a cesarean delivery.  Risks for moms Risks for
moms-to-be with PCOS  Having PCOS might make it harder for you to get pregnant. Hormonal imbalances might be to blame.  Women with PCOS are more likely to be obese and to rely on reproductive technology to get pregnant. One study found that 60 percent of women with PCOS are obese. Almost 14 percent required reproductive technology to get pregnant.  Women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing several medical complications throughout life, including:  insulin resistance type 2 diabetes high cholesterol high blood pressure heart disease stroke sleep apnea possibly an increased risk of endometrial cancer  For pregnant women, PCOS brings an increased risk of complications. This includes preeclampsia, a dangerous condition for both mother and baby-to-be. There is no treatment for preeclampsia. If you develop it during your pregnancy, you will have to be monitored extremely closely. Other concerns include pregnancy-induced hypertension (high blood pressure) and gestational diabetes.  Having gestational diabetes could lead to you having a larger-than-average baby. This could lead to problems during delivery. For example, larger babies are more at risk for shoulder dystocia (when the baby's shoulder gets stuck during labor).  Most PCOS symptoms during pregnancy can be treated with careful monitoring. If you develop gestational diabetes, insulin may be required to keep your blood sugar levels stable.  Risks for baby Risks for baby  Unfortunately, having PCOS during pregnancy makes things a little more complicated. It will require more monitoring for both you and your baby.  The potential risks with PCOS for the baby include:  premature birth large for gestational age increased risk of meconium aspiration miscarriage lower Apgar score  If your baby is a girl, some studies have shown that there is up to a 50 percent chance that she will also have PCOS.  Women with PCOS are also more likely to deliver by cesarean because they tend to have larger-sized babies. Other complications may also come up during labor and delivery.  Conceiving Getting pregnant with PCOS  Some women may not realize they have PCOS until they try to conceive. PCOS often goes unnoticed. But if you’ve been trying to conceive naturally for over a year, you should speak to your doctor about getting tested.  Your doctor can help you develop a plan for getting pregnant. Some strategies, such as losing weight, healthy eating, and in certain cases, medications, can increase your chances for getting pregnant.  Breast-feeding PCOS and breast-feeding  If you’re diagnosed with PCOS, you may need to continue to manage symptoms even after pregnancy. But symptoms and severity can vary. Sometimes the hormonal fluctuations after pregnancy and breast-feeding can change the symptoms, so it may be awhile before you settle into your new "normal."  It’s safe to breast-feed with PCOS, even if you’re on insulin medication to help control your blood sugar. Women who have gestational diabetes are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life, but breast-feeding can help lower that risk .  Breast-feeding has many benefits for both you and your baby, so if it fits your family, be sure to explore the options and available resources so you can have a successful breast-feeding experience.  Definition What is PCOS?  PCOS, also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a hormonal imbalance that affects women. It’s characterized by the production of too many androgens, or "male" hormones.  PCOS can cause women to develop excessive hair and acne. It can also cause cysts on the ovaries and interrupt normal menstrual cycles.  It's a tricky condition because there’s not one single test to diagnose it. Instead, doctors look at the clues of what's going on in your body. Excessive hair growth or irregular periods might be signs. Doctors can then piece together a picture of PCOS.  Symptoms PCOS symptoms  PCOS often gets missed in women because of the difficulty of making a diagnosis. The symptoms can vary and occur in many different types of women.  Obesity or weight gain, for example, can be a frequent occurrence with PCOS. But it's not a given. Many women with PCOS have lean body shapes.  Unfortunately, up to 50 percent of women who have PCOS never actually get diagnosed. Because of this, PCOS is sometimes called the silent killer.  Some of the more common symptoms of PCOS include:  "string of pearl" cysts on the ovaries insulin resistance high testosterone causing excessive hair growth, male pattern baldness, and acne suppressed ovulation excessive weight gain weight gain on the waistline dark, thick patches of skin on the neck, arms, breasts, or thighs skin tags in the armpits or neck area pelvic pain anxiety or depression sleep apnea  Treatment Treatment  There’s currently no treatment for PCOS. But it’s possible to manage symptoms.  Options to help manage symptoms include:  birth control pills weight loss spironolactone other androgen blockers  Along with other fertility drugs, metformin, which helps to control blood sugar, is commonly prescribed to help induce ovulation.  Note: You’ll need to stop taking some of these medications if you become pregnant. Work with your doctor to develop a plan that fits your needs.  Next steps Next steps  The most important thing to know about PCOS and pregnancy is that complications are very real. That’s why it’s more important than ever to take steps to have a healthy pregnancy.  Talk to your doctor, follow a pregnancy-safe exercise and diet program, and take medication as directed. These are all recommended regimens for controlling PCOS during pregnancy.

Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.

IVF clinics are not all the same - learn more about IVF pregnancy success rates .     Controlling Multiple Pregnancy Risks with PCOS   Using injectable gonadotropins to treat PCOS infertility has a high risk for high-order multiple pregnancy (triplets and higher). The level of risk is unacceptable for some couples  Recent advances in IVF technologies have resulted in the ability to maintain high pregnancy rates while controlling multiple pregnancy risk  Blastocyst embryo transfer is a variant of the standard IVF treatment that is useful in controlling multiple birth rates      Our IVF PCOS Success Rates and Statistics   In general, IVF success rates are excellent for cases with infertility caused by PCOS  In our in vitro fertilization program we see PCOS pregnancy statistics of about 60% for a live birth rate per egg retrieval (woman under age 35). This is dependent on several factors including whether one or two embryos are transferred to the uterus.  We have had many PCOS IVF success stories...  See our IVF live birth success rates      IVF Protocols for PCOS  We specialize in treating women with PCOS and have 2 IVF stimulation protocols that we commonly use with PCOS:    Ganirelix with Lupron trigger protocol - this is what we currently use in order to avoid ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome .  PCOS down-regulation protocol (below)   The down-regulation PCOS IVF protocol combines:   Metformin   Oral contraceptive pills  Lupron down-regulation ovarian stimulation protocol      The calendar below shows the down-regulation  protocol for PCOS   We use metformin, usually at a dose of 500mg 3 times daily for at least a month before starting Lupron  Then, oral contraceptive pills for about 21 days (last 4 days of OCP shown on calendar)  Lupron overlaps with the last 3 birth control pills  Ovarian stimulation starts after 6 or 7 "pill free" days  Careful control of the dose of injectable FSH hormone and cautious monitoring of the ovarian response is important with polycystic ovary cases  We do our very best to avoid over-responding, which can result in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome     Sunday  Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday    1  OCP  2  OCP/Lupron  3  OCP/Lupron  4  OCP/Lupron  5  Lupron  6  Lupron  7  Lupron    8  Lupron  9  Lupron  10  Lupron  11  Lupron  Start ovarian stimulation Day 1 of stim  12  Lupron Day 2 of stim  13  Lupron Day 3 of stim  14  Lupron Day 4 of stim    15  Lupron Day 5 of stim  16  Lupron Day 6 of stim  17  Lupron Day 7 of stim  18  Lupron Day 8 of stim  19  Lupron Day 9 of stim  20  Lupron  HCG injection Day 10 of stim  21    22  Egg retrieval  Day of fertilization  23  24  25  Day 3 transfer  26  27  Day 5 transfer  28      Key to table:   Lupron = subcutaneous injection of a medication called Lupron (GnRH agonist). This medication is taken once daily  HCG injection = injection of a medication called HCG, which causes the eggs to complete maturation. This is taken only once in the cycle.  Egg retrieval procedure = the procedure that gets eggs from the ovaries   Embryo transfer procedure = the procedure putting embryos back in the uterus   Most women need  4 to 6 visits for monitoring the stimulation (not shown on this calendar) before they get the HCG trigger shot  The duration of the ovarian stimulation process can be shorter or longer than shown. This example shows 10 days of stimulation   before the HCG trigger  The average number of days of stimulation is 9-10, with a range of 7 to 14 days   Related Articles   Lupron trigger IVF protocol to avoid hyperstimulation syndrome  Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)  PCOS Treatment Options  PCOS Clomid Fertility Treatment  Injectable FSH Hormone for PCOS Treatment  Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS Treatment  Metformin for PCOS  PCO Laparoscopy        Quick Links   Freeze some eggs to preserve your fertility  Our success rates  IVF cost  IVF money-back guarantees  Money back guarantee plans for frozen donor eggs  Day 5 blastocyst transfer  IVF steps - calendar  Infertility insurance issues / plans          CHICAGO        4920 N.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a common cause of female infertility. The ovaries in these women contain multiple small cystic structures, or antral follicles , that are 2-9 mm in diameter.   The ovaries have a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound     Ultrasound image of PCOS ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"   For a more detailed general explanation of PCOS, see: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, PCOS   Women with PCOS syndrome do not ovulate (release eggs) regularly and therefore have irregular menstrual cycles  Therefore, treatment for infertility caused by PCOS  is directed at getting the woman to ovulate  Doctors call this "induction of ovulation"      What is induction of ovulation?  Ovulation induction involves the use of medication to stimulate development of one or more mature follicles (where eggs develop) in the ovaries of women who have ovulation problems and infertility.     PCOS Fertility Treatment - Inducing Ovulation  Treatment Options  There are several possible ways to attempt ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovaries, including:   Clomid, clomiphene citrate  Metformin  Clomid and metformin together  Femara, letrozole  Injectable gonadotropins  IVF, In Vitro Fertilization      PCOS Pregnancy Statistics  Pregnancy success rates with induction of ovulation vary considerably and depend on:  The age of the woman  The type of PCOS meds used  Whether the medication used is effective at stimulating ovulation in that woman  Whether there are other infertility factors present in the couple   In general, successful treatment resulting in pregnancy is more likely to occur in the first 3 to 4 months of treatment. After that, the monthly success rate drops off considerably.  The approximate average monthly pregnancy success rate (female age under 35, normal sperm) for the major types of treatment used for PCOS are:    Treatment for PCOS  Expected "Monthly" Success Rate    Metformin alone  About 1-2%    Clomid  15% - if ovulating    Femara  15% - if ovulating    Injectable gonadotropins  20%    IVF, In vitro fertilization  60% - at our IVF clinic       A brief overview of each PCOS treatment option is below  For details see the pages that discuss each treatment option  Clomid   The least complicated method is the use of Clomid tablets, also called Serophene, or clomiphene citrate  Many will be able to get pregnant using clomiphene to induce ovulation  Clomiphene is usually the first line of treatment   Details about  Clomid for treatment of polycystic ovarian disease and infertility     Femara (Letrozole)  Femara (generic name is letrozole) is an oral drug which can be effective in stimulating ovulation in some women with polycystic ovaries and anovulation.  Some women that do not respond and ovulate with Clomid will respond well to letrozole. Other women that do ovulate with Clomid may never get pregnant on it, and could do better with letrozole.  Details about Femara (letrozole) for PCOS treatment       Injectable Gonadotropins (FSH Hormones)  For women that do not ovulate with clomiphene, the "traditional" next step has been to use injectable gonadotropins. The woman takes daily shots of FSH hormone for about 7 to 15 days in order to stimulate mature follicle development.  Risks and Side Effects   The injectable medications are expensive  Beware of multiple birth risks with this treatment option - there are risks for triplets and higher order multiple pregnancies  There are risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome  The daily injections and multiple trips to the office for monitoring are  inconvenient  Injectables for PCOS treatment     IVF - In Vitro Fertilization  The large majority of women with PCOS that have not gotten pregnant with other treatments will be able to have success with IVF if they are under 40 years of age and have their IVF performed at a high quality clinic.  IVF clinics are not all the same - learn more about IVF pregnancy success rates  Success Rates   In general, IVF success rates are excellent in cases with infertility caused by PCOS  In our in vitro fertilization program we see PCOS pregnancy statistics of about 60% for a live birth rate (woman under age 35)   Our IVF success rate statistics   We specialize in treating women with PCOS and have many IVF PCOS success stories   We usually use a PCOS IVF protocol combining metformin, oral contraceptive pills, and the Lupron down-regulation stimulation protocol  Recent advances in IVF technologies have resulted in the ability to maintain high success rates while controlling multiple pregnancy risks  Blastocyst embryo transfer is a variant of standard IVF treatment that is useful in controlling multiple birth risks   Details about IVF treatment for PCOS     Metformin  Oral medications such as metformin (brand name Glucophage) can be used to try to stimulate ovulation with PCOS. It can be used with or without Clomid.   Metformin is an "insulin sensitizing agent" primarily used to control diabetes.   Success Rates  Not many couples will get pregnant using metformin alone. However, some women will respond to metformin and clomiphene when they are used in combination.  Some will not ovulate even with the combination therapy and  will need  either injectable FSH medications, or IVF to have a baby.  Side Effects  Metformin has unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea in about 25% of patients.  Metformin for PCOS and fertility treatment     Cost for Induction of Ovulation and PCOS Treatments  The costs associated with induction of ovulation depend on:   The type and dose of medication required.  The number of ultrasound and blood tests  required to properly monitor the cycle.  Sometimes artificial insemination will  be recommended, which increases the chances for a pregnancy, as well as the cost.    A Clomid cycle usually costs between $100 and about $1200, depending on what is done.  A cycle with injectable gonadotropins usually costs between $1500 and $6000, depending on what is done and the doses of  injectables needed to stimulate follicles to grow.

These women  do not ovulate (release eggs) regularly and therefore have irregular menstrual periods.  The ovaries have many small cysts (2-7 mm diameter) called antral follicles , giving  the ovaries a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts)  appearance on ultrasound.  A relatively new method of treating ovulation problems in women with polycystic ovarian disease is to use an oral medication called metformin (brand name is Glucophage).  Metformin has traditionally been used as an oral drug to help control diabetes. Then, some smart doctor figured out that polycystic ovarian syndrome treatment with metformin can be very effective.  If Glucophage alone does not result in ovulation and pregnancy, we often use:    Clomid and metformin together to induce ovulation   If the combination therapy is not effective, we can try:    Letrozole for induction of ovulation   Or, move on to injectable FSH hormone   Or, in vitro fertilization, IVF for PCOS        Metformin Use with IVF Treatment  We also use Glucophage in women going through in vitro fertilization for PCOS , and for those with very high antral follicle counts -  if their   ovaries are "polycystic" by ultrasound.  We find that some women with polycystic ovaries respond with a "smoother" response to the injectable FSH medication if they have been taking Glucophage.     Risks and Side Effects of Metformin / Glucophage  In about 25% of women Glucophage causes side effects which may include abdominal discomfort, cramping, diarrhea and nausea. The side effects may be severe enough to make the woman stop the Glucophage medication. We are not aware of any serious complications resulting from Glucophage treatment.  Another oral medication used for diabetes called Troglitazone has been associated with liver failure and death in rare cases. This has been publicized on television shows, in newspapers, etc. These problems have not been associated with the use of metformin for polycystic ovarian syndrome.       Treatment Process for Taking Metformin  Laboratory (blood) tests that are sometimes done before starting metformin:  LH, FSH, estradiol, DHEAS, testosterone, 17-OHP, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), kidney function tests (BUN, creatinine) and liver function tests (AST, ALT, and LDH).  Some doctors will do fasting blood sugar and fasting insulin levels in order to calculate a fasting glucose to insulin ratio. This is a measure of insulin resistance, which is present in some women with polycystic ovarian disease.       When to Have Intercourse   Patients need to be counseled regarding possibility of ovulation occurring   and need for regular intercourse (about every 2-3 days) in order to maximize   chances for pregnancy   Women should keep menstrual calendars, recording days of menstrual bleeding and intercourse        Treat polycystic ovarian syndrome with Glucophage / Metformin Alone Metformin Dosing and Protocol  Metformin is taken in a dose that the woman can tolerate. Most people can tolerate 500 mg three times daily, if they build up to that dose gradually.   We start metformin at 500 mg once daily, increase to 500 mg twice a day after one week, then to 500 mg 3 times daily after another week.  If the 3 times daily dose cannot be tolerated due to side effects, we remain on the twice-daily dose.  The most effective dose of Glucophage for PCOS is generally 500mg 3 times daily.      Add Clomiphene to Metformin Treatment Regimen  If the metformin does not result in ovulation and regular periods, the next step is often adding clomiphene to the regimen.   Treatment with Clomid and Metformin Together for PCOS        Other Treatment Options  If the combination of metformin and clomiphene does not result in ovulation then we move on to other options. We usually proceed with one of the following treatments to achieve pregnancy:   Injectable FSH Hormone   for PCOS Treatment   IVF Treatment for PCOS   Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS   Treatment      Weight Loss and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Treatment and Chances for Pregnancy  Some women will have polycystic ovarian syndrome and irregular or absent menstrual periods regardless of their weight. Others develop polycystic ovarian syndrome when they gain too much weight. These women are likely to resume regular ovulation if they can get back down to the weight at which they were previously ovulating.  Although doctors do not consider weight loss a "treatment", it can restore fertility or facilitate infertility treatment by making the body more responsive to fertility medications.   Weight loss improves pregnancy success rates for women with PCOS   Decrease weight to increase the success rate  More about weight and body mass index affecting fertility          Related Articles:   Anovulation  Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, PCOS  PCOS Treatment Options  PCOS Clomid Fertility Treatment            Quick Links   Freeze some eggs to preserve your fertility  Our success rates  IVF cost  IVF money-back guarantees  Money back guarantee plans for frozen donor eggs  Day 5 blastocyst transfer  IVF steps - calendar  Infertility insurance issues / plans          CHICAGO        4920 N.

It is often given to try to induce ovulation in women that do not develop and release an egg (ovulate) on their own  Women who do not ovulate  (without drugs) are said to have a condition called anovulation  The most common cause of anovulation is polycystic ovarian syndrome,  PCOS  This page is about Clomid treatment for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or with irregular menstrual cycles  Clomid for women with regular periods is discussed elsewhere        Related Pages    Polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS     Clomid treatment - general    PCOS treatment options    Injectables for PCOS treatment    Intrauterine insemination    IUI success rates    Clomid and metformin for PCOS    Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS treatment    IVF treatment for PCOS    IVF success rates    IVF pricing plans / guarantees             Ultrasound picture of a polycystic ovary Many small, immature follicles (black circles) are seen  Normal ovary with a  mature follicle (at cursors) 18mm diameter follicle is about ready for ovulation          PCOS and Clomid Treatment - Ovulation and Pregnancy Success Rates   Can I conceive with PCOS?  The chance for pregnancy with fertility treatments for PCOS is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with treatment.   For women under age 35, the question is more about which PCOS treatment will work - and not so much about whether any treatment will work.   Ovulation Success Rates  Women with PCOS will often ovulate after taking Clomid. However, this is variable and some  will not respond to Clomid  at all.   About three fourths of women that are not ovulating  will ovulate on Clomid at some dosing level  Women under 35 with PCOS should have about a 15% chance for pregnancy per month with Clomid treatment (for about 3-4 months) - if they ovulate with Clomid (if sperm and fallopian tubes are normal).   Clomid for PCOS - Pregnancy Success Rates   Only about 50% of women that ovulate with Clomid get pregnant with it  For women with PCOS under age 35 in our in vitro fertilization program the success rate is about 70% for pregnancy with one IVF cycle, and about 60% for live birth (miscarriages account for the different rates).   See our IVF Success Rate Statistics        Clomiphene Citrate Use and PCOS    What is the process for taking Clomid?  Establishing "Day One" of the Menstrual Period   Day one is counted as the first day of menstrual bleeding  The period can be from a spontaneous menstrual period or from a period induced with a progestin medication such as Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate)   Inducing a Period  (if needed)   In order to induce a period, Provera is given for 5 to 10 days at a dose of 5 or 10mg daily  The period usually starts within 2-7 days after the last Provera pill is taken   Starting Clomid   Clomid is started early in the menstrual cycle and is taken for five days either from cycle days 3 through 7, or from day 5 through 9  Clomid is usually started at a dose of one tablet (50mg) daily - taken any time of day   Increasing Clomid Dosage (if needed)   If the patient does not ovulate on the starting dose, Provera is often given to induce a period - then a 100mg dose of Clomid is tried  If she does not ovulate on a 100 mg dose, then 150mg is sometimes tried      Clomid Dosing Recommendations   Clomid works best when the lowest dose that results in ovulation is used   If a woman ovulates on 50mg then increasing to 100mg is probably of no benefit - and may result in increased side effects   Many women will ovulate on 50 or 100mg, and some will require 150 mg in order to get an ovulatory response   Some pregnancies will occur on clomiphene doses above 100mg. However, increasing the Clomid dose to 200mg  results in very few additional pregnancies.      How long does it take to ovulate using Clomid?  For women that do not ovulate on their own, the average day that ovulation occurs is about 8 to 10 days after completing a 5 day course of Clomid.   That means that a woman taking Clomid on days 5-9 will often ovulate on about day 16-20 of the cycle  However, there is significant variation in how long it takes ovulate using Clomid. Some will ovulate much later - as late as two or three weeks after the last clomiphene tablet.        How long should I try Clomid before moving on to other treatment options?   There is no set number of cycles of Clomid that should be done before moving on to other fertility treatments. Several variables are involved in the decision about moving on to more aggressive therapy.  No Ovulation Results After increasing Clomid Dosage   If a woman is not ovulating on a low dose of Clomid, the dose should be increased  If not ovulating at 150 mg then other therapies should be attempted   Female age and Clomid treatment and when to be more aggressive   Relatively fewer cycles should be done with an older female partner  Clomid probably should not be used at all if the female age is 40 or older because of the significantly reduced fertility potential  Women 38 or older should probably start fertility treatment with a fertility specialist - rather than with their gynecologist  If the female is under 38 years old and the sperm is good then usually  3-6 months of Clomid cycles (with good ovulation) are often tried   Personal factors regarding Clomid treatment and when to be more aggressive   The patient's own sense of urgency  Other personal factors, including degree of severity of any Clomid side effects   Financial considerations       Clomid and Treatment Costs  Clomid is not expensive and costs between about $10 and $100 per cycle depending on the dose and whether a brand name or generic clomiphene citrate is used.   The average cost for the Clomid pills for a cycle is about $40  The average cost for generic clomiphene citrate is about $15  Approximate average costs in the US (and  our fees) for various fertility treatments          Quick Links   Freeze some eggs to preserve your fertility  Our success rates  IVF cost  IVF money-back guarantees  Money back guarantee plans for frozen donor eggs  Day 5 blastocyst transfer  IVF steps - calendar  Infertility insurance issues / plans          CHICAGO        4920 N.

I am 26 years old and I was diagnosed with PCOS back in 2000. I had been off birth control since I was 18 and never got pregnant. The doctor always tried to put me on it to help make my period regular and I declined because I wanted kids. I too had a surgery to remove 41 cysts in 2001 and havent had to have another one yet. My periods were never regular. I also tried metaformin still no pregnancy. Then January of this year I got pregnant. Miscarriage rate is 40% for someone with PCOS, but I took metformin that my OB recommended to reduce the risk and I had a health boy this September. I had already adopted children a few years ago, because I had felt there was no hope and it just seemed as thou I would never have my own children, I finally gave up and that is when I got pregnant. My first sign of pregnancy was the sore breasts. So, keep your head up.                 5boyslater    Answered 10/28/07                144 found this helpful     I was recently diagnosed with PCOS. I did not find this out until my husband and I had been trying to conceive for 6 months and were unsuccessful. My periods were very irregular and occurring only every 3 months as well as other symptoms including excessive chin hair, acne, and a high testosterone level. We were fortunately able to conceive with the help of a combination of Provera, Clomid, and Metformin that my OB/GYN prescribed. Due to the irregular periods, Provera induced a period and Clomid and Metformin allowed me to ovulate. We conceived on the very first cycle! I am now 6 weeks pregnant and will continue to take Metformin throughout my first trimester per my OB/GYN to help in the prevention of miscarriage. I was told that by taking Metformin, my risk will be lowered to the same % as any other normal woman during pregnancy. Please don't lose hope. I am living proof that it IS possible! Godd luck to everyone!                 sunnyaz1    Answered 11/29/07               128 found this helpful     I don't know if this was just a coincidence, but I was diagnosed with PCOS a month ago, was put on Metformin and got pregnant 4 days after I started the medication. I have heard though, that it is very common to get pregnant once you start taking Metformin. Good luck!

The stress factor also place a big roll in getting pregnant, girls you just need to relax and enjoy sex dont think about getting pregnant. so more water less caffeen and enjoy sex! but i have a question if anyone can help me with it, we are tryin to have another baby (yeah i know it is soon) but is it going to be just as difficult to have a second child as it was the first? by the way it took 6 years for me to finally conceive.                 CrystalRoyal    Answered 10/11/07               69 found this helpful     I was diagnosed with PCOS in 05' while seeing a fertility specialist. I had had 3 previous pregnancies on my own, without the help of a doctor, in a span of 6 years that all ended up with miscarriage. Finally the doctor I was seeing diagnosed me with PCOS and put me on Metformin, baby asparin, a carb free diet, and fertility shots since I only ovulate a couple of times a year due to PCOS. On the third round, I conceived and she put me on progesteone among the other meds to help me hold the pregnancy. While it was hard, and I almost lost him at 7 weeks and ended up on bedrest almost the whole pregnancy, I am now the proud mother of a very healthy 6 month old baby boy. I am also trying for a another one since I heard that those with fertility problems have an easier time getting pregnant naturally the second time around. Good luck and keeping trying.

My daughter is now 9 months old and I love her to death. I want to try again. Metformin worked for me!!                 BigBodyChic    Answered 2/3/09               60 found this helpful     I was diagnosed with PCOS two years ago and went through treatment to regulate my period. I am not on any treatment right now only keeping track of my menstral cycles and length of it. I too am trying to have a baby. My doctor mentioned that there is a big chance of me being able to get pregnant since I am somewhat regular now. Fertility treatment may be needed if my period returns to a crazy schedule. I hope this was helpful to you. Good Luck in trying!                 babylavalla2007    Answered 9/18/07               59 found this helpful     I just got diagnosed with PCOS a few weeks ago. I just got a laparoscopy surgergy done because me tubes were clogged and I had cysts on my ovaries. I would highly recomend seeing an ob/gyn. My husband and I tried for 7 months and finally I went to the gyno just for a check up. Thats when he found cysts. I'm glad I did. Otherwise I had no chance of getting pregnant. He is going to be putting me on fertility meds to help me ovulate. Hope this helps you, good luck to you!                 Alicia42906    Answered 10/24/07               57 found this helpful     Id like to share a very positive experience with Metformin. I was diagnosed with PCOS after very irregular periods and anovulatory cycles. I already worked out regularly and was a healthy weight. My husband and I tried for a very long time to conceive and were starting to lose hope. I started taking Metformin 1500mg per day. I found it without Rx (my friend share with me this code * METF4PREG *, you can Google it.) I experienced mild stomach discomfort and no other side effects. The first month, my cycle length was cut in half and the second month, I got pregnant! I never thought the day would come that I would see a positive pregnancy test. I continued the Metformin through my first trimester and we now have a perfect baby boy. Keep your head up and give it a try...I am so thankful that I did!

While it can make conception more difficult, there’s almost always a way to treat a woman with PCOS so she can ovulate normally, conceive, and have a healthy pregnancy. PCOS — short for polycystic ovarian syndrome — is one of the most common causes of female infertility. Because it affects as many as 5 million American women (or about 8 to 10 percent of women of childbearing age), there’s a good chance you or someone you know has it. While this condition can make conceiving more challenging (and it raises the risk of certain pregnancy complications once you do conceive), women with PCOS deliver healthy babies every day. Here’s what you need to know to boost your odds of getting pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy. What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)? Eggs grow in the ovaries inside tiny fluid-filled sacs called follicles. When an egg reaches maturation each month, the follicle containing it breaks open to release it (this process is ovulation ). PCOS interferes with ovulation. Women with PCOS produce higher-than-normal levels of the male hormone testosterone, and those high levels of male hormones get in the way of ovulation, causing women with PCOS to have irregular or absent periods and ovulation. These fluid-filled follicles don’t burst, and instead remain in the ovaries as cysts — thus the name poly (meaning many)-cystic ovarian syndrome. What Causes PCOS? While doctors are not sure about the precise causes of PCOS, the following factors have been linked to the condition: Genetics. PCOS appears to run in families, so if your mom or close female relative has PCOS, your chances of also having it are higher. Excess insulin. Researchers have found that women with PCOS tend to have high levels of insulin (the hormone that regulates how your body breaks down sugar) because their bodies have a hard time using it properly. Insulin also controls ovarian function, and too much insulin in the body can cause irregular or absent ovulation. Being overweight or obese. While overweight women are at greater risk for PCOS and women with PCOS are at greater risk of becoming overweight, the jury is out on whether excess weight causes PCOS or vice versa. Even so, if you're trying to conceive, it’s a good idea to start eating healthy foods and exercising . What Are the Symptoms of PCOS? An irregular period isn’t the only sign of PCOS (and an unpredictable cycle isn’t necessarily a sign that you have PCOS, either). You might also notice acne , excessive hair growth on the face or other parts of the body, weight gain , and occasionally prolonged vaginal bleeding. More than 1 in 2 women with PCOS also develops Type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance) or pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance) before the age of 40. Because many women who don’t have PCOS may also have these symptoms, you’ll want consult your doctor if you have irregular periods or suddenly develop any of the symptoms above. Your practitioner will consider whether you’ve had them in the past and look carefully at your family history. She’ll also examine areas of increased hair growth, conduct blood tests, and perform a pelvic exam or ultrasound to check for ovarian cysts (though it’s totally possible to have PCOS but no cysts). Treating PCOS While PCOS can’t be cured, a healthy lifestyle can help manage your symptoms. Your practitioner can help determine the best treatment for you based on your medical history. A well-balanced diet that’s rich in complex carbs and low in refined carbs and sugar may help restore ovulation and regular periods in women with PCOS. Losing weight can also help treat PCOS. Studies suggest that losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can improve insulin levels, normalize your hormone levels, and regulate your menstrual cycle. (Of course, more weight loss is better if you have more than 5 to 10 percent of your body weight to lose to reach an ideal BMI, so get a personalized weight-loss recommendation from your practitioner.) If you’re not currently trying to conceive (or are done having kids), your practitioner may recommend taking birth control with progesterone to reduce levels of male hormones and regulate your period. Conceiving With PCOS If you’ve been diagnosed with PCOS and are having trouble conceiving, there are number of treatment options for you: Metformin. Although this diabetes medication, which helps regulate the amount of insulin in your blood, isn’t approved by the FDA for treating PCOS, research suggests that it and other diabetes medications may help with fertility, so ask your doctor if it’s right for you. Clomiphene citrate (Clomid). This drug stimulates ovulation and has been a standard infertility treatment for years, including in women with PCOS. Clomid might sometimes be used in conjunction with metformin in helping women with PCOS conceive. Letrozole (Femara). This ovulation inducer is being used more and more often to treat ovulation issues, and can work very well for women with PCOS. Femara can also be used with metformin to help boost the odds for conception success. Hormone shots. If Femara or Clomid, with or without metformin, doesn’t help with conception, injectable fertility drugs can be the next step for women with PCOS. IVF. If none of the above treatments work, in vitro fertilization can help make pregnancy a reality for women with PCOS. Ovarian drilling. In this surgical procedure, the doctor inserts a thin needle through the abdomen (laparoscopically) and cauterizes (burns) small areas of the ovaries to lower the levels of male hormones they produce. The idea behind the procedure is to help improve ovulation, but studies show the results of ovarian drilling are inconsistent and not all practitioners recommend this treatment for PCOS. A 2017 study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found that adequate vitamin D levels could help women with PCOS conceive and have successful, healthy pregnancies. Researchers found that women with PCOS who were vitamin D deficient were 40 percent more likely to have trouble getting pregnant and giving birth to healthy babies than those who weren't vitamin D deficient. And a small 2014 study also found that eating just one teaspoon of cinnamon daily — a spice known to help regulate insulin levels — is a safe and possibly effective way to normalize your cycles and boost your odds of conceiving, too. It can’t hurt to try, so see if sprinkling a spoonful on your morning oatmeal for a few months makes your period more regular. What You Need to Know About PCOS During Pregnancy If you’ve been suffering from PCOS, getting pregnant was likely a hurdle. Once you conceive (congratulations!), it will hopefully be smoother sailing ahead — though you should be aware that moms-to-be with PCOS are more likely to experience certain pregnancy complications. Women with PCOS are three times more likely to miscarry and are more at risk for gestational diabetes , inflammation, prenatal depression , heart disease, high blood pressure , and preeclampsia . Moms-to-be are also more likely to require a C-section , while their babies are more likely to be born preterm and spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Your best bet if you’re expecting with PCOS? Work with your doctor to outline a plan of attack. Gaining the right amount of weight based on your preconception BMI by eating well and staying active is always a good way to reduce your risk of pregnancy complications. Researchers also think the diabetes drug metformin may reduce the chances of having problems while pregnant, since it lowers male hormone levels and can limit weight gain if you’re overweight or obese. More research needs to be done to confirm its safety, but so far the studies that have been done show promising results. Talk to your practitioner about whether it’s an appropriate option for you. PCOS can have an impact on your fertility and your pregnancy, but with the right care and treatment, conception and a healthy pregnancy are completely possible — and probable!

While research has not yet determined how to cure for PCOS, it may be possible for a woman with PCOS to increase her odds of getting pregnant with the right treatment or treatments.  When trying to get pregnant, most women with PCOS will not experience any major problems.  However, for those that do, PCOS can be an extremely frustrating condition.  PCOS can cause a variety of problems, from a delay in conception to higher miscarriage rates to complications with pregnancy.  For some women, the first symptoms of PCOS are that they are having very few or even no periods.  This typically is measured by having less than 9 periods in a twelve month timeframe.  Some women with PCOS will have no period whatsoever.  Some women with polycystic ovarian disease will have regular periods, but may not ovulate every month, or at all.  One of the most popular treatments for infertility in women with polycystic ovaries is Clomid.  Clomid is used to stimulate ovulation.  Clomid will help around 4 out of 5 women ovulate, and can greatly increase a woman’s odds of getting pregnant.  Around 45% of women with PCOS who use Clomid will be able to conceive within four to six cycles.  Clomid does carry an increased risk of having a multiple or twin pregnancy.     If Clomid does not successfully treat infertility, the next step is often to use hormones to try to stimulate the ovaries into producing eggs.  Here again, this treatment, referred to as ovarian stimulation, carries the risk of multiple or twin pregnancy.  There is a surgical procedure that is similar to ovarian stimulation.  Known as Overian drilling, this operation uses the making of several small holes in each ovary with a fine probe or laser.  For some women, this can restore ovulation, or at least make their ovaries more likely to respond to Clomid.  Somewhere around 60% of women with PCOS will experience success with ovarian drilling or ovarian stimulation, and have regular cycles after the treatments, if there are not any additional problems with fertility.  A more radical procedure, IVF or in vitro fertilization, remains an option for a woman who has not responded to other treatments and wants to get pregnant.  The success rates of IVF can vary greatly depending on a variety of individual factors, including the length of infertility, weight, and age.  Getting pregnant with Polycystic Ovaries can be challenging.  However, the methods listed above greatly increase the odds that a woman with polycystic overies has of getting pregnant.

Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.

PCOS Glossary Reference sources  PCOS Pregnancy and Delivery Complications Women with PCOS are at higher risk for pregnancy and delivery complications. These include a three-fold increase in miscarriage risk in early pregnancy compared to women without PCOS, gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) which can lead to large babies, preeclampsia which is characterized by sudden elevated blood pressure and body swelling after the 20th week of pregnancy, preterm birth, and C-section delivery. Diabetes during pregnancy is a concern many women with PCOS must face. The following information is published with permission from the Hormone Health Network , the public education arm of the Endocrine Society. It has been extracted from the Diabetes and Pregnancy patient guide. What care do you need during pregnancy? Blood glucose. While pregnant, you will probably need to check your blood sugar more often than before pregnancy. Check your blood sugar as often as your doctor recommends. You should probably test it before meals, one or two hours after a meal, at bedtime, and during the night. Ask your doctor what your blood glucose numbers should be. Most pregnant women with diabetes should aim for these blood sugar levels as long as they do not cause low blood sugar: Before meals (fasting blood glucose) One hour after the start of a meal: 140 mg/dL or less Two hours after the start of a meal: 120 mg/dL or less Insulin. If you were already using an insulin pump before pregnancy, you should keep using it. You probably should not start using an insulin pump for the first time during pregnancy. But if other types of insulin treatment do not control your blood sugar, your doctor may want you to switch to an insulin pump. Medical nutrition therapy. You should see a dietitian for nutrition therapy. This healthy eating plan, tailored to you, helps make sure you get the nutrients you need and gain the right amount of weight, while controlling your blood sugar. The dietitian may suggest you limit the amount of carbohydrates, or “carbs” (for instance, potatoes, bread, and fruit), that you eat. It is a good idea to eat three small meals and two to four snacks a day. Your dietitian also will advise how often to eat and how many calories to eat a day. Vitamins. Your doctor likely will decrease the dose of folic acid you take once you finish your first trimester of pregnancy (week 12). Most often, the recommended dose of folic acid is 0.4 mg (400 micrograms) to 1 mg per day through the rest of pregnancy and until you stop breastfeeding. Ask your doctor what other prenatal vitamins you need. Will you be able to breastfeed? Women with diabetes are encouraged to breastfeed their baby. Breastfeeding lowers your baby’s risk for childhood obesity and for type 2 diabetes later in life. Women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes; breastfeeding seems to lower that risk. It also may help you lose the weight you gained during pregnancy! Insulin is safe for breastfeeding women. If you take metformin or glyburide pills to treat type 2 diabetes, you can safely continue taking these medications while breastfeeding. What can you do to help have a healthy baby? You can help ensure your baby’s health and your own health. Work with your obstetrician and your diabetes specialist to get proper medical care before, during, and after pregnancy. Take your diabetes medicine as prescribed and keep your blood sugar in control. Follow the healthy eating plan that you made with your health care team. Also, be physically active. Ask your doctor what type of activity is best for you. The good news is that with careful planning, proper medical care, and good self-care, you can have a safe pregnancy and a healthy baby.

Women with PCOS have a hormonal imbalance and metabolism problems that may affect their overall health and appearance. PCOS is also a common and treatable cause of infertility.          Expand all  |  Collapse all      What is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?   Polycystic  (pah-lee-SIS-tik) ovary syndrome (PCOS), also known as polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common health problem caused by an imbalance of reproductive hormones . The hormonal imbalance creates problems in the ovaries . The ovaries make the egg that is released each month as part of a healthy menstrual cycle. With PCOS, the egg may not develop as it should or it may not be released during ovulation as it should be.  PCOS can cause missed or irregular menstrual periods. Irregular periods can lead to:   Infertility (inability to get pregnant). In fact, PCOS is one of the most common causes of female infertility.  Development of cysts (small fluid-filled sacs) in the ovaries      Who gets PCOS?   Between 5% and 10% of women of childbearing age (between 15 and 44) have PCOS. 1 Most often, women find out they have PCOS in their 20s and 30s, when they have problems getting pregnant and see their doctor. But PCOS can happen at any age after puberty. 2  Women of all races and ethnicities are at risk for PCOS, but your risk for PCOS may be higher if you are obese or if you have a mother, sister, or aunt with PCOS.     What are the symptoms of PCOS?   Some of the symptoms of PCOS include:   Irregular menstrual cycle . Women with PCOS may miss periods or have fewer periods (fewer than eight in a year). Or, their periods may come every 21 days or more often. Some women with PCOS stop having menstrual periods.  Too much hair on the face, chin, or parts of the body where men usually have hair. This is called "hirsutism." Hirsutism affects up to 70% of women with PCOS. 3  Acne on the face, chest, and upper back  Thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp; male-pattern baldness  Weight gain or difficulty losing weight  Darkening of skin , particularly along neck creases, in the groin, and underneath breasts  Skin tags , which are small excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area      What causes PCOS?   The exact cause of PCOS is not known. Most experts think that several factors, including genetics, play a role:   High levels of androgens (AN-druh-junz) . Androgens are sometimes called "male hormones," although all women make small amounts of androgens. Androgens control the development of male traits, such as male-pattern baldness. Women with PCOS have more androgens than normal. Estrogens are also called "female hormones." Higher than normal androgen levels in women can prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation) during each menstrual cycle, and can cause extra hair growth and acne, two signs of PCOS.  High levels of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls how the food you eat is changed into energy. Insulin resistance is when the body's cells do not respond normally to insulin. As a result, your insulin blood levels become higher than normal. Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance, especially those who are overweight or obese, have unhealthy eating habits, do not get enough physical activity, and have a family history of diabetes (usually type 2 diabetes). Over time, insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes.      Can I still get pregnant if I have PCOS?   Yes. Having PCOS does not mean you can't get pregnant. PCOS is one of the most common, but treatable, causes of infertility in women. In women with PCOS, the hormonal imbalance interferes with the growth and release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation). If you don't ovulate, you can't get pregnant.  Your doctor can talk with you about ways to help you ovulate and to raise your chance of getting pregnant .     Does PCOS raise my risk for other health problems?   Yes, studies have found links between PCOS and other health problems, including:   Diabetes. More than half of women with PCOS will have diabetes or pre-diabetes (glucose intolerance) before the age of 40. 4 Learn more about diabetes on our Diabetes page .  High blood pressure. Women with PCOS are at greater risk of having high blood pressure compared with women of the same age without PCOS. High blood pressure is a leading cause of heart disease and stroke. Learn more about heart disease and stroke.  Unhealthy cholesterol. Women with PCOS often have higher levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. High cholesterol raises your risk for heart disease and stroke.  Sleep apnea. This is when momentary and repeated stops in breathing interrupt sleep. Many women with PCOS are overweight or obese, which can cause sleep apnea. Sleep apnea raises your risk for heart disease and diabetes.  Depression and anxiety.  Depression and anxiety are common among women with PCOS.  Endometrial cancer. Problems with ovulation, obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes (all common in women with PCOS) increase the risk of developing cancer of the endometrium (lining of the uterus or womb).      Will my PCOS symptoms go away at menopause?   Yes and no. PCOS affects many systems in the body. Many women with PCOS find that their menstrual cycles become more regular as they get closer to menopause . However, their PCOS hormonal imbalance does not change with age, so they may continue to have symptoms of PCOS.  Also, the risks of PCOS-related health problems, such as diabetes, stroke, and heart attack, increase with age. These risks may be higher in women with PCOS than those without.     How is PCOS diagnosed?   There is no single test to diagnose PCOS. To help diagnose PCOS and rule out other causes of your symptoms, your doctor may talk to you about your medical history and do a physical exam and different tests:   Physical exam. Your doctor will measure your blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) , and waist size. He or she will also look at your skin for extra hair on your face, chest or back, acne, or skin discoloration. Your doctor may look for any hair loss or signs of other health conditions (such as an enlarged thyroid gland).  Pelvic exam. Your doctor may do a pelvic exam for signs of extra male hormones (for example, an enlarged clitoris) and check to see if your ovaries are enlarged or swollen.  Pelvic ultrasound (sonogram). This test uses soundwaves to examine your ovaries for cysts and check the endometrium (lining of the uterus or womb).  Blood tests. Blood tests check your androgen hormone levels, sometimes called "male hormones." Your doctor will also check for other hormones related to other common health problems that can be mistaken for PCOS, such as thyroid disease . Your doctor may also test your cholesterol levels and test you for diabetes.   Once other conditions are ruled out, you may be diagnosed with PCOS if you have at least two of the following symptoms: 5   Irregular periods, including periods that come too often, not often enough, or not at all  Signs that you have high levels of androgens:  Extra hair growth on your face, chin, and body (hirsutism)  Acne  Thinning of scalp hair    Higher than normal blood levels of androgens  Multiple cysts on one or both ovaries      How is PCOS treated?   There is no cure for PCOS, but you can manage the symptoms of PCOS. You and your doctor will work on a treatment plan based on your symptoms, your plans for children, and your risk for long-term health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Many women will need a combination of treatments, including:   Steps you can take at home to help relieve your symptoms  Medicines      What steps can I take at home to improve my PCOS symptoms?   You can take steps at home to help your PCOS symptoms, including:   Losing weight. Healthy eating habits and regular physical activity can help relieve PCOS-related symptoms. Losing weight may help to lower your blood glucose levels, improve the way your body uses insulin, and help your hormones reach normal levels. Even a 10% loss in body weight (for example, a 150-pound woman losing 15 pounds) can help make your menstrual cycle more regular and improve your chances of getting pregnant. 3 Learn more about fitness and nutrition .  Removing hair. You can try facial hair removal creams, laser hair removal, or electrolysis to remove excess hair. You can find hair removal creams and products at drugstores. Procedures like laser hair removal or electrolysis must be done by a doctor and may not be covered by health insurance.  Slowing hair growth. A prescription skin treatment (eflornithine HCl cream) can help slow down the growth rate of new hair in unwanted places.      What types of medicines treat PCOS?   The types of medicines that treat PCOS and its symptoms include:   Hormonal birth control, including the pill, patch, shot, vaginal ring, and hormone intrauterine device (IUD). For women who don't want to get pregnant, hormonal birth control can:  Make your menstrual cycle more regular  Lower your risk of endometrial cancer  Help improve acne and reduce extra hair on the face and body (Ask your doctor about birth control with both estrogen and progesterone.)    Anti-androgen medicines. These medicines block the effect of androgens and can help reduce scalp hair loss, facial and body hair growth, and acne. They are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PCOS symptoms. These medicines can also cause problems during pregnancy.  Metformin. Metformin is often used to treat type 2 diabetes and may help some women with PCOS symptoms. It is not approved by the FDA to treat PCOS symptoms. Metformin improves insulin's ability to lower your blood sugar and can lower both insulin and androgen levels. After a few months of use, metformin may help restart ovulation, but it usually has little effect on acne and extra hair on the face or body. Recent research shows that metformin may have other positive effects, including lowering body mass and improving cholesterol levels.      What are my treatment options for PCOS if I want to get pregnant?   You have several options to help your chances of getting pregnant if you have PCOS:   Losing weight. If you are overweight or obese, losing weight through healthy eating, including eating the right amount of calories for you , and regular physical activity can help make your menstrual cycle more regular and improve your fertility.  Medicine. After ruling out other causes of infertility in you and your partner, your doctor might prescribe medicine to help you ovulate, such as clomiphene (Clomid).  In vitro fertilization (IVF). IVF may be an option if medicine does not work. In IVF, your egg is fertilized with your partner's sperm in a laboratory and then placed in your uterus to implant and develop. Compared to medicine alone, IVF has higher pregnancy rates and better control over your risk for twins and triplets (by allowing your doctor to transfer a single fertilized egg into your uterus).  Surgery. Surgery is also an option, usually only if the other options do not work. The outer shell (called the cortex ) of ovaries is thickened in women with PCOS and thought to play a role in preventing spontaneous ovulation. Ovarian drilling is a surgery in which the doctor makes a few holes in the surface of your ovary using lasers or a fine needle heated with electricity. Surgery usually restores ovulation, but only for six to eight months.   Read more about treating infertility in PCOS .     How does PCOS affect pregnancy?   PCOS can cause problems during pregnancy for you and for your baby. Women with PCOS have higher rates of: 6   Miscarriage  Gestational diabetes  Preeclampsia  Cesarean section (C-section)   Your baby also has a higher risk of being heavy (macrosomia) and of spending more time in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).     How can I prevent problems from PCOS during pregnancy?   You can lower your risk of problems during pregnancy by:   Reaching a healthy weight before you get pregnant. Use this interactive tool to see your healthy weight before pregnancy and what to gain during pregnancy.  Reaching healthy blood sugar levels before you get pregnant. You can do this through a combination of healthy eating habits, regular physical activity, weight loss, and medicines such as metformin.  Taking folic acid . Talk to your doctor about how much folic acid you need.      What is the latest research on PCOS?   Researchers continue to search for new ways to treat PCOS. Some current studies focus on:   Genetics and PCOS  Environmental exposure and PCOS risk  Ethnic and racial differences in PCOS symptoms  Medicines and supplements to restart ovulation  Obesity and its link to PCOS  Health risks for children of women with PCOS   To learn more about current PCOS treatment studies, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .

Newsletter What You Should Know About Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and Pregnancy Medically reviewed by Suzanne Falck, MD, FACP on  November 2, 2016 — Written by Chaunie Brusie, RN, BSN Risks for moms Risks for baby Conceiving Breast-feeding Definition Symptoms Treatment Next steps    Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects between 6 and 15 percent of women of childbearing age. If you’re diagnosed with PCOS, it may be more difficult to become pregnant. And if you’re able to become pregnant, you’re at risk for more complications during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.  Women with PCOS are three times more likely to have a miscarriage, as compared to women who don’t have PCOS. They are also more likely to develop preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and have a larger baby and premature delivery. This could lead to difficulty during delivery or a cesarean delivery.  Risks for moms Risks for
moms-to-be with PCOS  Having PCOS might make it harder for you to get pregnant. Hormonal imbalances might be to blame.  Women with PCOS are more likely to be obese and to rely on reproductive technology to get pregnant. One study found that 60 percent of women with PCOS are obese. Almost 14 percent required reproductive technology to get pregnant.  Women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing several medical complications throughout life, including:  insulin resistance type 2 diabetes high cholesterol high blood pressure heart disease stroke sleep apnea possibly an increased risk of endometrial cancer  For pregnant women, PCOS brings an increased risk of complications. This includes preeclampsia, a dangerous condition for both mother and baby-to-be. There is no treatment for preeclampsia. If you develop it during your pregnancy, you will have to be monitored extremely closely. Other concerns include pregnancy-induced hypertension (high blood pressure) and gestational diabetes.  Having gestational diabetes could lead to you having a larger-than-average baby. This could lead to problems during delivery. For example, larger babies are more at risk for shoulder dystocia (when the baby's shoulder gets stuck during labor).  Most PCOS symptoms during pregnancy can be treated with careful monitoring. If you develop gestational diabetes, insulin may be required to keep your blood sugar levels stable.  Risks for baby Risks for baby  Unfortunately, having PCOS during pregnancy makes things a little more complicated. It will require more monitoring for both you and your baby.  The potential risks with PCOS for the baby include:  premature birth large for gestational age increased risk of meconium aspiration miscarriage lower Apgar score  If your baby is a girl, some studies have shown that there is up to a 50 percent chance that she will also have PCOS.  Women with PCOS are also more likely to deliver by cesarean because they tend to have larger-sized babies. Other complications may also come up during labor and delivery.  Conceiving Getting pregnant with PCOS  Some women may not realize they have PCOS until they try to conceive. PCOS often goes unnoticed. But if you’ve been trying to conceive naturally for over a year, you should speak to your doctor about getting tested.  Your doctor can help you develop a plan for getting pregnant. Some strategies, such as losing weight, healthy eating, and in certain cases, medications, can increase your chances for getting pregnant.  Breast-feeding PCOS and breast-feeding  If you’re diagnosed with PCOS, you may need to continue to manage symptoms even after pregnancy. But symptoms and severity can vary. Sometimes the hormonal fluctuations after pregnancy and breast-feeding can change the symptoms, so it may be awhile before you settle into your new "normal."  It’s safe to breast-feed with PCOS, even if you’re on insulin medication to help control your blood sugar. Women who have gestational diabetes are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life, but breast-feeding can help lower that risk .  Breast-feeding has many benefits for both you and your baby, so if it fits your family, be sure to explore the options and available resources so you can have a successful breast-feeding experience.  Definition What is PCOS?  PCOS, also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a hormonal imbalance that affects women. It’s characterized by the production of too many androgens, or "male" hormones.  PCOS can cause women to develop excessive hair and acne. It can also cause cysts on the ovaries and interrupt normal menstrual cycles.  It's a tricky condition because there’s not one single test to diagnose it. Instead, doctors look at the clues of what's going on in your body. Excessive hair growth or irregular periods might be signs. Doctors can then piece together a picture of PCOS.  Symptoms PCOS symptoms  PCOS often gets missed in women because of the difficulty of making a diagnosis. The symptoms can vary and occur in many different types of women.  Obesity or weight gain, for example, can be a frequent occurrence with PCOS. But it's not a given. Many women with PCOS have lean body shapes.  Unfortunately, up to 50 percent of women who have PCOS never actually get diagnosed. Because of this, PCOS is sometimes called the silent killer.  Some of the more common symptoms of PCOS include:  "string of pearl" cysts on the ovaries insulin resistance high testosterone causing excessive hair growth, male pattern baldness, and acne suppressed ovulation excessive weight gain weight gain on the waistline dark, thick patches of skin on the neck, arms, breasts, or thighs skin tags in the armpits or neck area pelvic pain anxiety or depression sleep apnea  Treatment Treatment  There’s currently no treatment for PCOS. But it’s possible to manage symptoms.  Options to help manage symptoms include:  birth control pills weight loss spironolactone other androgen blockers  Along with other fertility drugs, metformin, which helps to control blood sugar, is commonly prescribed to help induce ovulation.  Note: You’ll need to stop taking some of these medications if you become pregnant. Work with your doctor to develop a plan that fits your needs.  Next steps Next steps  The most important thing to know about PCOS and pregnancy is that complications are very real. That’s why it’s more important than ever to take steps to have a healthy pregnancy.  Talk to your doctor, follow a pregnancy-safe exercise and diet program, and take medication as directed. These are all recommended regimens for controlling PCOS during pregnancy.

Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.

Diagnosing PCO with ultrasound - What does a polycystic ovary look like?  In a polycystic ovary, the numerous small cystic structures, also called antral follicles , give the ovaries a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound.

IVF clinics are not all the same - learn more about IVF pregnancy success rates .     Controlling Multiple Pregnancy Risks with PCOS   Using injectable gonadotropins to treat PCOS infertility has a high risk for high-order multiple pregnancy (triplets and higher). The level of risk is unacceptable for some couples  Recent advances in IVF technologies have resulted in the ability to maintain high pregnancy rates while controlling multiple pregnancy risk  Blastocyst embryo transfer is a variant of the standard IVF treatment that is useful in controlling multiple birth rates      Our IVF PCOS Success Rates and Statistics   In general, IVF success rates are excellent for cases with infertility caused by PCOS  In our in vitro fertilization program we see PCOS pregnancy statistics of about 60% for a live birth rate per egg retrieval (woman under age 35). This is dependent on several factors including whether one or two embryos are transferred to the uterus.  We have had many PCOS IVF success stories...  See our IVF live birth success rates      IVF Protocols for PCOS  We specialize in treating women with PCOS and have 2 IVF stimulation protocols that we commonly use with PCOS:    Ganirelix with Lupron trigger protocol - this is what we currently use in order to avoid ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome .  PCOS down-regulation protocol (below)   The down-regulation PCOS IVF protocol combines:   Metformin   Oral contraceptive pills  Lupron down-regulation ovarian stimulation protocol      The calendar below shows the down-regulation  protocol for PCOS   We use metformin, usually at a dose of 500mg 3 times daily for at least a month before starting Lupron  Then, oral contraceptive pills for about 21 days (last 4 days of OCP shown on calendar)  Lupron overlaps with the last 3 birth control pills  Ovarian stimulation starts after 6 or 7 "pill free" days  Careful control of the dose of injectable FSH hormone and cautious monitoring of the ovarian response is important with polycystic ovary cases  We do our very best to avoid over-responding, which can result in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome     Sunday  Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday    1  OCP  2  OCP/Lupron  3  OCP/Lupron  4  OCP/Lupron  5  Lupron  6  Lupron  7  Lupron    8  Lupron  9  Lupron  10  Lupron  11  Lupron  Start ovarian stimulation Day 1 of stim  12  Lupron Day 2 of stim  13  Lupron Day 3 of stim  14  Lupron Day 4 of stim    15  Lupron Day 5 of stim  16  Lupron Day 6 of stim  17  Lupron Day 7 of stim  18  Lupron Day 8 of stim  19  Lupron Day 9 of stim  20  Lupron  HCG injection Day 10 of stim  21    22  Egg retrieval  Day of fertilization  23  24  25  Day 3 transfer  26  27  Day 5 transfer  28      Key to table:   Lupron = subcutaneous injection of a medication called Lupron (GnRH agonist). This medication is taken once daily  HCG injection = injection of a medication called HCG, which causes the eggs to complete maturation. This is taken only once in the cycle.  Egg retrieval procedure = the procedure that gets eggs from the ovaries   Embryo transfer procedure = the procedure putting embryos back in the uterus   Most women need  4 to 6 visits for monitoring the stimulation (not shown on this calendar) before they get the HCG trigger shot  The duration of the ovarian stimulation process can be shorter or longer than shown. This example shows 10 days of stimulation   before the HCG trigger  The average number of days of stimulation is 9-10, with a range of 7 to 14 days   Related Articles   Lupron trigger IVF protocol to avoid hyperstimulation syndrome  Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)  PCOS Treatment Options  PCOS Clomid Fertility Treatment  Injectable FSH Hormone for PCOS Treatment  Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS Treatment  Metformin for PCOS  PCO Laparoscopy        Quick Links   Freeze some eggs to preserve your fertility  Our success rates  IVF cost  IVF money-back guarantees  Money back guarantee plans for frozen donor eggs  Day 5 blastocyst transfer  IVF steps - calendar  Infertility insurance issues / plans          CHICAGO        4920 N.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a common cause of female infertility. The ovaries in these women contain multiple small cystic structures, or antral follicles , that are 2-9 mm in diameter.   The ovaries have a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound     Ultrasound image of PCOS ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"   For a more detailed general explanation of PCOS, see: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, PCOS   Women with PCOS syndrome do not ovulate (release eggs) regularly and therefore have irregular menstrual cycles  Therefore, treatment for infertility caused by PCOS  is directed at getting the woman to ovulate  Doctors call this "induction of ovulation"      What is induction of ovulation?  Ovulation induction involves the use of medication to stimulate development of one or more mature follicles (where eggs develop) in the ovaries of women who have ovulation problems and infertility.     PCOS Fertility Treatment - Inducing Ovulation  Treatment Options  There are several possible ways to attempt ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovaries, including:   Clomid, clomiphene citrate  Metformin  Clomid and metformin together  Femara, letrozole  Injectable gonadotropins  IVF, In Vitro Fertilization      PCOS Pregnancy Statistics  Pregnancy success rates with induction of ovulation vary considerably and depend on:  The age of the woman  The type of PCOS meds used  Whether the medication used is effective at stimulating ovulation in that woman  Whether there are other infertility factors present in the couple   In general, successful treatment resulting in pregnancy is more likely to occur in the first 3 to 4 months of treatment. After that, the monthly success rate drops off considerably.  The approximate average monthly pregnancy success rate (female age under 35, normal sperm) for the major types of treatment used for PCOS are:    Treatment for PCOS  Expected "Monthly" Success Rate    Metformin alone  About 1-2%    Clomid  15% - if ovulating    Femara  15% - if ovulating    Injectable gonadotropins  20%    IVF, In vitro fertilization  60% - at our IVF clinic       A brief overview of each PCOS treatment option is below  For details see the pages that discuss each treatment option  Clomid   The least complicated method is the use of Clomid tablets, also called Serophene, or clomiphene citrate  Many will be able to get pregnant using clomiphene to induce ovulation  Clomiphene is usually the first line of treatment   Details about  Clomid for treatment of polycystic ovarian disease and infertility     Femara (Letrozole)  Femara (generic name is letrozole) is an oral drug which can be effective in stimulating ovulation in some women with polycystic ovaries and anovulation.  Some women that do not respond and ovulate with Clomid will respond well to letrozole. Other women that do ovulate with Clomid may never get pregnant on it, and could do better with letrozole.  Details about Femara (letrozole) for PCOS treatment       Injectable Gonadotropins (FSH Hormones)  For women that do not ovulate with clomiphene, the "traditional" next step has been to use injectable gonadotropins. The woman takes daily shots of FSH hormone for about 7 to 15 days in order to stimulate mature follicle development.  Risks and Side Effects   The injectable medications are expensive  Beware of multiple birth risks with this treatment option - there are risks for triplets and higher order multiple pregnancies  There are risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome  The daily injections and multiple trips to the office for monitoring are  inconvenient  Injectables for PCOS treatment     IVF - In Vitro Fertilization  The large majority of women with PCOS that have not gotten pregnant with other treatments will be able to have success with IVF if they are under 40 years of age and have their IVF performed at a high quality clinic.  IVF clinics are not all the same - learn more about IVF pregnancy success rates  Success Rates   In general, IVF success rates are excellent in cases with infertility caused by PCOS  In our in vitro fertilization program we see PCOS pregnancy statistics of about 60% for a live birth rate (woman under age 35)   Our IVF success rate statistics   We specialize in treating women with PCOS and have many IVF PCOS success stories   We usually use a PCOS IVF protocol combining metformin, oral contraceptive pills, and the Lupron down-regulation stimulation protocol  Recent advances in IVF technologies have resulted in the ability to maintain high success rates while controlling multiple pregnancy risks  Blastocyst embryo transfer is a variant of standard IVF treatment that is useful in controlling multiple birth risks   Details about IVF treatment for PCOS     Metformin  Oral medications such as metformin (brand name Glucophage) can be used to try to stimulate ovulation with PCOS. It can be used with or without Clomid.   Metformin is an "insulin sensitizing agent" primarily used to control diabetes.   Success Rates  Not many couples will get pregnant using metformin alone. However, some women will respond to metformin and clomiphene when they are used in combination.  Some will not ovulate even with the combination therapy and  will need  either injectable FSH medications, or IVF to have a baby.  Side Effects  Metformin has unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea in about 25% of patients.  Metformin for PCOS and fertility treatment     Cost for Induction of Ovulation and PCOS Treatments  The costs associated with induction of ovulation depend on:   The type and dose of medication required.  The number of ultrasound and blood tests  required to properly monitor the cycle.  Sometimes artificial insemination will  be recommended, which increases the chances for a pregnancy, as well as the cost.    A Clomid cycle usually costs between $100 and about $1200, depending on what is done.  A cycle with injectable gonadotropins usually costs between $1500 and $6000, depending on what is done and the doses of  injectables needed to stimulate follicles to grow.

These women  do not ovulate (release eggs) regularly and therefore have irregular menstrual periods.  The ovaries have many small cysts (2-7 mm diameter) called antral follicles , giving  the ovaries a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts)  appearance on ultrasound.  A relatively new method of treating ovulation problems in women with polycystic ovarian disease is to use an oral medication called metformin (brand name is Glucophage).  Metformin has traditionally been used as an oral drug to help control diabetes. Then, some smart doctor figured out that polycystic ovarian syndrome treatment with metformin can be very effective.  If Glucophage alone does not result in ovulation and pregnancy, we often use:    Clomid and metformin together to induce ovulation   If the combination therapy is not effective, we can try:    Letrozole for induction of ovulation   Or, move on to injectable FSH hormone   Or, in vitro fertilization, IVF for PCOS        Metformin Use with IVF Treatment  We also use Glucophage in women going through in vitro fertilization for PCOS , and for those with very high antral follicle counts -  if their   ovaries are "polycystic" by ultrasound.  We find that some women with polycystic ovaries respond with a "smoother" response to the injectable FSH medication if they have been taking Glucophage.     Risks and Side Effects of Metformin / Glucophage  In about 25% of women Glucophage causes side effects which may include abdominal discomfort, cramping, diarrhea and nausea. The side effects may be severe enough to make the woman stop the Glucophage medication. We are not aware of any serious complications resulting from Glucophage treatment.  Another oral medication used for diabetes called Troglitazone has been associated with liver failure and death in rare cases. This has been publicized on television shows, in newspapers, etc. These problems have not been associated with the use of metformin for polycystic ovarian syndrome.       Treatment Process for Taking Metformin  Laboratory (blood) tests that are sometimes done before starting metformin:  LH, FSH, estradiol, DHEAS, testosterone, 17-OHP, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), kidney function tests (BUN, creatinine) and liver function tests (AST, ALT, and LDH).  Some doctors will do fasting blood sugar and fasting insulin levels in order to calculate a fasting glucose to insulin ratio. This is a measure of insulin resistance, which is present in some women with polycystic ovarian disease.       When to Have Intercourse   Patients need to be counseled regarding possibility of ovulation occurring   and need for regular intercourse (about every 2-3 days) in order to maximize   chances for pregnancy   Women should keep menstrual calendars, recording days of menstrual bleeding and intercourse        Treat polycystic ovarian syndrome with Glucophage / Metformin Alone Metformin Dosing and Protocol  Metformin is taken in a dose that the woman can tolerate. Most people can tolerate 500 mg three times daily, if they build up to that dose gradually.   We start metformin at 500 mg once daily, increase to 500 mg twice a day after one week, then to 500 mg 3 times daily after another week.  If the 3 times daily dose cannot be tolerated due to side effects, we remain on the twice-daily dose.  The most effective dose of Glucophage for PCOS is generally 500mg 3 times daily.      Add Clomiphene to Metformin Treatment Regimen  If the metformin does not result in ovulation and regular periods, the next step is often adding clomiphene to the regimen.   Treatment with Clomid and Metformin Together for PCOS        Other Treatment Options  If the combination of metformin and clomiphene does not result in ovulation then we move on to other options. We usually proceed with one of the following treatments to achieve pregnancy:   Injectable FSH Hormone   for PCOS Treatment   IVF Treatment for PCOS   Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS   Treatment      Weight Loss and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Treatment and Chances for Pregnancy  Some women will have polycystic ovarian syndrome and irregular or absent menstrual periods regardless of their weight. Others develop polycystic ovarian syndrome when they gain too much weight. These women are likely to resume regular ovulation if they can get back down to the weight at which they were previously ovulating.  Although doctors do not consider weight loss a "treatment", it can restore fertility or facilitate infertility treatment by making the body more responsive to fertility medications.   Weight loss improves pregnancy success rates for women with PCOS   Decrease weight to increase the success rate  More about weight and body mass index affecting fertility          Related Articles:   Anovulation  Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, PCOS  PCOS Treatment Options  PCOS Clomid Fertility Treatment            Quick Links   Freeze some eggs to preserve your fertility  Our success rates  IVF cost  IVF money-back guarantees  Money back guarantee plans for frozen donor eggs  Day 5 blastocyst transfer  IVF steps - calendar  Infertility insurance issues / plans          CHICAGO        4920 N.

It is often given to try to induce ovulation in women that do not develop and release an egg (ovulate) on their own  Women who do not ovulate  (without drugs) are said to have a condition called anovulation  The most common cause of anovulation is polycystic ovarian syndrome,  PCOS  This page is about Clomid treatment for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or with irregular menstrual cycles  Clomid for women with regular periods is discussed elsewhere        Related Pages    Polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS     Clomid treatment - general    PCOS treatment options    Injectables for PCOS treatment    Intrauterine insemination    IUI success rates    Clomid and metformin for PCOS    Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS treatment    IVF treatment for PCOS    IVF success rates    IVF pricing plans / guarantees             Ultrasound picture of a polycystic ovary Many small, immature follicles (black circles) are seen  Normal ovary with a  mature follicle (at cursors) 18mm diameter follicle is about ready for ovulation          PCOS and Clomid Treatment - Ovulation and Pregnancy Success Rates   Can I conceive with PCOS?  The chance for pregnancy with fertility treatments for PCOS is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with treatment.   For women under age 35, the question is more about which PCOS treatment will work - and not so much about whether any treatment will work.   Ovulation Success Rates  Women with PCOS will often ovulate after taking Clomid. However, this is variable and some  will not respond to Clomid  at all.   About three fourths of women that are not ovulating  will ovulate on Clomid at some dosing level  Women under 35 with PCOS should have about a 15% chance for pregnancy per month with Clomid treatment (for about 3-4 months) - if they ovulate with Clomid (if sperm and fallopian tubes are normal).   Clomid for PCOS - Pregnancy Success Rates   Only about 50% of women that ovulate with Clomid get pregnant with it  For women with PCOS under age 35 in our in vitro fertilization program the success rate is about 70% for pregnancy with one IVF cycle, and about 60% for live birth (miscarriages account for the different rates).   See our IVF Success Rate Statistics        Clomiphene Citrate Use and PCOS    What is the process for taking Clomid?  Establishing "Day One" of the Menstrual Period   Day one is counted as the first day of menstrual bleeding  The period can be from a spontaneous menstrual period or from a period induced with a progestin medication such as Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate)   Inducing a Period  (if needed)   In order to induce a period, Provera is given for 5 to 10 days at a dose of 5 or 10mg daily  The period usually starts within 2-7 days after the last Provera pill is taken   Starting Clomid   Clomid is started early in the menstrual cycle and is taken for five days either from cycle days 3 through 7, or from day 5 through 9  Clomid is usually started at a dose of one tablet (50mg) daily - taken any time of day   Increasing Clomid Dosage (if needed)   If the patient does not ovulate on the starting dose, Provera is often given to induce a period - then a 100mg dose of Clomid is tried  If she does not ovulate on a 100 mg dose, then 150mg is sometimes tried      Clomid Dosing Recommendations   Clomid works best when the lowest dose that results in ovulation is used   If a woman ovulates on 50mg then increasing to 100mg is probably of no benefit - and may result in increased side effects   Many women will ovulate on 50 or 100mg, and some will require 150 mg in order to get an ovulatory response   Some pregnancies will occur on clomiphene doses above 100mg. However, increasing the Clomid dose to 200mg  results in very few additional pregnancies.      How long does it take to ovulate using Clomid?  For women that do not ovulate on their own, the average day that ovulation occurs is about 8 to 10 days after completing a 5 day course of Clomid.   That means that a woman taking Clomid on days 5-9 will often ovulate on about day 16-20 of the cycle  However, there is significant variation in how long it takes ovulate using Clomid. Some will ovulate much later - as late as two or three weeks after the last clomiphene tablet.        How long should I try Clomid before moving on to other treatment options?   There is no set number of cycles of Clomid that should be done before moving on to other fertility treatments. Several variables are involved in the decision about moving on to more aggressive therapy.  No Ovulation Results After increasing Clomid Dosage   If a woman is not ovulating on a low dose of Clomid, the dose should be increased  If not ovulating at 150 mg then other therapies should be attempted   Female age and Clomid treatment and when to be more aggressive   Relatively fewer cycles should be done with an older female partner  Clomid probably should not be used at all if the female age is 40 or older because of the significantly reduced fertility potential  Women 38 or older should probably start fertility treatment with a fertility specialist - rather than with their gynecologist  If the female is under 38 years old and the sperm is good then usually  3-6 months of Clomid cycles (with good ovulation) are often tried   Personal factors regarding Clomid treatment and when to be more aggressive   The patient's own sense of urgency  Other personal factors, including degree of severity of any Clomid side effects   Financial considerations       Clomid and Treatment Costs  Clomid is not expensive and costs between about $10 and $100 per cycle depending on the dose and whether a brand name or generic clomiphene citrate is used.   The average cost for the Clomid pills for a cycle is about $40  The average cost for generic clomiphene citrate is about $15  Approximate average costs in the US (and  our fees) for various fertility treatments          Quick Links   Freeze some eggs to preserve your fertility  Our success rates  IVF cost  IVF money-back guarantees  Money back guarantee plans for frozen donor eggs  Day 5 blastocyst transfer  IVF steps - calendar  Infertility insurance issues / plans          CHICAGO        4920 N.

I am 26 years old and I was diagnosed with PCOS back in 2000. I had been off birth control since I was 18 and never got pregnant. The doctor always tried to put me on it to help make my period regular and I declined because I wanted kids. I too had a surgery to remove 41 cysts in 2001 and havent had to have another one yet. My periods were never regular. I also tried metaformin still no pregnancy. Then January of this year I got pregnant. Miscarriage rate is 40% for someone with PCOS, but I took metformin that my OB recommended to reduce the risk and I had a health boy this September. I had already adopted children a few years ago, because I had felt there was no hope and it just seemed as thou I would never have my own children, I finally gave up and that is when I got pregnant. My first sign of pregnancy was the sore breasts. So, keep your head up.                 5boyslater    Answered 10/28/07                144 found this helpful     I was recently diagnosed with PCOS. I did not find this out until my husband and I had been trying to conceive for 6 months and were unsuccessful. My periods were very irregular and occurring only every 3 months as well as other symptoms including excessive chin hair, acne, and a high testosterone level. We were fortunately able to conceive with the help of a combination of Provera, Clomid, and Metformin that my OB/GYN prescribed. Due to the irregular periods, Provera induced a period and Clomid and Metformin allowed me to ovulate. We conceived on the very first cycle! I am now 6 weeks pregnant and will continue to take Metformin throughout my first trimester per my OB/GYN to help in the prevention of miscarriage. I was told that by taking Metformin, my risk will be lowered to the same % as any other normal woman during pregnancy. Please don't lose hope. I am living proof that it IS possible!

The only changes that i had mad was cutting caffeen out of my diet, no soda no cofee, i just drank water for four months straight and bam next thing i knew i was pregnant! The stress factor also place a big roll in getting pregnant, girls you just need to relax and enjoy sex dont think about getting pregnant. so more water less caffeen and enjoy sex! but i have a question if anyone can help me with it, we are tryin to have another baby (yeah i know it is soon) but is it going to be just as difficult to have a second child as it was the first? by the way it took 6 years for me to finally conceive.                 CrystalRoyal    Answered 10/11/07               69 found this helpful     I was diagnosed with PCOS in 05' while seeing a fertility specialist. I had had 3 previous pregnancies on my own, without the help of a doctor, in a span of 6 years that all ended up with miscarriage. Finally the doctor I was seeing diagnosed me with PCOS and put me on Metformin, baby asparin, a carb free diet, and fertility shots since I only ovulate a couple of times a year due to PCOS. On the third round, I conceived and she put me on progesteone among the other meds to help me hold the pregnancy. While it was hard, and I almost lost him at 7 weeks and ended up on bedrest almost the whole pregnancy, I am now the proud mother of a very healthy 6 month old baby boy. I am also trying for a another one since I heard that those with fertility problems have an easier time getting pregnant naturally the second time around.

I was diagnosed with PCOS after very irregular periods and anovulatory cycles. I already worked out regularly and was a healthy weight. My husband and I tried for a very long time to conceive and were starting to lose hope. I started taking Metformin 1500mg per day. I found it without Rx (my friend share with me this code * METF4PREG *, you can Google it.) I experienced mild stomach discomfort and no other side effects. The first month, my cycle length was cut in half and the second month, I got pregnant! I never thought the day would come that I would see a positive pregnancy test. I continued the Metformin through my first trimester and we now have a perfect baby boy. Keep your head up and give it a try...I am so thankful that I did!

While it can make conception more difficult, there’s almost always a way to treat a woman with PCOS so she can ovulate normally, conceive, and have a healthy pregnancy. PCOS — short for polycystic ovarian syndrome — is one of the most common causes of female infertility. Because it affects as many as 5 million American women (or about 8 to 10 percent of women of childbearing age), there’s a good chance you or someone you know has it. While this condition can make conceiving more challenging (and it raises the risk of certain pregnancy complications once you do conceive), women with PCOS deliver healthy babies every day. Here’s what you need to know to boost your odds of getting pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy. What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)? Eggs grow in the ovaries inside tiny fluid-filled sacs called follicles. When an egg reaches maturation each month, the follicle containing it breaks open to release it (this process is ovulation ). PCOS interferes with ovulation. Women with PCOS produce higher-than-normal levels of the male hormone testosterone, and those high levels of male hormones get in the way of ovulation, causing women with PCOS to have irregular or absent periods and ovulation. These fluid-filled follicles don’t burst, and instead remain in the ovaries as cysts — thus the name poly (meaning many)-cystic ovarian syndrome. What Causes PCOS? While doctors are not sure about the precise causes of PCOS, the following factors have been linked to the condition: Genetics. PCOS appears to run in families, so if your mom or close female relative has PCOS, your chances of also having it are higher. Excess insulin. Researchers have found that women with PCOS tend to have high levels of insulin (the hormone that regulates how your body breaks down sugar) because their bodies have a hard time using it properly. Insulin also controls ovarian function, and too much insulin in the body can cause irregular or absent ovulation. Being overweight or obese. While overweight women are at greater risk for PCOS and women with PCOS are at greater risk of becoming overweight, the jury is out on whether excess weight causes PCOS or vice versa. Even so, if you're trying to conceive, it’s a good idea to start eating healthy foods and exercising . What Are the Symptoms of PCOS? An irregular period isn’t the only sign of PCOS (and an unpredictable cycle isn’t necessarily a sign that you have PCOS, either). You might also notice acne , excessive hair growth on the face or other parts of the body, weight gain , and occasionally prolonged vaginal bleeding. More than 1 in 2 women with PCOS also develops Type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance) or pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance) before the age of 40. Because many women who don’t have PCOS may also have these symptoms, you’ll want consult your doctor if you have irregular periods or suddenly develop any of the symptoms above. Your practitioner will consider whether you’ve had them in the past and look carefully at your family history. She’ll also examine areas of increased hair growth, conduct blood tests, and perform a pelvic exam or ultrasound to check for ovarian cysts (though it’s totally possible to have PCOS but no cysts). Treating PCOS While PCOS can’t be cured, a healthy lifestyle can help manage your symptoms. Your practitioner can help determine the best treatment for you based on your medical history. A well-balanced diet that’s rich in complex carbs and low in refined carbs and sugar may help restore ovulation and regular periods in women with PCOS. Losing weight can also help treat PCOS. Studies suggest that losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can improve insulin levels, normalize your hormone levels, and regulate your menstrual cycle. (Of course, more weight loss is better if you have more than 5 to 10 percent of your body weight to lose to reach an ideal BMI, so get a personalized weight-loss recommendation from your practitioner.) If you’re not currently trying to conceive (or are done having kids), your practitioner may recommend taking birth control with progesterone to reduce levels of male hormones and regulate your period. Conceiving With PCOS If you’ve been diagnosed with PCOS and are having trouble conceiving, there are number of treatment options for you: Metformin. Although this diabetes medication, which helps regulate the amount of insulin in your blood, isn’t approved by the FDA for treating PCOS, research suggests that it and other diabetes medications may help with fertility, so ask your doctor if it’s right for you. Clomiphene citrate (Clomid). This drug stimulates ovulation and has been a standard infertility treatment for years, including in women with PCOS. Clomid might sometimes be used in conjunction with metformin in helping women with PCOS conceive. Letrozole (Femara). This ovulation inducer is being used more and more often to treat ovulation issues, and can work very well for women with PCOS. Femara can also be used with metformin to help boost the odds for conception success. Hormone shots. If Femara or Clomid, with or without metformin, doesn’t help with conception, injectable fertility drugs can be the next step for women with PCOS. IVF. If none of the above treatments work, in vitro fertilization can help make pregnancy a reality for women with PCOS. Ovarian drilling. In this surgical procedure, the doctor inserts a thin needle through the abdomen (laparoscopically) and cauterizes (burns) small areas of the ovaries to lower the levels of male hormones they produce. The idea behind the procedure is to help improve ovulation, but studies show the results of ovarian drilling are inconsistent and not all practitioners recommend this treatment for PCOS. A 2017 study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found that adequate vitamin D levels could help women with PCOS conceive and have successful, healthy pregnancies. Researchers found that women with PCOS who were vitamin D deficient were 40 percent more likely to have trouble getting pregnant and giving birth to healthy babies than those who weren't vitamin D deficient. And a small 2014 study also found that eating just one teaspoon of cinnamon daily — a spice known to help regulate insulin levels — is a safe and possibly effective way to normalize your cycles and boost your odds of conceiving, too. It can’t hurt to try, so see if sprinkling a spoonful on your morning oatmeal for a few months makes your period more regular. What You Need to Know About PCOS During Pregnancy If you’ve been suffering from PCOS, getting pregnant was likely a hurdle. Once you conceive (congratulations!), it will hopefully be smoother sailing ahead — though you should be aware that moms-to-be with PCOS are more likely to experience certain pregnancy complications. Women with PCOS are three times more likely to miscarry and are more at risk for gestational diabetes , inflammation, prenatal depression , heart disease, high blood pressure , and preeclampsia . Moms-to-be are also more likely to require a C-section , while their babies are more likely to be born preterm and spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Your best bet if you’re expecting with PCOS? Work with your doctor to outline a plan of attack. Gaining the right amount of weight based on your preconception BMI by eating well and staying active is always a good way to reduce your risk of pregnancy complications. Researchers also think the diabetes drug metformin may reduce the chances of having problems while pregnant, since it lowers male hormone levels and can limit weight gain if you’re overweight or obese. More research needs to be done to confirm its safety, but so far the studies that have been done show promising results. Talk to your practitioner about whether it’s an appropriate option for you. PCOS can have an impact on your fertility and your pregnancy, but with the right care and treatment, conception and a healthy pregnancy are completely possible — and probable!

While research has not yet determined how to cure for PCOS, it may be possible for a woman with PCOS to increase her odds of getting pregnant with the right treatment or treatments.  When trying to get pregnant, most women with PCOS will not experience any major problems.  However, for those that do, PCOS can be an extremely frustrating condition.  PCOS can cause a variety of problems, from a delay in conception to higher miscarriage rates to complications with pregnancy.  For some women, the first symptoms of PCOS are that they are having very few or even no periods.  This typically is measured by having less than 9 periods in a twelve month timeframe.  Some women with PCOS will have no period whatsoever.  Some women with polycystic ovarian disease will have regular periods, but may not ovulate every month, or at all.  One of the most popular treatments for infertility in women with polycystic ovaries is Clomid.  Clomid is used to stimulate ovulation.  Clomid will help around 4 out of 5 women ovulate, and can greatly increase a woman’s odds of getting pregnant.  Around 45% of women with PCOS who use Clomid will be able to conceive within four to six cycles.  Clomid does carry an increased risk of having a multiple or twin pregnancy.     If Clomid does not successfully treat infertility, the next step is often to use hormones to try to stimulate the ovaries into producing eggs.  Here again, this treatment, referred to as ovarian stimulation, carries the risk of multiple or twin pregnancy.  There is a surgical procedure that is similar to ovarian stimulation.  Known as Overian drilling, this operation uses the making of several small holes in each ovary with a fine probe or laser.  For some women, this can restore ovulation, or at least make their ovaries more likely to respond to Clomid.  Somewhere around 60% of women with PCOS will experience success with ovarian drilling or ovarian stimulation, and have regular cycles after the treatments, if there are not any additional problems with fertility.  A more radical procedure, IVF or in vitro fertilization, remains an option for a woman who has not responded to other treatments and wants to get pregnant.  The success rates of IVF can vary greatly depending on a variety of individual factors, including the length of infertility, weight, and age.  Getting pregnant with Polycystic Ovaries can be challenging.  However, the methods listed above greatly increase the odds that a woman with polycystic overies has of getting pregnant.
