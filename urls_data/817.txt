Kyler Baughman, who had no known health problems, died just after Christmas. His mother told WPXI News that his organs failed due to septic shock caused by the flu.  Story continues below        READ MORE: 21-year-old aspiring personal trainer dies after flu causes septic shock The case, while rare, isn’t the only flu-related death reported this season. And this year’s flu season in Canada is shaping up to be a nasty one, with experts warning that the peak of the season hasn’t even arrived yet . The predominant strain that is circulating is a “severe one,” Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at University Health Network in Toronto, told Global News. WATCH: Thousands of deaths annually associated with respiratory diseases from flu        But how common are deaths related to the flu? Bogoch says cases such as Baughman’s do occur. “It’s terrible, this is very sad,” Bogoch said, explaining that generally, deaths related to severe cases of influenza occur in the very young or elderly population, or among those who have pre-existing medical conditions. “It’s not common, yet it’s not uncommon for a healthy, young individual to have very bad outcomes.” READ MORE: The flu season in Canada is getting pretty nasty; here is everything you need to know Public Health Agency of Canada’s website states that there are about 12,200 cases of flu-related hospitalizations in Canada each year , and 3,500 deaths. While the illness is at times regarded as something people can push through, it’s more serious than that. The health agency reports that influenza is ranked among the top 10 leading causes of death in the country. And worldwide, the illness claims between 250,000 to 500,000 lives each year. WATCH: Study warns of deadly flu season        There are preemptive measures, such as getting the flu shot and washing your hands more often, that can help lower the chances of contracting the illness. But once you have the flu, here’s what Canadians should know about how to handle it — and when it’s time to get help. Regular flu symptoms vs. severe symptoms “People who have influenza are going to feel really crummy, they are going to have fevers, they might have muscle pains. They’re going to have fatigue,” Bogoch explains, saying these are typical flu symptoms. More severe forms of the flu have the same symptoms, Bogoch notes, but it just feels much worse. READ MORE: Signs you’re too sick and should stay home during the flu season “The things to look for are not new symptoms, but more severe symptoms,” he says. “It’s an intense weakness, and such a low appetite and fatigue that they’re really not able to keep up with their required food intake. That’s a problem because you can get quite sick and quite fast, and you might need to be seen in a medical facility.” Another indication that it’s time to get medical help is difficulty breathing. “It’s not a little bit of shortness of breath, but progressive shortness of breath,” which includes things like actually “huffing and puffing,” Bogoch explains. WATCH: Flu shot could be only 10% effective against predominant strain        Relief for people most at risk Bryna Warshawsky, Ontario Public Health’s medical director for communicable disease, explains that there are ways for those who are most at risk of severe influenza to lower their chances of becoming sick. Influenza anti-viral drugs, such as Tamiflu and Relenza, work to stop the virus from growing, according to Warshawsky. WATCH: Flu season overcrowding ERs throughout Montreal        “The way they work is they stop the virus from growing any more, so if you just have a little virus in you, and you take these, they stop you from getting any sicker than you are.” Warshawsky explains they are most commonly available for elderly people in nursing homes, and those who are admitted to the hospital with the flu. But other at-risk groups such as pregnant women, overweight individuals, and those with underlying medical problems, should consult their doctor about them. “Those are the people who could end up with pneumonia, end up in hospital or end up dying from the flu,” she said. How long should flu last? While it’s different for everyone, typically, flu symptoms should begin to clear up in a couple of days. But Bogoch says a virus will generally run its course, and people will just have to stick it out.

		            November 29, 2011      Facebook 0  Twitter 0  livefyre  Email  Print         Why we get sick and how to stay healthy during cold and flu season.  Here are some commonly asked questions and answers.  Q. Can flying on an airplane make you sick?  A. "Yes," says Bruce Polsky, chief of the division of infectious diseases at St. Luke’s–Roosevelt Hospital Center, in New York City. "Especially if you’re sitting within six feet of someone who is sneezing, coughing, and spewing germs into the dry air."  Because the air is recirculated in the close quarters of the plane’s cabin, certain kinds of germs may stay suspended, and you can end up breathing them in. Drink lots of water, and consider using a saline nasal spray to keep your mucous membranes moist. Q. Can your toothbrush or lipstick reinfect you after you’ve been sick? A. It’s not likely. “If you’ve just come out of a cold, don’t toss it,” says Neil Schachter, a professor of pulmonary and critical care at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City. “Once you’ve had a particular viral illness, you’re protected from it.”  Q. Can you get sick from touching a doorknob? A. Yes. Germs last longer than you think. “Viruses can survive up to three days on surfaces and inanimate objects,” says Chuck Gerba, a professor of environmental microbiology at the University of Arizona in Tucson. That’s why it’s a good idea to carry your own pen. To reduce the number of germs, be sure to zap hot spots (the phone, for instance) regularly at home and at work with a disinfecting product. Q. Can you catch the same cold or flu twice in the same season? A. You can’t get exactly the same one, as your body will have developed antibodies to it. But “cold and flu viruses mutate, so there are subtly different forms of the virus,” says Caroline Rudnick, an assistant professor of community and family medicine at St. Louis University. “Getting one type doesn’t protect you from another.” Even if you’ve had the flu vaccine, if a different strain of the flu virus is going around, you could catch it. Q. Is it safe to exercise with a cold? A. "Do a 'neck check': If your symptoms are in or above your neck―say, if you have a stuffy nose, a headache, and a mildly sore throat and you’re sneezing―it’s fine to work out," Schachter says. "But if your symptoms extend below the neck―if you have a cough, a fever, body aches, or chills―take a break from exercising until you feel better." Q. Can going outside with wet hair in the winter make you sick? A. Exposure to an infection, not cold temperatures, can make you sick. “But if your body gets cold, it could get physically stressed because it’s using a lot of energy to try to stay warm, and you might be more likely to catch an infection,” Rudnick explains. To avoid stressing your body unnecessarily, dry your hair before going out in the cold, or wear a hat.  ________________________________________________________________________________  More From Real Simple:  6 Allergen-Free Snacks for Kids  6 Ways to Have Healthy Holidays  6 Natural Cold-Prevention Strategies ________________________________________________________________________________  What Makes You Vulnerable to Colds and Flus Normally your body’s barriers, including your skin and the linings of your airways and gastrointestinal tract, keep invaders out. But low immunity, contact with a heavy germ load, high stress, and some surprising factors can increase your chances of getting sick.  Having fewer illnesses in childhood could affect your health as an adult. Paradoxically, people who were frequently sick with viral infections as children typically have greater immunity and are susceptible to fewer infections as adults. “Antibodies last a lifetime,” says James A. Wilde, an infectious-disease specialist and the director of the pediatric emergency department at the Medical College of Georgia , in Augusta. When your child is sick with her third cold of the season, remind yourself that it may be helpful to her in the long run.  Cold temperatures and low humidity, indoors and out, can irritate or damage your airways. Air pollution, indoor dust, and ash from fireplaces can also act as irritants, causing inflammation and making it easier for germs to enter your system, says Russell Robertson, chair of the department of family medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, in Chicago .  Smoking can make you prone to bacterial and viral infections. “Smoking damages the linings of the nose and throat, which not only offer barrier protection but also have a coating of fine filaments, called cilia, on the surface,” says Neil Schachter, a professor of pulmonary and critical care at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City. That’s why smokers tend to have more frequent and worse colds than nonsmokers. Exposure to secondhand smoke can also lower your natural defenses.  Stress, lack of sleep, and poor nourishment can also set you up for getting sick. Stress and fatigue can lower your resistance to infection and increase the intensity of illnesses you do get. (For more on how stress can make you sick, see Manage Your Stress.) But there may be a bit of a lag between a stressful event and when you become ill.  “When you’re in a period of maximal stress, you’re releasing a lot of adrenaline, which keeps you going,” says Bruce Polsky, chief of the division of infectious diseases at St. Luke’s–Roosevelt Hospital Center, in New York City. “Once that stressful stimulus is over or removed, you crash.”  If you’re under long-term stress, you’re especially susceptible to illness, because chronically elevated stress hormones can suppress immune function and lower the activity of germ-fighting white blood cells. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that severe chronic stress―from such things as conflicts with family or friends and unemployment―significantly increases a person’s risk of coming down with a cold.  How to Stay Healthy During Cold and Flu Season Strengthen your body’s defenses by eating well, drinking lots of water, exercising regularly, and staying away from people who appear sick. If you do get a bug, pamper yourself. Eat antioxidant-rich foods, such as whole-grain cereals, walnuts, and artichokes, as well as foods packed with omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon. “The antioxidants protect the body’s tissues against stress and inflammation and enhance immune function,” says Cindy Moore, a registered dietitian and the director of nutrition therapy at the Cleveland Clinic. “Omega-3 fatty acids promote blood flow and the production of anti-inflammatory substances,” which also boost immune function.  Take a brisk walk every day. Any kind of moderate daily exercise―such as cycling, swimming, or working out at the gym―can improve lung and immune function. Physical activity enhances the ability of T lymphocytes (white blood cells that attack virus and cancer cells) to ramp up the immune response, says Neil Schachter, a professor of pulmonary and critical care at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City. But don’t push yourself too hard. Some studies suggest that high-intensity exercise for two or more hours at a time increases stress hormones, which can lead to suppression of the immune system.  Stay three or more feet away from people who are coughing or sneezing. This will keep you outside the immediate spray of their germs, says Chuck Gerba, a professor of environmental microbiology at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. If you’re not near a sink during the day or you work in a high-germ environment, such as a school, carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you.  As you’ve been told millions of times, drink lots of water, don’t skimp on sleep, and get a flu shot. The tried-and-true advice still holds. Staying well hydrated keeps the tissues of the respiratory system moist and helps the immune system work properly. Sleep helps the body function at an optimum level. If you get seven to eight hours of rest a night, you’ll be less likely to become sick, and if you do catch something, you’ll recover faster. October through November is the best time to be immunized, even if you’re a healthy adult. If you can’t stand needles, ask your doctor about FluMist, a prescription nasal-spray vaccine that’s as effective as a shot.  Finally, stay home from work when you first feel ill. It’s possible that work-related stress (not to mention commuting) could slow your recovery. Tell your boss that Real Simple said so.  Click here to read more cold and flu stories.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED What makes flu outbreak an 'epidemic'? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What makes flu outbreak an 'epidemic'?  03:02 Story highlights The type of flu going around is called Influenza A (H3N2) The flu kills about 36,000 people a year in the United States, according to the CDC People with medical conditions and weakened immune systems are most at risk An early and severe start to the flu season has many health experts concerned. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 47 states are experiencing widespread activity, although it appears to be decreasing in some areas. According to the CDC, this is the most flu cases they've seen at this time of year in more than a decade. Twenty pediatric flu-related deaths have occurred since the start of the season. The CDC does not track adult flu-related deaths. The peak of the season, which usually happens in February, may be yet to come for most states -- officials said Friday it may be a week or two before it becomes clear whether cases have peaked. Here are some common flu questions from readers answered: Why is this year's flu causing more severe cases? The type of flu that is going around is called Influenza A (H3N2), which is often linked to more serious diseases than other flu varieties, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told CNN. People could get more complications from this particular strain, which would make them sick for a longer period of time. How is this flu season different than last year's? The 2011-2012 flu season began late and was relatively mild compared with previous seasons, according to the CDC . In fact, the season's peak set a record for the lowest and shortest since surveillance began. The number of pediatric flu-related deaths was also low last year. The CDC reported 26 children under the age of 18 had died by May 25, 2012. As a comparison, 122 pediatric flu-related deaths were reported during the 2010-2011 season.

MUST WATCH Flu epidemic sweeps country  03:15 How many people usually die from the flu each year? The flu kills about 36,000 people a year in the United States, according to the CDC, though the range varies greatly each year. Most deaths are caused by complications from the flu. Children under 2 years old, adults over 65, pregnant women and American Indians are at a greater risk of suffering from flu complications, according to the CDC. People with medical conditions like asthma, lung disease, heart disease and people with weakened immune systems are also at risk. How does someone go from having the flu to dying? Most of the people who die have underlying illnesses or a weakened immune system, says Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. The flu can weaken the immune system even more, which can lead to a complication like a bacterial infection. "It is that bacterial infection that most often causes death, especially in the younger population," Gupta says. So if I get the flu, should I go to the emergency room? Most people with the flu don't have to -- they'll recover on their own in five to seven days with plenty of rest and fluids, says Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. However, you should go to the ER immediately if: -- You have difficulty breathing or have pain in your chest -- You can't keep fluids down because of nausea and vomiting -- Your fever or cough gets better, then worsens "Let's say you have the flu, you get better, you think everything is all clear," Gupta says. "Then a couple days later, the fever comes back. That means you may now have a bacterial infection." Does this mean the flu vaccine isn't working? The flu vaccine is only about 60% effective , according to the CDC. How well the vaccine works can vary based on your age and health, as well as how good the "match" of the vaccine is to this year's flu strain. Each year, the vaccine is made from three strains of the influenza virus that researchers suspect will be the most active. So far, according to the CDC, this year's vaccine matches well with the most predominant type of flu spreading in the United States, but is less well matched to the No. 2 type of virus. The vaccine usually works best in young, healthy people, according to Dr. Bill Schaffner, chairman of the preventative medicine department at Vanderbilt University. But even if you do get the flu, the vaccine can protect against harsher complications. Learn more about the flu vaccine's effectiveness Will the flu vaccine make me sick? The virus used in the flu shot is a dead virus, Gupta says. "You cannot get the flu from a flu shot." But your body's immune system will react, and that can make you feel pain in your arm or feel less than 100% for a few days. Is there a flu vaccine shortage? While CNN has heard reports of vaccine shortages in some areas, manufacturers say there are vaccines available for anyone who wants to get a flu shot. There was a temporary delay in new shipments of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu due to an increased demand, according to a spokeswoman. Tamiflu can help reduce the severity and length of flu symptoms if taken early. Learn more about the reported shortages I'm sold! Is it too late to get the vaccine? In one word: no. Keep in mind that it takes about two weeks for antibodies to develop in your body and provide protection against the virus, the CDC says. Opinion: Next time, get the vaccine early  How can I avoid getting the flu in the first place? It's disturbing to think about, but flu germs can spread up to 6 feet through coughs and sneezes. They can also live on surfaces for up to eight hours. Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician and mother of two, recommends practicing good "social distancing." This means canceling parties or dates if someone is sick and avoiding large crowds (like at the movies or going out to dinner) if your community has been hit hard by the virus. It's also a good idea to practice proper hand-washing -- for at least 20 seconds several times a day. And wiping handles, counters and remotes daily with hot soapy water or disinfectant will kill any germs that linger.

Influenza, commonly called the flu, is not the same as stomach "flu" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.  For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. People at higher risk of developing flu complications include:   Young children under 5, and especially those under 2 years  Adults older than 65  Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities  Pregnant women and women up to two weeks postpartum  People with weakened immune systems  People who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes  People who are very obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher   Your best defense against influenza is to receive an annual vaccination.      Symptoms Initially, the flu may seem like a common cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. But colds usually develop slowly, whereas the flu tends to come on suddenly. And although a cold can be a nuisance, you usually feel much worse with the flu.  Common signs and symptoms of the flu include:   Fever over 100.4 F (38 C)  Aching muscles, especially in your back, arms and legs  Chills and sweats  Headache  Dry, persistent cough  Fatigue and weakness  Nasal congestion  Sore throat   When to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can treat themselves at home and often don't need to see a doctor.  If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your doctor right away. Taking antiviral drugs within the first 48 hours after you first notice symptoms may reduce the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.

You can inhale the droplets directly, or you can pick up the germs from an object — such as a telephone or computer keyboard — and then transfer them to your eyes, nose or mouth.  People with the virus are likely contagious from the day or so before symptoms first appear until about five days after symptoms begin, though sometimes people are contagious for as long as 10 days after symptoms appear. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.  Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing regularly. If you've had influenza in the past, your body has already made antibodies to fight that particular strain of the virus. If future influenza viruses are similar to those you've encountered before, either by having the disease or by vaccination, those antibodies may prevent infection or lessen its severity.  But antibodies against flu viruses you've encountered in the past can't protect you from new influenza subtypes that can be very different immunologically from what you had before.  Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of developing influenza or its complications include:   Age. Seasonal influenza tends to target young children and older adults.  Living or working conditions. People who live or work in facilities along with many other residents, such as nursing homes or military barracks, are more likely to develop influenza.  Weakened immune system. Cancer treatments, anti-rejection drugs, corticosteroids and HIV/AIDS can weaken your immune system. This can make it easier for you to catch influenza and may also increase your risk of developing complications.  Chronic illnesses. Chronic conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or heart problems, may increase your risk of influenza complications.  Pregnancy. Pregnant women are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Women who are two weeks postpartum are also more likely to develop influenza-related complications.  Obesity. People with a BMI of 40 or more have an increased risk of complications from the flu.   Complications If you're young and healthy, seasonal influenza usually isn't serious. Although you may feel miserable while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects. But high-risk children and adults may develop complications such as:   Pneumonia  Bronchitis  Asthma flare-ups  Heart problems  Ear infections   Pneumonia is the most serious complication. For older adults and people with a chronic illness, pneumonia can be deadly.  Prevention The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone over the age of 6 months.  Each year's seasonal flu vaccine contains protection from the three or four influenza viruses that are expected to be the most common during that year's flu season. The vaccine is currently available as an injection only. The CDC no longer recommends nasal spray flu vaccinations because during recent flu seasons, the spray has been relatively ineffective.  Controlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100 percent effective, so it's also important to take measures such as these to reduce the spread of infection:   Wash your hands. Thorough and frequent hand-washing is an effective way to prevent many common infections. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers if soap and water aren't readily available.  Contain your coughs and sneezes. Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. To avoid contaminating your hands, cough or sneeze into a tissue or into the inner crook of your elbow.  Avoid crowds. Flu spreads easily wherever people congregate — in child care centers, schools, office buildings, auditoriums and public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you reduce your chances of infection. And, if you're sick, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever subsides so that you lessen your chance of infecting others.

Most people–young and old–who get sick recover. Find out what makes a person more at risk for serious complications.     Sarah Klein  January 24, 2018       By all accounts, it’s been a pretty terrible flu season . There’s widespread flu activity across the country, a vaccine that’s not all that effective, and an onslaught of news stories of flu-related deaths.  Adults and children who otherwise seemed healthy are dying from the flu shortly after developing symptoms, according to accounts from their families. Michael Messenger , 12, died just days after a rapid flu test at an urgent care center came back negative. Katharine Gallagher , 27, died five days after leaving work early with flu symptoms, which progressed to severe acute bronchial pneumonia. It’s all more than a little frightening.  But what are your actual chances of dying from the flu—and how does it even happen? Health spoke to Pat Salber, MD , a former emergency room physician based in San Francisco and the founder of the blog The Doctor Weighs In to get answers.      What are the chances of dying from the flu?  The number of people who get sick with the flu, require hospitalization, or ultimately die from the virus changes annually depending on several factors, including which strain of the virus is dominant and the strength of that year's vaccine. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 12,000 and 56,000 flu-related deaths occur each year.  That's still a relatively small number, considering that the number of flu cases in a given year can clock in at up to 60.8 million, according to the CDC. “In some of these pandemics, millions of people get infected, so death is relatively uncommon,” Dr. Salber says.  RELATED: 20 Surprising Ways to Prevent Colds and Flu  How does someone die from the flu?  Some victims may contract a second infection while already battling the flu, like pneumonia (an infection of the air sacs of the lungs), which can be severe enough to lead to organ failure and ultimately death, Dr. Salber says. The flu can be further complicated by sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to an infection that happens when bacteria have entered the bloodstream.    Other people may die from the flu because their immune systems are already compromised by another illness. “Getting the flu can exacerbate conditions like diabetes, asthma, and chronic lung disease,” Dr. Salber explains. “If someone with diabetes has mild renal failure, gets the flu, doesn’t keep up with hydration—which makes renal function worse—and can’t fight off the flu infection as well because they already have a lowered immune response, they can start to spiral out of control.”  But even healthy people can die of the flu, as news reports of deaths among children often suggest. “Young kids who look really healthy may be getting overwhelmed by their own immune response,” Dr. Salber says. In some cases, the body may increase immune defenses so much that infection-fighting proteins build up in the blood and damage other organs. “For example, you can get this immune response in the lungs,” she says, which in turn makes it hard to breathe. “Kids complaining of shortness of breath is not regular with the flu.”      Who is most at risk of dying?  Older adults and young kids are most at risk for serious complications of the flu, including hospitalization and death. Older folks are more likely to have weakened immune systems to begin with due to underlying health concerns, and they're also more prone to developing a secondary infection, Dr. Salber says. Kids may be more likely to have an overwhelming immune system response simply because they may not have had previous exposure to a particularly aggressive strain of the flu.  “We know that H3N2 seems to be causing all the problems this year, and it hasn’t been around for a number of years,” she says. “Kids who were born after the last time H3N2 was the dominant strain won’t have pre-formed antibodies, so the virus can spread more rapidly.”      Everyone has a different immune system, and the way an individual responds to the flu varies. Although our understanding of the flu has come a long way, “there are still lots of unknowns, unfortunately,” she says.  RELATED: 11 Signs It’s More Serious Than the Common Cold  How can someone with the flu stay safe?  This is not the time to play the hero. “Have a low threshold for when to contact a health care professional,” Dr. Salber says, especially if you feel like you're the sickest you’ve ever been or you have severe, out-of-the-ordinary symptoms, such as shortness of breath.  “Most illnesses start out mild, you get sicker, and then you start getting better,” she explains. “If you’re getting sicker and sicker, don’t wait it out.” A doctor may decide to give you an antiviral treatment like Tamiflu or Relenza, or diagnosis and treat a secondary bacterial infection with antibiotics. Follow Mom’s advice too: Get plenty of rest, and stay hydrated to give your body the best shot at beating the flu safely and quickly.      To get our top stories delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter  What's the best way to avoid the flu in the first place?  Getting your flu shot is still the best way to protect yourself against the flu—yes, even if it's late in flu season. “We know the flu vaccine is likely to be less effective this year, but it still has some protection,” Dr. Salber says. It’s better than nothing, and it helps protect the most vulnerable among us.  “Young healthy people might say, ‘I can gut it out,’ but if you go visit Grandma, [and give her the flu], maybe she can’t gut it out. Get your flu shot not to just protect yourself, but your loved ones.” Wash your hands regularly too, she adds, and don’t feel bad politely bowing out of a handshake. Your life, or someone else's, may be at stake.

By  Lisa Ryan @lisarya   Share      Share      Tweet      Pin It     xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?     Created with Sketch.                  Comment                 The 2018 flu season is particularly dangerous.   Photo: FPG/Getty Images      While you might typically think of the flu as a mere annoyance (or a great excuse to skip work and binge old episodes of Gossip Girl all day long), this year’s flu season is actually quite dangerous. It seems like you can’t turn on the news or scroll through social media without reading about yet another tragic flu-related death , and, chances are, everyone you know has already been bed-ridden because of this year’s strain.  To figure out why the 2018 flu season is so deadly, the Cut spoke with Kristen Nordlund, press officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Uh … what exactly is going on with this year’s flu strain? ﻿Each year, there are usually a few different strains of the flu virus circulating around. But in 2018, we’re seeing more of the Influenza A-H3N2 than any other strain, Nordlund said. And any year in which this is the dominant strain tends to be worse than usual — just like during the horrible 2014-15 season, which saw an estimated 34 million people come down with the flu. “We know in general those seasons tend to be more severe especially for older adults and young children,” Nordlund said.    What is it about this year that’s so particularly bad, though? Given that the H3N2 strain has been dominant in previous years, you’re likely wondering why everyone’s in such a panic about this particular season. Well, according to Nordlund, it’s because of the timing of it all — and just how widespread the dang thing has been. “In previous seasons it tends to happen in different parts of the United States at different times,” she said. “This is one of the first years we’ve really seen that widespread activity is everywhere. Flu is really across the board in every state at the same time.”      Nordlund went on to explain that although each flu season is different, sometimes you don’t really see much activity until January. But this year, flu season started in November, meaning that it was happening right when everyone was being social over the holidays, potentially helping it spread. “The timing of it lined up with some of those large gatherings,” she added.  Yikes. So, how many people have actually died this year? No one really knows! Nordlund told the Cut that there have already been 37 recorded influenza-related deaths in kids under the age of 18 so far this year. “That is higher than we saw at this time last year but somewhat comparable to the 2014-15 season,” she said. The CDC expert explained that it’s tough to track the precise number of how many people actually die from the flu each year — there are usually way more flu-associated deaths than actually end up listed on death certificates. So overall, the CDC estimates that anywhere from 12,000 to 56,000 people could die from the virus in any given year.    Oh, God. Well, when will this thing be over? When exactly this year’s flu season will end is yet another thing no one really knows. Nordlund told the Cut in late January that we hadn’t seen the peak of this flu season yet (so its activity is not even starting to decline at this point), and we won’t know how many people have died from the flu until it’s actually over. “Flu activity overall tends to peter out as it gets warmer,” she told the Cut. “So we know because of how high activity is that it’s likely we’re going to see many more weeks of flu activity, but how many more — we don’t know.”  Greaaattt. Is there anything we can do to protect ourselves? Sure. This year’s flu may be horrible, but you still have time to get a flu shot, according to Nordlund. And of course, there’s also the basic preventive actions, like washing your hands, staying home if you’re sick, and covering your cough or sneezes. But just a warning: If you already got the flu this year, that doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed to not get it again before the season is over. “You can get the flu twice in one season because you can get a different strain,” Nordlund cautioned.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED How the flu can turn deadly Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How the flu can turn deadly  01:39 Story highlights Flu commonly kills the elderly by leading to pneumonia, but can prove lethal in other ways Children, especially those under age 5, are at higher risk than healthy adults for flu-related complications (CNN) This flu season is fierce and has already claimed the lives of at least 37 children in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 11,965 laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations reported from October 1 to January 20. The number of people infected with influenza is believed to be much higher because not everyone goes to their doctor when they are sick, nor do doctors test every patient. Added to those scary stats, the World Health Organization estimates that annual flu epidemics result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness globally and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths. Fierce, deadly flu season still not peaked, CDC says Although the fever and aches may feel terrible, most of us don't die from the flu. So how exactly does this common illness lead to so many dying? "Influenza and its complications disproportionately affect people who are 65 and older. They account for 80% of the deaths," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. Read More But young children and people who have an underlying illness, such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, are susceptible to dying from the flu as well, he said. There are three ways adults can succumb: Pneumonia What is pneumonia? "The usual flu death is a person who gets influenza, gets all that inflammation in their chest, and then has the complication of pneumonia," explained Schaffner, who added that this is a "long, drawn-out process." Pneumonia is an infection that causes the small air sacs of the lungs to fill with fluid or pus. Though this is the most common route to death, flu can be fatal for more unusual reasons. Sepsis How my daughter died from a simple case of flu "Much of the systemic symptoms that any of us have with influenza -- the fever, the aches and pains, the sense of exhaustion -- all of those are part of (our body's) response to the virus," said Schaffner. The symptoms we experience are an inflammatory response to the immune system "soldiers" that our body sends to fight any pathogen, he said. "Pushing the war analogy, we all know there is incidental damage that occurs during the course of a war," said Schaffner, and so the flu can also take a perfectly healthy person "and put them in the ER in 24 to 48 hours." Flu stimulates an immune response in everyone's body, but for some people, this natural response can be "overwhelming," noted Schaffner. "Young robust people can have such an overwhelming response that it's called a cytokine storm." Cytokines -- proteins that are created as part of the inflammatory response -- create a "storm" in the body, explained Schaffner: "And this cytokine storm can actually lead to sepsis in the person." What is sepsis? Kyler Baughman, 21 , is one example of that happening. He died unexpectedly in December at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh after a bout with the flu. Baughman, a college student, worked two jobs and often posted pictures of himself at the gym on social media. The cause of his death, as reported by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner, was influenza, septic shock and multiple organ failure. Heart attack Chances of a heart attack are increased sixfold during the first seven days after a flu infection, a new study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found. The study looked at nearly 20,000 cases of flu in Ontario adults age 35 or older. What are heart failure, heart attack and cardiac arrest? The risk may be higher for older adults, said Dr. Jeff Kwong, lead author of the study and a scientist at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences and Public Health Ontario. Heart attack occurs when blood flow to the heart is abruptly cut off; this is also called acute myocardial infarction. Since a few days usually elapse between getting sick and getting a lab test, Kwong said "the increased risk is probably within the first 10 days or so after exposure to the virus." The research, which identified 364 hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction among the flu cases studied, also showed a stronger association for influenza B than influenza A. "We would have needed more cases to determine if the difference was real or just a chance finding," said Kwong. Though the new study did not identify the reasons why flu might lead to heart attack, Kwong and his co-authors theorize that infectious illness may cause inflammation, stress and constriction of blood vessels, which increases blood pressure. Threats to children The overwhelming majority -- 99% -- of children under age 5 who die from flu-related illness are in developing countries . Children in the developed world may not face such high risks, but they are still vulnerable if they develop flu. Sepsis resulting from flu can cause the death of very young children, said Dr. Flor M. Munoz, an associate professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. 5 ways to protect your child in flu season "Children have different risks depending on their age," said Munoz, and the most worrisome ages are "infants in the first year of life and those under 5 years of age." "What's different from adults is children have a lot of opportunities to not only be exposed to flu but also to spread the flu," said Munoz. In general, children are the first to get sick when flu season begins, mainly because they are in school and playing with others -- and spreading germs. "They can be completely healthy and still have problems with the flu," said Munoz. "The flu shot doesn't offer the same protection as it does for adults." Flu widespread throughout the nation, 30 children dead This is due to the lack of "immunologic experience" that children have. The immune system in infants is "still developing and it has different responses, let's say, to new things," said Munoz. "Young children will not necessarily have the same response that older children, adolescents or adults have." The same is true for very old people, said Munoz: "That's just a normal way the immune system works." However, the worry whenever a young child or infant gets flu symptoms, including fever, is that they might have a more serious infection occurring at the same time. "Young children at that age can have meningitis, pneumonia, bacterial infections, not necessarily flu-related," said Munoz. "One needs to be more cautious." Could this be a better way to build a flu vaccine? "Certainly, we do tend to see secondary infections," said Munoz. So a child will start with the flu and the irritation in their noses and throats leave them exposed to more germs and so they develop another bacterial infection --- ear infections, say, or sinusitis or pneumonia. With the child's immune system already fighting the flu and then another bacteria on top of that, sepsis may be the result. These are the cases we hear on the news, said Munoz, "previously healthy children that don't feel well and in a day or two they die of some complication." Another threat? Though children and adults experience the same symptoms when sick with the flu, children are more likely to get diarrhea and to vomit. This can lead to dehydration in infants and small children, Munoz said, and it can be life-threatening at such a young age. What do parents need to know? "Every year we're going to have the flu. Every year we have anywhere between 50 and 100 deaths of children from the flu," said Munoz, who is also a member of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics. "This is something to be taken seriously." How to recover from the flu Parents can make sure their children are vaccinated, she said. "As a mother, if you have something at hand that can protect your child, why not?" "It's a very safe vaccine -- it is not true that you can get the flu with the vaccine," she added. Lynnette Brammer, head of the CDC's Domestic Flu Surveillance team, supported Munoz' view. "We want to continue to emphasize that there's still a lot of flu activity to come, people that haven't been vaccinated should still get vaccine," said Brammer. "We may be getting close to the peak of this wave, it's not unusual to have a second wave of influenza B come through."

The flu shot is admittedly imperfect, Schaffner said, but there are still benefits. "If you get the vaccine and you have a flu-like illness, it's likely the illness is less severe," he said. "Data show you're less likely to get pneumonia and less likely to die." If a child, especially a small one, becomes sick, parents should visit a doctor or health care provider who may prescribe medication, said Munoz. By treating illness, antiviral drugs become a second line of defense against serious consequences. While most otherwise healthy people will not need to be prescribed antiviral drugs, those who may benefit from these medications are "people who are high risk, the elderly, children under 2, pregnant women and people with chronic health problems," said Brammer. Antiviral drugs are known to work best when started within two days of getting sick. Studies show these drugs, which rarely produce side effects , can lessen symptoms and shorten the time a person is sick by one or two days. "It's a brisk influenza season and I think it will end up being a moderately severe one," said Schaffner. "We'll take any bit of protection and prevention we can get."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday reported 42 states had heavy flu-related patient traffic last week, up from 39 the week before. (Feb. 2) AP Lab technologist Sharda Modi tests a patient's swab for a flu infection at Upson Regional Medical Center in Thomaston, Ga., on Friday, Feb. 9, 2018.

(Photo: David Goldman, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 37 COMMENT EMAIL MORE INDIANAPOLIS — As far as flu seasons go, experts are saying the levels of visits to hospitals and emergency rooms for this one are comparable to the 2009 swine flu. As such, reports of otherwise healthy or young people dying from the infection are flying around. The stories have been shocking, especially because many of these people were outside the high-risk groups for flu-related death that include pregnant women, small children and the elderly. So far in the 2017-2018 season, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 63 pediatric deaths. This compares to 110 deaths in 2016-2017, 93 in 2015-2016 and 148 in 2014-2015. Feb. 9: This flu season is the worst in nearly a decade — and it's not getting better Feb. 7: Televangelist Gloria Copeland says you don't need flu shot if you have Jesus The CDC does not know how many deaths are caused overall from the seasonal flu because, among other reasons, flu-related deaths happen a few weeks after someone is infected and are often caused by a secondary illness or a pre-existing condition. From the 2010-2011 to the 2013-2014 seasons, the CDC gives a range of 12,000 (during the 2011-2012 season) to 56,000 (2012-2013) deaths. Here are some reasons why otherwise healthy people can die from the flu. Pneumonia The infection causes inflammation in your lungs and can attack just after the flu. Harmful bacteria already in your body, or that enters while your immune system is fighting the flu, can multiply when your system is compromised. Pneumonia can come on when you're just starting to feel better a few days after the flu has struck, according to Popular Science . WebMD outlines symptoms including chills, fever, chest pains, sweating, a cough producing green or bloody mucus, and bluish lips or nails caused from an inadequate amount of oxygen. Especially if you experience a high fever or it's difficult to breathe, call your doctor or visit a hospital. Depending on the type of pneumonia you have, antibiotics could help. Heart attack A January article in the New England Journal of Medicine found a "significant association" between respiratory infections, including the flu, and acute myocardial infarction — the medical term for a heart attack. The authors found that people were six times more likely to have a heart attack during the first seven days after being diagnosed with the flu than in the year before and after it. Feb. 5: Got the flu? Here's what works to lessen the misery Feb. 5: Pink sang the national anthem with the flu. How to know when symptoms are serious Inflammation and the stress the flu puts on your body can lead to a greater risk of blood clots near your heart, study author Dr. Jeff Kwong told NPR . Most of those who had heart attacks the week they had the flu tended to be older and had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other conditions associated with heart disease, Kwong said. Sepsis Infections in your lungs, kidneys, skin and gut can trigger sepsis. As your body releases chemicals into the bloodstream to fight infections, your immune system can go too far and cause inflammation in — and damage — several organs. Sepsis can take hold after pneumonia that occurs after the flu, according to the Sepsis Alliance . The CDC calls sepsis life-threatening and highlights that without treatment, it can result in damaged tissues, failed organs and death. According to WebMD , symptoms include rapid breathing, confusion, fever and chills, low body temperature, urinating less than usual and diarrhea. Catching it in the early stages is key to treatment and survival. CLOSE If you don't want to catch the sniffles, here are four ways to travel without getting the bug. USA TODAY Wondering if you have the flu? Here's more basic information Question: What are the symptoms of the flu? Answer: The CDC lists the following: fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting. If these symptoms are somewhat mild, the CDC suggests staying home to avoid spreading germs. High-risk groups include young kids, people age 65 and over, pregnant women and those with chronic lung disease, heart disease, asthma, kidney disorders and those on chronic steroids. Q: How long are you contagious? A: You can spread the flu from the day before you exhibit any symptoms until about seven days after. So stay home during this time unless you're seeking medical treatment. You can get the flu by breathing in droplets that infected people have sneezed or coughed into the air or by touching your face after touching an infected surface. Feb. 2: The nasty flu season could cost U.S. businesses $15B in lost productivity Feb. 2: Child death toll in flu season hits 53 as hospitalizations soar Q: Does the flu vaccine work? A: Those who have been vaccinated lessen their risk of contracting influenza B and influenza A (H1N1) the most, according to the CDC. The most common strain so far this year is A (H3N2). The CDC said the vaccine offers less protection against this one because H3N2 is more likely to have changed than other strains since the vaccine was formulated. The vaccine is about 30% effective against H3N2, according to the CDC. Experts strongly recommend that everyone over the age of six months be vaccinated. Q: Is it too late to get a flu shot? A: No. The flu season can last from October until May. It takes about two weeks for the shot to take hold. Even those who are allergic to eggs should get the shot this year, said Dr. Christopher Belcher, medical director of infection control for St. Vincent Health. The egg protein in the vaccine isn't enough to set off allergic reactions in most people.

Chances are good that some of the advice friends and family gave you about avoiding or dealing with the flu was wrong. There seems to be no shortage of misinformation and bad advice when it comes to dealing with the flu.  Here are 10 common myths about the flu.    MYTH: You can catch the flu from the vaccine. The vaccine is made from an inactivated virus that can't transmit infection. So people who get sick after receiving a flu vaccination were going to get sick anyway. It takes a week or two to get protection from the vaccine. But people assume that because they got sick after getting the vaccine, the shot caused their illness.    MYTH: Healthy people don't need to be vaccinated. While it's especially important for people who have a chronic illness to get the flu shot, anyone — even healthy folks — can benefit from being vaccinated. Current CDC guidelines recommend yearly vaccination against influenza for everyone older than 6 months of age, including pregnant women.    MYTH: Getting the flu vaccination is all you need to do to protect yourself from the flu. There are a number of steps you can take to protect yourself during flu season besides vaccination. Avoid contact with people who have the flu, wash your hands frequently, and consider taking anti-viral medications if you were exposed to the flu before being vaccinated.    MYTH: The flu is just a bad cold. Influenza may cause bad cold symptoms, like sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, and cough. But in the United States alone, 36,000 people die and more than 200,000 are hospitalized each year because of the flu. During the 2017/18 flu season, flu activity has significantly increased throughout the majority of the country with the A(H3N2) viruses predominating so far, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). A(H3N2) virus-predominant influenza seasons have been associated with more hospitalizations and deaths in people age 65 years and older as well as young children. It's not too late to get a flu shot. Even if it doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it can decrease the chance of severe symptoms.    MYTH: You can't spread the flu if you're feeling well. Actually, 20% to 30% of people carrying the influenza virus have no symptoms.    MYTH: You don't need to get a flu shot every year. The influenza virus changes (mutates) each year. So getting vaccinated each year is important to make sure you have immunity to the strains most likely to cause an outbreak.    MYTH: You can catch the flu from going out in cold weather without a coat, with wet hair or by sitting near a drafty window. The only way to catch the flu is by being exposed to the influenza virus. Flu season coincides with the cold weather. So people often associate the flu with a cold, drafty environment. But, they are not related.    MYTH: Feed a cold, starve a fever. If you have the flu (or a cold) and a fever, you need more fluids. There's little reason to increase or decrease how much you eat. Though you may have no appetite, "starving" yourself will accomplish little. And poor nutrition will not help you get better.    MYTH: Chicken soup will speed your recovery from the flu. Hot liquids can soothe a sore throat and provide much needed fluids. But chicken soup has no other specific qualities that can help fight the flu.    MYTH: If you have a high fever with the flu that lasts more than a day or two, antibiotics may be necessary. Antibiotics work well against bacteria, but they aren't effective for a viral infection like the flu. Then again, some people develop a bacterial infection as a complication of the flu, so it may be a good idea to get checked out if your symptoms drag on or worsen .    The flu is a good example of how medical myths can get in the way of good medical care. When it's flu season, take the necessary steps to stay healthy. That includes separating fact from myth.

Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     The United States is in the midst of a deadly flu season . The latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that 37 children have died so far this flu season, which began in October. The flu is currently widespread in 49 states, and doctors across the country continue to see more cases, more hospitalizations, and more deaths from influenza infections. Over the past several weeks, deaths of Americans of all ages from the flu have made headlines. The family of 12-year-old Dylan Winnick, who died from the flu in Florida last week, said they were stunned by how quickly the virus took his life. "No indications. No warnings. Just common cold. That's what's so scary about it," his stepfather Mike Medwin said. Two young mothers – Tandy Harmon of Gersham, Oregon, and Karlie Illg Slaven of Hendricks County, Indiana – also died of the flu last week. Their families said they were healthy until the sudden illness struck. While flu is most dangerous for adults over the age of 65 and children under the age of 5, it can turn deadly for anyone. The number of flu-related deaths varies widely from year to year, but even during a relatively mild flu season the illness claims thousands of lives. The CDC reports that over a three-decade period starting in the mid-1970s, the number of flu deaths in the U.S. ranged from a low of about 3,000 a year to as many as 49,000 in a bad year. How does the flu lead to death? While it is possible for the flu itself to cause death due to serious breathing problems and severe dehydration, according to Dr. Claire Bocchini, an infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital, it is more likely that a complication from the infection will be the cause of a flu-related fatality. The most common complication from the flu that can lead to death is a bacterial infection of the lungs, or bacterial pneumonia. "This happens because the flu virus injures the lungs and causes inflammation that then makes it easier for bacteria to invade the lungs and cause a very serious infection," Bocchini told CBS News. "The bacterial infection can make it hard for children to breathe, and their lungs struggle to get enough oxygen for their body." Sepsis is another complication that can lead to death. It occurs when the body overreacts to an infection. Sepsis can affect multiple organ systems, sometimes causing organ failure and resulting in death. Other rare complications from the flu that can be fatal include infection of the heart (or myocarditis) which can cause sudden death or heart failure, and infection of the brain (or encephalitis) which can lead to seizures and dangerous swelling of the brain.     Who is most at risk? Children under the age of 5, and especially those younger than 2, as well as people who are 65 and older are more likely to develop complications from flu. Also in the higher-risk group are pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, and neurologic conditions. How can you protect yourself? The best defense against the flu is to get the flu vaccine . The CDC recommends everyone age 6 months and older get a flu shot each year. "The flu vaccine is a very safe vaccine that saves lives," Bocchini said. "Studies have shown that of the children who died from the flu in the U.S. last year, 85 percent were not immunized." Although the flu vaccine doesn't guarantee that you won't get sick, doctors say it does reduce the chances, and if you do get sick it may be less severe. If you develop flu-like symptoms , such as fever, body aches and fatigue, and you are at high risk for complications from the flu, it is important to see your doctor to ask if you should receive an antiviral medication such as Tamiflu (also available as generic oseltamivir), Relenza or Rapivab. "There are antiviral medications that can be used to shorten the duration of illness as well as to help prevent complications from the flu," Bocchini said. "Antiviral medications should be started early to have their best chance of helping." Take common-sense precautions to avoid exposure to the flu virus, such as washing your hands frequently and staying away from people who are sick. Stay home if you have flu-like symptoms until at least 24 hours after the fever is gone. When to seek emergency medical attention When the flu becomes severe, some people may need immediate medical attention to prevent further complications. "Sometimes people will need to go to the emergency room to see a doctor right away due to the flu virus," Bocchini said. "It is very important to know the signs and symptoms that indicate when someone is very sick from the flu and needs help right away." According to the CDC, emergency warning signs in children include: Fast      breathing or trouble breathing Bluish      skin color Not      drinking enough fluids Not      waking up or not interacting Being      so irritable that the child does not want to be held Flu-like      symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough Fever      with a rash In adults, emergency warning signs from flu may present as: Difficulty      breathing or shortness of breath Pain      or pressure in the chest or abdomen Sudden      dizziness Confusion Severe      or persistent vomiting Flu-like      symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worse cough If you or your child have these symptoms, it is important to get medical treatment right away.   © 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

"The typical estimate is 36,000 [deaths] a year in the United States," reports NBC, citing the Centers for Disease Control. "Somewhere between 4,000 and 8,000 Canadians a year die of influenza and its related complications, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada," the Globe and Mail says, adding that "Those numbers are controversial because they are estimates."       "Controversial" is an understatement, and not just in Canada, and not just because the numbers are estimates. The numbers differ wildly from the sober tallies recorded on death certificates -- by law every certificate must show a cause -- and reported by the official agencies that collect and keep vital statistics.       According to the National Vital Statistics System in the U.S., for example, annual flu deaths in 2010 amounted to just 500 per year -- fewer than deaths from ulcers (2,977), hernias (1,832) and pregnancy and childbirth (825), and a far cry from the big killers such as heart disease (597,689) and cancers (574,743). The story is similar in Canada, where unlikely killers likewise dwarf Statistics Canada's count of flu deaths.       Even that 500 figure for the U.S. could be too high, according to analyses in authoritative journals such as the American Journal of Public Health and the British Medical Journal. Only about 15-20 per cent of people who come down with flu-like symptoms have the influenza virus -- the other 80-85 per cent actually caught rhinovirus or other germs that are indistinguishable from the true flu without laboratory tests, which are rarely done. In 2001, a year in which death certificates listed 257 Americans as having died of flu, only 18 were positively identified as true flus. The other 239 were simply assumed to be flus and most likely had few true flus among them.       "U.S. data on influenza deaths are a mess," states a 2005 article in the British Medical Journal entitled " Are U.S. flu death figures more PR than science? " This article takes issue with the 36,000 flu-death figure commonly claimed, and with describing "influenza/pneumonia" as the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S.  "But why are flu and pneumonia bundled together?" the article asks. "Is the relationship so strong or unique to warrant characterizing them as a single cause of death?"  The article's answer is no. Most pneumonia deaths are unrelated to influenza. For example, "stomach acid suppressing drugs are associated with a higher risk of community-acquired pneumonia, but such drugs and pneumonia are not compiled as a single statistic," explained Dr. David Rosenthal, director of Harvard University Health Services. "People don't necessarily die, per se, of the [flu] virus -- the viraemia. What they die of is a secondary pneumonia."  Pneumonia, according to the American Lung Association, has more than 30 different causes , influenza being but one of them. The CDC itself acknowledges the slim relationship, saying "only a small proportion of deaths... only 8.5 per cent of all pneumonia and influenza deaths [are] influenza-related."  Because death certificates belie claims of numerous flu deaths, CDC enlisted computer models to arrive at its 36,000 flu-death estimate. But even here it needed to bend conventional medical terminology to arrive at compelling death numbers.  "Cause-of-death statistics are based solely on the underlying cause of death [internationally defined] as 'the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death,'" explains the National Center for Health Statistics. Because the flu was rarely an "underlying cause of death," the CDC created the sound-alike term, "influenza-associated death."  Using this new, loose definition, CDC's computer models could tally people who died of a heart ailment or other causes after having the flu. As William Thompson of the CDC's National Immunization Program admitted, influenza-associated mortality is "a statistical association ...  I don't know that we would say that it's the underlying cause of death."  The CDC's decision to play up flu deaths dates back a decade, when it realized the public wasn't following its advice on the flu vaccine. During the 2003 flu season "the manufacturers were telling us that they weren't receiving a lot of orders for vaccine,"Dr. Glen Nowak, associate director for communications at CDC's National Immunization Program, told National Public Radio. "It really did look like we needed to do something to encourage people to get a flu shot."  The CDC's response was its " Seven-Step 'Recipe ' for Generating Interest in, and Demand for, Flu (or any other) Vaccination," a slide show Nowak presented at the 2004 National Influenza Vaccine Summit.  Here is the "Recipe that fosters influenza vaccine interest and demand," in the truncated language that appears on his slides: "Medical experts and public health authorities [should] publicly (e.g. via media) state concern and alarm (and predict dire outcomes) - and urge influenza vaccination." This recipe, his slide show indicated, would result in "Significant media interest and attention ... in terms that motivate behavior (e.g. as 'very severe,' 'more severe than last or past years,' 'deadly')." Other emotive recommendations included fostering "the perception that many people are susceptible to a bad case of influenza" and "Visible/tangible examples of the seriousness of the illness (e.g., pictures of children, families of those affected coming forward) and people getting vaccinated (the first to motivate, the latter to reinforce)."  The CDC unabashedly decided to create a mass market for the flu vaccine by enlisting the media into panicking the public. An obedient and unquestioning media obliged by hyping the numbers, and 10 years later it is obliging still.  ALSO ON HUFFPOST:         Do I Have The Flu?

Experts discuss how this happens and what you need to know to protect yourself.   By Macaela Mackenzie  |  Jan 12, 2018      Photo: GolubaPhoto / Shutterstock Can you really die from the flu if you're healthy? Unfortunately, as a recent tragic case shows, the answer is yes. Kyle Baughman, a 21-year-old bodybuilder from Pennsylvania, was otherwise healthy when he got the flu, reports local news station WXPI . What started as an innocent runny nose, cough, and fever on December 23 landed him in the ER four days later—with a worsening cough and rising fever. A day later, Baughman died from organ failure and septic shock caused by the flu. (Related: Is It the Flu, a Cold, or Winter Allergies? ) Dying from flu complications happens more often than you think. According to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , every year up to 650,000 people around the world die from respiratory complications of the flu. While most of these deaths occur among the elderly or infants and people in poor countries, the death of a healthy 21-year-old bodybuilder isn't unheard of, says Darria Long Gillespie, M.D. , an ER physician and head of clinical strategy at Sharecare. "There are deaths in healthy people every single year, and it's an important example of just how tragic and deadly the flu virus can be." Still, cases like this aren't a reason to panic at the slightest cough. "You don't need to rush to the ER at the first sign of fever or body aches," says Peter Shearer, M.D., director of the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. "But if your symptoms or fever are getting worse, you should be evaluated." If you're starting to have flu symptoms (a runny nose, cough, fever above 102°F, body aches), see your primary care doctor to get started on Tamiflu, which is an antiviral treatment that can help reduce the severity of the flu. "It's important to get that early, within the first 48 hours," says Dr. Shearer. The best thing you can do to prevent serious complications from the flu is to get your flu shot. Yes, the vaccine varies in effectiveness from year to year, but you still need it. (So far, CDC estimates predict the 2017 vaccine is about 39 percent effective, which is less effective than previous years due to a particularly nasty strain of the virus going around this year. Get your flu shot anyway!) "Even though the flu vaccine is not 100 percent effective, it drastically reduces your chances of death and complications," says Dr. Gillespie. "Studies suggest that among people who die from the flu, anywhere from 75 to 95 percent of them were not vaccinated. The flu vaccine is a crucial tool in protecting all of us from the flu and its complications." That said, the vaccine may not have prevented this tragic death. "Even if someone does everything right, the nature of the flu virus is that it can cause severe, deadly complications, that no one could have foreseen or prevented," says Dr. Gillespie. If you do catch the flu, the most important thing you can do is rest up, says Dr. Gillespie. "The flu strains are particularly severe this year, and your body needs to rest, not tax itself," she says. Secondly, stay home. "Whole communities need to take care of each other when there's an outbreak like this," says Dr. Shearer. In other words, call in sick. Even if you think you can muscle through it, someone you pass the virus to might not be able to. Most people will feel better on their own with lots of rest, fluids, and cough medicine, says Dr. Gillespie. "If you have chronic illnesses such as asthma, COPD, or other chronic conditions, you may want to talk with your doctor about antiviral medications. If you experience shortness of breath, confusion, seizures, or lethargy or confusion, then seek care in the ER."

Kyler Baughman, who had no known health problems, died just after Christmas. His mother told WPXI News that his organs failed due to septic shock caused by the flu.  Story continues below        READ MORE: 21-year-old aspiring personal trainer dies after flu causes septic shock The case, while rare, isn’t the only flu-related death reported this season. And this year’s flu season in Canada is shaping up to be a nasty one, with experts warning that the peak of the season hasn’t even arrived yet . The predominant strain that is circulating is a “severe one,” Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at University Health Network in Toronto, told Global News. WATCH: Thousands of deaths annually associated with respiratory diseases from flu        But how common are deaths related to the flu? Bogoch says cases such as Baughman’s do occur. “It’s terrible, this is very sad,” Bogoch said, explaining that generally, deaths related to severe cases of influenza occur in the very young or elderly population, or among those who have pre-existing medical conditions. “It’s not common, yet it’s not uncommon for a healthy, young individual to have very bad outcomes.” READ MORE: The flu season in Canada is getting pretty nasty; here is everything you need to know Public Health Agency of Canada’s website states that there are about 12,200 cases of flu-related hospitalizations in Canada each year , and 3,500 deaths. While the illness is at times regarded as something people can push through, it’s more serious than that. The health agency reports that influenza is ranked among the top 10 leading causes of death in the country. And worldwide, the illness claims between 250,000 to 500,000 lives each year. WATCH: Study warns of deadly flu season        There are preemptive measures, such as getting the flu shot and washing your hands more often, that can help lower the chances of contracting the illness. But once you have the flu, here’s what Canadians should know about how to handle it — and when it’s time to get help. Regular flu symptoms vs. severe symptoms “People who have influenza are going to feel really crummy, they are going to have fevers, they might have muscle pains. They’re going to have fatigue,” Bogoch explains, saying these are typical flu symptoms. More severe forms of the flu have the same symptoms, Bogoch notes, but it just feels much worse. READ MORE: Signs you’re too sick and should stay home during the flu season “The things to look for are not new symptoms, but more severe symptoms,” he says. “It’s an intense weakness, and such a low appetite and fatigue that they’re really not able to keep up with their required food intake. That’s a problem because you can get quite sick and quite fast, and you might need to be seen in a medical facility.” Another indication that it’s time to get medical help is difficulty breathing. “It’s not a little bit of shortness of breath, but progressive shortness of breath,” which includes things like actually “huffing and puffing,” Bogoch explains. WATCH: Flu shot could be only 10% effective against predominant strain        Relief for people most at risk Bryna Warshawsky, Ontario Public Health’s medical director for communicable disease, explains that there are ways for those who are most at risk of severe influenza to lower their chances of becoming sick. Influenza anti-viral drugs, such as Tamiflu and Relenza, work to stop the virus from growing, according to Warshawsky. WATCH: Flu season overcrowding ERs throughout Montreal        “The way they work is they stop the virus from growing any more, so if you just have a little virus in you, and you take these, they stop you from getting any sicker than you are.” Warshawsky explains they are most commonly available for elderly people in nursing homes, and those who are admitted to the hospital with the flu. But other at-risk groups such as pregnant women, overweight individuals, and those with underlying medical problems, should consult their doctor about them. “Those are the people who could end up with pneumonia, end up in hospital or end up dying from the flu,” she said. How long should flu last? While it’s different for everyone, typically, flu symptoms should begin to clear up in a couple of days. But Bogoch says a virus will generally run its course, and people will just have to stick it out.

		            November 29, 2011      Facebook 0  Twitter 0  livefyre  Email  Print         Why we get sick and how to stay healthy during cold and flu season.  Here are some commonly asked questions and answers.  Q. Can flying on an airplane make you sick?  A. "Yes," says Bruce Polsky, chief of the division of infectious diseases at St. Luke’s–Roosevelt Hospital Center, in New York City. "Especially if you’re sitting within six feet of someone who is sneezing, coughing, and spewing germs into the dry air."  Because the air is recirculated in the close quarters of the plane’s cabin, certain kinds of germs may stay suspended, and you can end up breathing them in. Drink lots of water, and consider using a saline nasal spray to keep your mucous membranes moist. Q. Can your toothbrush or lipstick reinfect you after you’ve been sick? A. It’s not likely. “If you’ve just come out of a cold, don’t toss it,” says Neil Schachter, a professor of pulmonary and critical care at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City. “Once you’ve had a particular viral illness, you’re protected from it.”  Q. Can you get sick from touching a doorknob? A. Yes. Germs last longer than you think. “Viruses can survive up to three days on surfaces and inanimate objects,” says Chuck Gerba, a professor of environmental microbiology at the University of Arizona in Tucson. That’s why it’s a good idea to carry your own pen. To reduce the number of germs, be sure to zap hot spots (the phone, for instance) regularly at home and at work with a disinfecting product. Q. Can you catch the same cold or flu twice in the same season? A. You can’t get exactly the same one, as your body will have developed antibodies to it. But “cold and flu viruses mutate, so there are subtly different forms of the virus,” says Caroline Rudnick, an assistant professor of community and family medicine at St. Louis University. “Getting one type doesn’t protect you from another.” Even if you’ve had the flu vaccine, if a different strain of the flu virus is going around, you could catch it. Q. Is it safe to exercise with a cold? A. "Do a 'neck check': If your symptoms are in or above your neck―say, if you have a stuffy nose, a headache, and a mildly sore throat and you’re sneezing―it’s fine to work out," Schachter says. "But if your symptoms extend below the neck―if you have a cough, a fever, body aches, or chills―take a break from exercising until you feel better." Q. Can going outside with wet hair in the winter make you sick? A. Exposure to an infection, not cold temperatures, can make you sick. “But if your body gets cold, it could get physically stressed because it’s using a lot of energy to try to stay warm, and you might be more likely to catch an infection,” Rudnick explains. To avoid stressing your body unnecessarily, dry your hair before going out in the cold, or wear a hat.  ________________________________________________________________________________  More From Real Simple:  6 Allergen-Free Snacks for Kids  6 Ways to Have Healthy Holidays  6 Natural Cold-Prevention Strategies ________________________________________________________________________________  What Makes You Vulnerable to Colds and Flus Normally your body’s barriers, including your skin and the linings of your airways and gastrointestinal tract, keep invaders out. But low immunity, contact with a heavy germ load, high stress, and some surprising factors can increase your chances of getting sick.  Having fewer illnesses in childhood could affect your health as an adult. Paradoxically, people who were frequently sick with viral infections as children typically have greater immunity and are susceptible to fewer infections as adults. “Antibodies last a lifetime,” says James A. Wilde, an infectious-disease specialist and the director of the pediatric emergency department at the Medical College of Georgia , in Augusta. When your child is sick with her third cold of the season, remind yourself that it may be helpful to her in the long run.  Cold temperatures and low humidity, indoors and out, can irritate or damage your airways. Air pollution, indoor dust, and ash from fireplaces can also act as irritants, causing inflammation and making it easier for germs to enter your system, says Russell Robertson, chair of the department of family medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, in Chicago .  Smoking can make you prone to bacterial and viral infections. “Smoking damages the linings of the nose and throat, which not only offer barrier protection but also have a coating of fine filaments, called cilia, on the surface,” says Neil Schachter, a professor of pulmonary and critical care at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City. That’s why smokers tend to have more frequent and worse colds than nonsmokers. Exposure to secondhand smoke can also lower your natural defenses.  Stress, lack of sleep, and poor nourishment can also set you up for getting sick. Stress and fatigue can lower your resistance to infection and increase the intensity of illnesses you do get. (For more on how stress can make you sick, see Manage Your Stress.) But there may be a bit of a lag between a stressful event and when you become ill.  “When you’re in a period of maximal stress, you’re releasing a lot of adrenaline, which keeps you going,” says Bruce Polsky, chief of the division of infectious diseases at St. Luke’s–Roosevelt Hospital Center, in New York City. “Once that stressful stimulus is over or removed, you crash.”  If you’re under long-term stress, you’re especially susceptible to illness, because chronically elevated stress hormones can suppress immune function and lower the activity of germ-fighting white blood cells. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that severe chronic stress―from such things as conflicts with family or friends and unemployment―significantly increases a person’s risk of coming down with a cold.  How to Stay Healthy During Cold and Flu Season Strengthen your body’s defenses by eating well, drinking lots of water, exercising regularly, and staying away from people who appear sick. If you do get a bug, pamper yourself. Eat antioxidant-rich foods, such as whole-grain cereals, walnuts, and artichokes, as well as foods packed with omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon. “The antioxidants protect the body’s tissues against stress and inflammation and enhance immune function,” says Cindy Moore, a registered dietitian and the director of nutrition therapy at the Cleveland Clinic. “Omega-3 fatty acids promote blood flow and the production of anti-inflammatory substances,” which also boost immune function.  Take a brisk walk every day. Any kind of moderate daily exercise―such as cycling, swimming, or working out at the gym―can improve lung and immune function. Physical activity enhances the ability of T lymphocytes (white blood cells that attack virus and cancer cells) to ramp up the immune response, says Neil Schachter, a professor of pulmonary and critical care at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City. But don’t push yourself too hard. Some studies suggest that high-intensity exercise for two or more hours at a time increases stress hormones, which can lead to suppression of the immune system.  Stay three or more feet away from people who are coughing or sneezing. This will keep you outside the immediate spray of their germs, says Chuck Gerba, a professor of environmental microbiology at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. If you’re not near a sink during the day or you work in a high-germ environment, such as a school, carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you.  As you’ve been told millions of times, drink lots of water, don’t skimp on sleep, and get a flu shot. The tried-and-true advice still holds. Staying well hydrated keeps the tissues of the respiratory system moist and helps the immune system work properly. Sleep helps the body function at an optimum level. If you get seven to eight hours of rest a night, you’ll be less likely to become sick, and if you do catch something, you’ll recover faster. October through November is the best time to be immunized, even if you’re a healthy adult. If you can’t stand needles, ask your doctor about FluMist, a prescription nasal-spray vaccine that’s as effective as a shot.  Finally, stay home from work when you first feel ill. It’s possible that work-related stress (not to mention commuting) could slow your recovery. Tell your boss that Real Simple said so.  Click here to read more cold and flu stories.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED What makes flu outbreak an 'epidemic'? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What makes flu outbreak an 'epidemic'?  03:02 Story highlights The type of flu going around is called Influenza A (H3N2) The flu kills about 36,000 people a year in the United States, according to the CDC People with medical conditions and weakened immune systems are most at risk An early and severe start to the flu season has many health experts concerned. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 47 states are experiencing widespread activity, although it appears to be decreasing in some areas. According to the CDC, this is the most flu cases they've seen at this time of year in more than a decade. Twenty pediatric flu-related deaths have occurred since the start of the season. The CDC does not track adult flu-related deaths. The peak of the season, which usually happens in February, may be yet to come for most states -- officials said Friday it may be a week or two before it becomes clear whether cases have peaked. Here are some common flu questions from readers answered: Why is this year's flu causing more severe cases? The type of flu that is going around is called Influenza A (H3N2), which is often linked to more serious diseases than other flu varieties, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told CNN. People could get more complications from this particular strain, which would make them sick for a longer period of time. How is this flu season different than last year's? The 2011-2012 flu season began late and was relatively mild compared with previous seasons, according to the CDC . In fact, the season's peak set a record for the lowest and shortest since surveillance began. The number of pediatric flu-related deaths was also low last year. The CDC reported 26 children under the age of 18 had died by May 25, 2012. As a comparison, 122 pediatric flu-related deaths were reported during the 2010-2011 season.

MUST WATCH Flu epidemic sweeps country  03:15 How many people usually die from the flu each year? The flu kills about 36,000 people a year in the United States, according to the CDC, though the range varies greatly each year. Most deaths are caused by complications from the flu. Children under 2 years old, adults over 65, pregnant women and American Indians are at a greater risk of suffering from flu complications, according to the CDC. People with medical conditions like asthma, lung disease, heart disease and people with weakened immune systems are also at risk. How does someone go from having the flu to dying? Most of the people who die have underlying illnesses or a weakened immune system, says Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. The flu can weaken the immune system even more, which can lead to a complication like a bacterial infection. "It is that bacterial infection that most often causes death, especially in the younger population," Gupta says. So if I get the flu, should I go to the emergency room? Most people with the flu don't have to -- they'll recover on their own in five to seven days with plenty of rest and fluids, says Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. However, you should go to the ER immediately if: -- You have difficulty breathing or have pain in your chest -- You can't keep fluids down because of nausea and vomiting -- Your fever or cough gets better, then worsens "Let's say you have the flu, you get better, you think everything is all clear," Gupta says. "Then a couple days later, the fever comes back. That means you may now have a bacterial infection." Does this mean the flu vaccine isn't working? The flu vaccine is only about 60% effective , according to the CDC. How well the vaccine works can vary based on your age and health, as well as how good the "match" of the vaccine is to this year's flu strain. Each year, the vaccine is made from three strains of the influenza virus that researchers suspect will be the most active. So far, according to the CDC, this year's vaccine matches well with the most predominant type of flu spreading in the United States, but is less well matched to the No. 2 type of virus. The vaccine usually works best in young, healthy people, according to Dr. Bill Schaffner, chairman of the preventative medicine department at Vanderbilt University. But even if you do get the flu, the vaccine can protect against harsher complications. Learn more about the flu vaccine's effectiveness Will the flu vaccine make me sick? The virus used in the flu shot is a dead virus, Gupta says. "You cannot get the flu from a flu shot." But your body's immune system will react, and that can make you feel pain in your arm or feel less than 100% for a few days. Is there a flu vaccine shortage? While CNN has heard reports of vaccine shortages in some areas, manufacturers say there are vaccines available for anyone who wants to get a flu shot. There was a temporary delay in new shipments of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu due to an increased demand, according to a spokeswoman. Tamiflu can help reduce the severity and length of flu symptoms if taken early. Learn more about the reported shortages I'm sold! Is it too late to get the vaccine? In one word: no. Keep in mind that it takes about two weeks for antibodies to develop in your body and provide protection against the virus, the CDC says. Opinion: Next time, get the vaccine early  How can I avoid getting the flu in the first place? It's disturbing to think about, but flu germs can spread up to 6 feet through coughs and sneezes. They can also live on surfaces for up to eight hours. Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician and mother of two, recommends practicing good "social distancing." This means canceling parties or dates if someone is sick and avoiding large crowds (like at the movies or going out to dinner) if your community has been hit hard by the virus. It's also a good idea to practice proper hand-washing -- for at least 20 seconds several times a day. And wiping handles, counters and remotes daily with hot soapy water or disinfectant will kill any germs that linger.

Influenza, commonly called the flu, is not the same as stomach "flu" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.  For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. People at higher risk of developing flu complications include:   Young children under 5, and especially those under 2 years  Adults older than 65  Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities  Pregnant women and women up to two weeks postpartum  People with weakened immune systems  People who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes  People who are very obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher   Your best defense against influenza is to receive an annual vaccination.      Symptoms Initially, the flu may seem like a common cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. But colds usually develop slowly, whereas the flu tends to come on suddenly. And although a cold can be a nuisance, you usually feel much worse with the flu.  Common signs and symptoms of the flu include:   Fever over 100.4 F (38 C)  Aching muscles, especially in your back, arms and legs  Chills and sweats  Headache  Dry, persistent cough  Fatigue and weakness  Nasal congestion  Sore throat   When to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can treat themselves at home and often don't need to see a doctor.  If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your doctor right away. Taking antiviral drugs within the first 48 hours after you first notice symptoms may reduce the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Flu viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly, or you can pick up the germs from an object — such as a telephone or computer keyboard — and then transfer them to your eyes, nose or mouth.  People with the virus are likely contagious from the day or so before symptoms first appear until about five days after symptoms begin, though sometimes people are contagious for as long as 10 days after symptoms appear. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.  Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing regularly. If you've had influenza in the past, your body has already made antibodies to fight that particular strain of the virus. If future influenza viruses are similar to those you've encountered before, either by having the disease or by vaccination, those antibodies may prevent infection or lessen its severity.  But antibodies against flu viruses you've encountered in the past can't protect you from new influenza subtypes that can be very different immunologically from what you had before.  Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of developing influenza or its complications include:   Age. Seasonal influenza tends to target young children and older adults.  Living or working conditions. People who live or work in facilities along with many other residents, such as nursing homes or military barracks, are more likely to develop influenza.  Weakened immune system. Cancer treatments, anti-rejection drugs, corticosteroids and HIV/AIDS can weaken your immune system. This can make it easier for you to catch influenza and may also increase your risk of developing complications.  Chronic illnesses. Chronic conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or heart problems, may increase your risk of influenza complications.  Pregnancy. Pregnant women are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Women who are two weeks postpartum are also more likely to develop influenza-related complications.  Obesity. People with a BMI of 40 or more have an increased risk of complications from the flu.   Complications If you're young and healthy, seasonal influenza usually isn't serious. Although you may feel miserable while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects. But high-risk children and adults may develop complications such as:   Pneumonia  Bronchitis  Asthma flare-ups  Heart problems  Ear infections   Pneumonia is the most serious complication. For older adults and people with a chronic illness, pneumonia can be deadly.  Prevention The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone over the age of 6 months.  Each year's seasonal flu vaccine contains protection from the three or four influenza viruses that are expected to be the most common during that year's flu season. The vaccine is currently available as an injection only. The CDC no longer recommends nasal spray flu vaccinations because during recent flu seasons, the spray has been relatively ineffective.  Controlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100 percent effective, so it's also important to take measures such as these to reduce the spread of infection:   Wash your hands. Thorough and frequent hand-washing is an effective way to prevent many common infections. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers if soap and water aren't readily available.  Contain your coughs and sneezes. Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. To avoid contaminating your hands, cough or sneeze into a tissue or into the inner crook of your elbow.  Avoid crowds. Flu spreads easily wherever people congregate — in child care centers, schools, office buildings, auditoriums and public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you reduce your chances of infection. And, if you're sick, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever subsides so that you lessen your chance of infecting others.

Most people–young and old–who get sick recover. Find out what makes a person more at risk for serious complications.     Sarah Klein  January 24, 2018       By all accounts, it’s been a pretty terrible flu season . There’s widespread flu activity across the country, a vaccine that’s not all that effective, and an onslaught of news stories of flu-related deaths.  Adults and children who otherwise seemed healthy are dying from the flu shortly after developing symptoms, according to accounts from their families. Michael Messenger , 12, died just days after a rapid flu test at an urgent care center came back negative. Katharine Gallagher , 27, died five days after leaving work early with flu symptoms, which progressed to severe acute bronchial pneumonia. It’s all more than a little frightening.  But what are your actual chances of dying from the flu—and how does it even happen? Health spoke to Pat Salber, MD , a former emergency room physician based in San Francisco and the founder of the blog The Doctor Weighs In to get answers.      What are the chances of dying from the flu?  The number of people who get sick with the flu, require hospitalization, or ultimately die from the virus changes annually depending on several factors, including which strain of the virus is dominant and the strength of that year's vaccine. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 12,000 and 56,000 flu-related deaths occur each year.  That's still a relatively small number, considering that the number of flu cases in a given year can clock in at up to 60.8 million, according to the CDC. “In some of these pandemics, millions of people get infected, so death is relatively uncommon,” Dr. Salber says.  RELATED: 20 Surprising Ways to Prevent Colds and Flu  How does someone die from the flu?  Some victims may contract a second infection while already battling the flu, like pneumonia (an infection of the air sacs of the lungs), which can be severe enough to lead to organ failure and ultimately death, Dr. Salber says. The flu can be further complicated by sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to an infection that happens when bacteria have entered the bloodstream.    Other people may die from the flu because their immune systems are already compromised by another illness. “Getting the flu can exacerbate conditions like diabetes, asthma, and chronic lung disease,” Dr. Salber explains. “If someone with diabetes has mild renal failure, gets the flu, doesn’t keep up with hydration—which makes renal function worse—and can’t fight off the flu infection as well because they already have a lowered immune response, they can start to spiral out of control.”  But even healthy people can die of the flu, as news reports of deaths among children often suggest. “Young kids who look really healthy may be getting overwhelmed by their own immune response,” Dr. Salber says. In some cases, the body may increase immune defenses so much that infection-fighting proteins build up in the blood and damage other organs. “For example, you can get this immune response in the lungs,” she says, which in turn makes it hard to breathe. “Kids complaining of shortness of breath is not regular with the flu.”      Who is most at risk of dying?  Older adults and young kids are most at risk for serious complications of the flu, including hospitalization and death. Older folks are more likely to have weakened immune systems to begin with due to underlying health concerns, and they're also more prone to developing a secondary infection, Dr. Salber says. Kids may be more likely to have an overwhelming immune system response simply because they may not have had previous exposure to a particularly aggressive strain of the flu.  “We know that H3N2 seems to be causing all the problems this year, and it hasn’t been around for a number of years,” she says. “Kids who were born after the last time H3N2 was the dominant strain won’t have pre-formed antibodies, so the virus can spread more rapidly.”      Everyone has a different immune system, and the way an individual responds to the flu varies. Although our understanding of the flu has come a long way, “there are still lots of unknowns, unfortunately,” she says.  RELATED: 11 Signs It’s More Serious Than the Common Cold  How can someone with the flu stay safe?  This is not the time to play the hero. “Have a low threshold for when to contact a health care professional,” Dr. Salber says, especially if you feel like you're the sickest you’ve ever been or you have severe, out-of-the-ordinary symptoms, such as shortness of breath.  “Most illnesses start out mild, you get sicker, and then you start getting better,” she explains. “If you’re getting sicker and sicker, don’t wait it out.” A doctor may decide to give you an antiviral treatment like Tamiflu or Relenza, or diagnosis and treat a secondary bacterial infection with antibiotics. Follow Mom’s advice too: Get plenty of rest, and stay hydrated to give your body the best shot at beating the flu safely and quickly.

Getting your flu shot is still the best way to protect yourself against the flu—yes, even if it's late in flu season. “We know the flu vaccine is likely to be less effective this year, but it still has some protection,” Dr. Salber says. It’s better than nothing, and it helps protect the most vulnerable among us.  “Young healthy people might say, ‘I can gut it out,’ but if you go visit Grandma, [and give her the flu], maybe she can’t gut it out. Get your flu shot not to just protect yourself, but your loved ones.” Wash your hands regularly too, she adds, and don’t feel bad politely bowing out of a handshake. Your life, or someone else's, may be at stake.

By  Lisa Ryan @lisarya   Share      Share      Tweet      Pin It     xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?     Created with Sketch.                  Comment                 The 2018 flu season is particularly dangerous.   Photo: FPG/Getty Images      While you might typically think of the flu as a mere annoyance (or a great excuse to skip work and binge old episodes of Gossip Girl all day long), this year’s flu season is actually quite dangerous. It seems like you can’t turn on the news or scroll through social media without reading about yet another tragic flu-related death , and, chances are, everyone you know has already been bed-ridden because of this year’s strain.  To figure out why the 2018 flu season is so deadly, the Cut spoke with Kristen Nordlund, press officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Uh … what exactly is going on with this year’s flu strain? ﻿Each year, there are usually a few different strains of the flu virus circulating around. But in 2018, we’re seeing more of the Influenza A-H3N2 than any other strain, Nordlund said. And any year in which this is the dominant strain tends to be worse than usual — just like during the horrible 2014-15 season, which saw an estimated 34 million people come down with the flu. “We know in general those seasons tend to be more severe especially for older adults and young children,” Nordlund said.    What is it about this year that’s so particularly bad, though? Given that the H3N2 strain has been dominant in previous years, you’re likely wondering why everyone’s in such a panic about this particular season. Well, according to Nordlund, it’s because of the timing of it all — and just how widespread the dang thing has been. “In previous seasons it tends to happen in different parts of the United States at different times,” she said. “This is one of the first years we’ve really seen that widespread activity is everywhere. Flu is really across the board in every state at the same time.”      Nordlund went on to explain that although each flu season is different, sometimes you don’t really see much activity until January. But this year, flu season started in November, meaning that it was happening right when everyone was being social over the holidays, potentially helping it spread. “The timing of it lined up with some of those large gatherings,” she added.  Yikes. So, how many people have actually died this year? No one really knows! Nordlund told the Cut that there have already been 37 recorded influenza-related deaths in kids under the age of 18 so far this year. “That is higher than we saw at this time last year but somewhat comparable to the 2014-15 season,” she said. The CDC expert explained that it’s tough to track the precise number of how many people actually die from the flu each year — there are usually way more flu-associated deaths than actually end up listed on death certificates. So overall, the CDC estimates that anywhere from 12,000 to 56,000 people could die from the virus in any given year.    Oh, God. Well, when will this thing be over? When exactly this year’s flu season will end is yet another thing no one really knows. Nordlund told the Cut in late January that we hadn’t seen the peak of this flu season yet (so its activity is not even starting to decline at this point), and we won’t know how many people have died from the flu until it’s actually over. “Flu activity overall tends to peter out as it gets warmer,” she told the Cut. “So we know because of how high activity is that it’s likely we’re going to see many more weeks of flu activity, but how many more — we don’t know.”  Greaaattt. Is there anything we can do to protect ourselves? Sure. This year’s flu may be horrible, but you still have time to get a flu shot, according to Nordlund. And of course, there’s also the basic preventive actions, like washing your hands, staying home if you’re sick, and covering your cough or sneezes. But just a warning: If you already got the flu this year, that doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed to not get it again before the season is over. “You can get the flu twice in one season because you can get a different strain,” Nordlund cautioned.

MUST WATCH How the flu can turn deadly  01:39 Story highlights Flu commonly kills the elderly by leading to pneumonia, but can prove lethal in other ways Children, especially those under age 5, are at higher risk than healthy adults for flu-related complications (CNN) This flu season is fierce and has already claimed the lives of at least 37 children in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 11,965 laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations reported from October 1 to January 20. The number of people infected with influenza is believed to be much higher because not everyone goes to their doctor when they are sick, nor do doctors test every patient. Added to those scary stats, the World Health Organization estimates that annual flu epidemics result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness globally and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths. Fierce, deadly flu season still not peaked, CDC says Although the fever and aches may feel terrible, most of us don't die from the flu. So how exactly does this common illness lead to so many dying? "Influenza and its complications disproportionately affect people who are 65 and older. They account for 80% of the deaths," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. Read More But young children and people who have an underlying illness, such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, are susceptible to dying from the flu as well, he said. There are three ways adults can succumb: Pneumonia What is pneumonia? "The usual flu death is a person who gets influenza, gets all that inflammation in their chest, and then has the complication of pneumonia," explained Schaffner, who added that this is a "long, drawn-out process." Pneumonia is an infection that causes the small air sacs of the lungs to fill with fluid or pus. Though this is the most common route to death, flu can be fatal for more unusual reasons. Sepsis How my daughter died from a simple case of flu "Much of the systemic symptoms that any of us have with influenza -- the fever, the aches and pains, the sense of exhaustion -- all of those are part of (our body's) response to the virus," said Schaffner. The symptoms we experience are an inflammatory response to the immune system "soldiers" that our body sends to fight any pathogen, he said. "Pushing the war analogy, we all know there is incidental damage that occurs during the course of a war," said Schaffner, and so the flu can also take a perfectly healthy person "and put them in the ER in 24 to 48 hours." Flu stimulates an immune response in everyone's body, but for some people, this natural response can be "overwhelming," noted Schaffner. "Young robust people can have such an overwhelming response that it's called a cytokine storm." Cytokines -- proteins that are created as part of the inflammatory response -- create a "storm" in the body, explained Schaffner: "And this cytokine storm can actually lead to sepsis in the person." What is sepsis? Kyler Baughman, 21 , is one example of that happening. He died unexpectedly in December at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh after a bout with the flu. Baughman, a college student, worked two jobs and often posted pictures of himself at the gym on social media. The cause of his death, as reported by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner, was influenza, septic shock and multiple organ failure. Heart attack Chances of a heart attack are increased sixfold during the first seven days after a flu infection, a new study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found. The study looked at nearly 20,000 cases of flu in Ontario adults age 35 or older. What are heart failure, heart attack and cardiac arrest? The risk may be higher for older adults, said Dr. Jeff Kwong, lead author of the study and a scientist at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences and Public Health Ontario. Heart attack occurs when blood flow to the heart is abruptly cut off; this is also called acute myocardial infarction. Since a few days usually elapse between getting sick and getting a lab test, Kwong said "the increased risk is probably within the first 10 days or so after exposure to the virus." The research, which identified 364 hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction among the flu cases studied, also showed a stronger association for influenza B than influenza A. "We would have needed more cases to determine if the difference was real or just a chance finding," said Kwong. Though the new study did not identify the reasons why flu might lead to heart attack, Kwong and his co-authors theorize that infectious illness may cause inflammation, stress and constriction of blood vessels, which increases blood pressure. Threats to children The overwhelming majority -- 99% -- of children under age 5 who die from flu-related illness are in developing countries . Children in the developed world may not face such high risks, but they are still vulnerable if they develop flu. Sepsis resulting from flu can cause the death of very young children, said Dr. Flor M. Munoz, an associate professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. 5 ways to protect your child in flu season "Children have different risks depending on their age," said Munoz, and the most worrisome ages are "infants in the first year of life and those under 5 years of age." "What's different from adults is children have a lot of opportunities to not only be exposed to flu but also to spread the flu," said Munoz. In general, children are the first to get sick when flu season begins, mainly because they are in school and playing with others -- and spreading germs. "They can be completely healthy and still have problems with the flu," said Munoz. "The flu shot doesn't offer the same protection as it does for adults." Flu widespread throughout the nation, 30 children dead This is due to the lack of "immunologic experience" that children have. The immune system in infants is "still developing and it has different responses, let's say, to new things," said Munoz. "Young children will not necessarily have the same response that older children, adolescents or adults have." The same is true for very old people, said Munoz: "That's just a normal way the immune system works." However, the worry whenever a young child or infant gets flu symptoms, including fever, is that they might have a more serious infection occurring at the same time. "Young children at that age can have meningitis, pneumonia, bacterial infections, not necessarily flu-related," said Munoz. "One needs to be more cautious." Could this be a better way to build a flu vaccine? "Certainly, we do tend to see secondary infections," said Munoz. So a child will start with the flu and the irritation in their noses and throats leave them exposed to more germs and so they develop another bacterial infection --- ear infections, say, or sinusitis or pneumonia. With the child's immune system already fighting the flu and then another bacteria on top of that, sepsis may be the result. These are the cases we hear on the news, said Munoz, "previously healthy children that don't feel well and in a day or two they die of some complication." Another threat? Though children and adults experience the same symptoms when sick with the flu, children are more likely to get diarrhea and to vomit. This can lead to dehydration in infants and small children, Munoz said, and it can be life-threatening at such a young age. What do parents need to know? "Every year we're going to have the flu. Every year we have anywhere between 50 and 100 deaths of children from the flu," said Munoz, who is also a member of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics. "This is something to be taken seriously." How to recover from the flu Parents can make sure their children are vaccinated, she said. "As a mother, if you have something at hand that can protect your child, why not?" "It's a very safe vaccine -- it is not true that you can get the flu with the vaccine," she added. Lynnette Brammer, head of the CDC's Domestic Flu Surveillance team, supported Munoz' view. "We want to continue to emphasize that there's still a lot of flu activity to come, people that haven't been vaccinated should still get vaccine," said Brammer. "We may be getting close to the peak of this wave, it's not unusual to have a second wave of influenza B come through."

The flu shot is admittedly imperfect, Schaffner said, but there are still benefits. "If you get the vaccine and you have a flu-like illness, it's likely the illness is less severe," he said. "Data show you're less likely to get pneumonia and less likely to die." If a child, especially a small one, becomes sick, parents should visit a doctor or health care provider who may prescribe medication, said Munoz. By treating illness, antiviral drugs become a second line of defense against serious consequences. While most otherwise healthy people will not need to be prescribed antiviral drugs, those who may benefit from these medications are "people who are high risk, the elderly, children under 2, pregnant women and people with chronic health problems," said Brammer. Antiviral drugs are known to work best when started within two days of getting sick. Studies show these drugs, which rarely produce side effects , can lessen symptoms and shorten the time a person is sick by one or two days. "It's a brisk influenza season and I think it will end up being a moderately severe one," said Schaffner. "We'll take any bit of protection and prevention we can get."

USA Today Network Domenica Bongiovanni, The Indianapolis Star Published 8:16 p.m. ET Feb. 10, 2018 | Updated 8:18 p.m. ET Feb. 10, 2018 CLOSE Health officials say flu season continues to get worse, and there are weeks of suffering ahead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday reported 42 states had heavy flu-related patient traffic last week, up from 39 the week before. (Feb. 2) AP Lab technologist Sharda Modi tests a patient's swab for a flu infection at Upson Regional Medical Center in Thomaston, Ga., on Friday, Feb. 9, 2018. A government report out Friday shows 1 of every 13 visits to the doctor last week was for fever, cough and other symptoms of the flu. That ties the highest level seen in the U.S. during swine flu in 2009. (Photo: David Goldman, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 37 COMMENT EMAIL MORE INDIANAPOLIS — As far as flu seasons go, experts are saying the levels of visits to hospitals and emergency rooms for this one are comparable to the 2009 swine flu. As such, reports of otherwise healthy or young people dying from the infection are flying around. The stories have been shocking, especially because many of these people were outside the high-risk groups for flu-related death that include pregnant women, small children and the elderly. So far in the 2017-2018 season, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 63 pediatric deaths. This compares to 110 deaths in 2016-2017, 93 in 2015-2016 and 148 in 2014-2015. Feb. 9: This flu season is the worst in nearly a decade — and it's not getting better Feb. 7: Televangelist Gloria Copeland says you don't need flu shot if you have Jesus The CDC does not know how many deaths are caused overall from the seasonal flu because, among other reasons, flu-related deaths happen a few weeks after someone is infected and are often caused by a secondary illness or a pre-existing condition. From the 2010-2011 to the 2013-2014 seasons, the CDC gives a range of 12,000 (during the 2011-2012 season) to 56,000 (2012-2013) deaths. Here are some reasons why otherwise healthy people can die from the flu. Pneumonia The infection causes inflammation in your lungs and can attack just after the flu. Harmful bacteria already in your body, or that enters while your immune system is fighting the flu, can multiply when your system is compromised. Pneumonia can come on when you're just starting to feel better a few days after the flu has struck, according to Popular Science . WebMD outlines symptoms including chills, fever, chest pains, sweating, a cough producing green or bloody mucus, and bluish lips or nails caused from an inadequate amount of oxygen. Especially if you experience a high fever or it's difficult to breathe, call your doctor or visit a hospital. Depending on the type of pneumonia you have, antibiotics could help. Heart attack A January article in the New England Journal of Medicine found a "significant association" between respiratory infections, including the flu, and acute myocardial infarction — the medical term for a heart attack. The authors found that people were six times more likely to have a heart attack during the first seven days after being diagnosed with the flu than in the year before and after it. Feb. 5: Got the flu? Here's what works to lessen the misery Feb. 5: Pink sang the national anthem with the flu. How to know when symptoms are serious Inflammation and the stress the flu puts on your body can lead to a greater risk of blood clots near your heart, study author Dr. Jeff Kwong told NPR . Most of those who had heart attacks the week they had the flu tended to be older and had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other conditions associated with heart disease, Kwong said. Sepsis Infections in your lungs, kidneys, skin and gut can trigger sepsis. As your body releases chemicals into the bloodstream to fight infections, your immune system can go too far and cause inflammation in — and damage — several organs. Sepsis can take hold after pneumonia that occurs after the flu, according to the Sepsis Alliance . The CDC calls sepsis life-threatening and highlights that without treatment, it can result in damaged tissues, failed organs and death. According to WebMD , symptoms include rapid breathing, confusion, fever and chills, low body temperature, urinating less than usual and diarrhea. Catching it in the early stages is key to treatment and survival. CLOSE If you don't want to catch the sniffles, here are four ways to travel without getting the bug. USA TODAY Wondering if you have the flu? Here's more basic information Question: What are the symptoms of the flu? Answer: The CDC lists the following: fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting. If these symptoms are somewhat mild, the CDC suggests staying home to avoid spreading germs. High-risk groups include young kids, people age 65 and over, pregnant women and those with chronic lung disease, heart disease, asthma, kidney disorders and those on chronic steroids. Q: How long are you contagious? A: You can spread the flu from the day before you exhibit any symptoms until about seven days after. So stay home during this time unless you're seeking medical treatment. You can get the flu by breathing in droplets that infected people have sneezed or coughed into the air or by touching your face after touching an infected surface. Feb. 2: The nasty flu season could cost U.S. businesses $15B in lost productivity Feb. 2: Child death toll in flu season hits 53 as hospitalizations soar Q: Does the flu vaccine work? A: Those who have been vaccinated lessen their risk of contracting influenza B and influenza A (H1N1) the most, according to the CDC. The most common strain so far this year is A (H3N2). The CDC said the vaccine offers less protection against this one because H3N2 is more likely to have changed than other strains since the vaccine was formulated. The vaccine is about 30% effective against H3N2, according to the CDC. Experts strongly recommend that everyone over the age of six months be vaccinated. Q: Is it too late to get a flu shot? A: No. The flu season can last from October until May. It takes about two weeks for the shot to take hold. Even those who are allergic to eggs should get the shot this year, said Dr. Christopher Belcher, medical director of infection control for St. Vincent Health. The egg protein in the vaccine isn't enough to set off allergic reactions in most people.

Chances are good that some of the advice friends and family gave you about avoiding or dealing with the flu was wrong. There seems to be no shortage of misinformation and bad advice when it comes to dealing with the flu.  Here are 10 common myths about the flu.    MYTH: You can catch the flu from the vaccine. The vaccine is made from an inactivated virus that can't transmit infection. So people who get sick after receiving a flu vaccination were going to get sick anyway. It takes a week or two to get protection from the vaccine. But people assume that because they got sick after getting the vaccine, the shot caused their illness.    MYTH: Healthy people don't need to be vaccinated. While it's especially important for people who have a chronic illness to get the flu shot, anyone — even healthy folks — can benefit from being vaccinated. Current CDC guidelines recommend yearly vaccination against influenza for everyone older than 6 months of age, including pregnant women.    MYTH: Getting the flu vaccination is all you need to do to protect yourself from the flu. There are a number of steps you can take to protect yourself during flu season besides vaccination. Avoid contact with people who have the flu, wash your hands frequently, and consider taking anti-viral medications if you were exposed to the flu before being vaccinated.    MYTH: The flu is just a bad cold. Influenza may cause bad cold symptoms, like sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, and cough. But in the United States alone, 36,000 people die and more than 200,000 are hospitalized each year because of the flu. During the 2017/18 flu season, flu activity has significantly increased throughout the majority of the country with the A(H3N2) viruses predominating so far, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). A(H3N2) virus-predominant influenza seasons have been associated with more hospitalizations and deaths in people age 65 years and older as well as young children. It's not too late to get a flu shot. Even if it doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it can decrease the chance of severe symptoms.    MYTH: You can't spread the flu if you're feeling well. Actually, 20% to 30% of people carrying the influenza virus have no symptoms.    MYTH: You don't need to get a flu shot every year. The influenza virus changes (mutates) each year. So getting vaccinated each year is important to make sure you have immunity to the strains most likely to cause an outbreak.    MYTH: You can catch the flu from going out in cold weather without a coat, with wet hair or by sitting near a drafty window. The only way to catch the flu is by being exposed to the influenza virus. Flu season coincides with the cold weather. So people often associate the flu with a cold, drafty environment. But, they are not related.    MYTH: Feed a cold, starve a fever. If you have the flu (or a cold) and a fever, you need more fluids. There's little reason to increase or decrease how much you eat. Though you may have no appetite, "starving" yourself will accomplish little. And poor nutrition will not help you get better.    MYTH: Chicken soup will speed your recovery from the flu. Hot liquids can soothe a sore throat and provide much needed fluids. But chicken soup has no other specific qualities that can help fight the flu.    MYTH: If you have a high fever with the flu that lasts more than a day or two, antibiotics may be necessary. Antibiotics work well against bacteria, but they aren't effective for a viral infection like the flu. Then again, some people develop a bacterial infection as a complication of the flu, so it may be a good idea to get checked out if your symptoms drag on or worsen .    The flu is a good example of how medical myths can get in the way of good medical care. When it's flu season, take the necessary steps to stay healthy. That includes separating fact from myth.

Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     The United States is in the midst of a deadly flu season . The latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that 37 children have died so far this flu season, which began in October. The flu is currently widespread in 49 states, and doctors across the country continue to see more cases, more hospitalizations, and more deaths from influenza infections. Over the past several weeks, deaths of Americans of all ages from the flu have made headlines. The family of 12-year-old Dylan Winnick, who died from the flu in Florida last week, said they were stunned by how quickly the virus took his life. "No indications. No warnings. Just common cold. That's what's so scary about it," his stepfather Mike Medwin said. Two young mothers – Tandy Harmon of Gersham, Oregon, and Karlie Illg Slaven of Hendricks County, Indiana – also died of the flu last week. Their families said they were healthy until the sudden illness struck. While flu is most dangerous for adults over the age of 65 and children under the age of 5, it can turn deadly for anyone. The number of flu-related deaths varies widely from year to year, but even during a relatively mild flu season the illness claims thousands of lives. The CDC reports that over a three-decade period starting in the mid-1970s, the number of flu deaths in the U.S. ranged from a low of about 3,000 a year to as many as 49,000 in a bad year. How does the flu lead to death? While it is possible for the flu itself to cause death due to serious breathing problems and severe dehydration, according to Dr. Claire Bocchini, an infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital, it is more likely that a complication from the infection will be the cause of a flu-related fatality. The most common complication from the flu that can lead to death is a bacterial infection of the lungs, or bacterial pneumonia. "This happens because the flu virus injures the lungs and causes inflammation that then makes it easier for bacteria to invade the lungs and cause a very serious infection," Bocchini told CBS News. "The bacterial infection can make it hard for children to breathe, and their lungs struggle to get enough oxygen for their body." Sepsis is another complication that can lead to death. It occurs when the body overreacts to an infection. Sepsis can affect multiple organ systems, sometimes causing organ failure and resulting in death. Other rare complications from the flu that can be fatal include infection of the heart (or myocarditis) which can cause sudden death or heart failure, and infection of the brain (or encephalitis) which can lead to seizures and dangerous swelling of the brain.     Who is most at risk? Children under the age of 5, and especially those younger than 2, as well as people who are 65 and older are more likely to develop complications from flu. Also in the higher-risk group are pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, and neurologic conditions. How can you protect yourself? The best defense against the flu is to get the flu vaccine . The CDC recommends everyone age 6 months and older get a flu shot each year. "The flu vaccine is a very safe vaccine that saves lives," Bocchini said. "Studies have shown that of the children who died from the flu in the U.S. last year, 85 percent were not immunized." Although the flu vaccine doesn't guarantee that you won't get sick, doctors say it does reduce the chances, and if you do get sick it may be less severe. If you develop flu-like symptoms , such as fever, body aches and fatigue, and you are at high risk for complications from the flu, it is important to see your doctor to ask if you should receive an antiviral medication such as Tamiflu (also available as generic oseltamivir), Relenza or Rapivab. "There are antiviral medications that can be used to shorten the duration of illness as well as to help prevent complications from the flu," Bocchini said. "Antiviral medications should be started early to have their best chance of helping." Take common-sense precautions to avoid exposure to the flu virus, such as washing your hands frequently and staying away from people who are sick. Stay home if you have flu-like symptoms until at least 24 hours after the fever is gone. When to seek emergency medical attention When the flu becomes severe, some people may need immediate medical attention to prevent further complications. "Sometimes people will need to go to the emergency room to see a doctor right away due to the flu virus," Bocchini said. "It is very important to know the signs and symptoms that indicate when someone is very sick from the flu and needs help right away." According to the CDC, emergency warning signs in children include: Fast      breathing or trouble breathing Bluish      skin color Not      drinking enough fluids Not      waking up or not interacting Being      so irritable that the child does not want to be held Flu-like      symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough Fever      with a rash In adults, emergency warning signs from flu may present as: Difficulty      breathing or shortness of breath Pain      or pressure in the chest or abdomen Sudden      dizziness Confusion Severe      or persistent vomiting Flu-like      symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worse cough If you or your child have these symptoms, it is important to get medical treatment right away.   © 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

"The typical estimate is 36,000 [deaths] a year in the United States," reports NBC, citing the Centers for Disease Control. "Somewhere between 4,000 and 8,000 Canadians a year die of influenza and its related complications, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada," the Globe and Mail says, adding that "Those numbers are controversial because they are estimates."       "Controversial" is an understatement, and not just in Canada, and not just because the numbers are estimates. The numbers differ wildly from the sober tallies recorded on death certificates -- by law every certificate must show a cause -- and reported by the official agencies that collect and keep vital statistics.       According to the National Vital Statistics System in the U.S., for example, annual flu deaths in 2010 amounted to just 500 per year -- fewer than deaths from ulcers (2,977), hernias (1,832) and pregnancy and childbirth (825), and a far cry from the big killers such as heart disease (597,689) and cancers (574,743). The story is similar in Canada, where unlikely killers likewise dwarf Statistics Canada's count of flu deaths.       Even that 500 figure for the U.S. could be too high, according to analyses in authoritative journals such as the American Journal of Public Health and the British Medical Journal. Only about 15-20 per cent of people who come down with flu-like symptoms have the influenza virus -- the other 80-85 per cent actually caught rhinovirus or other germs that are indistinguishable from the true flu without laboratory tests, which are rarely done. In 2001, a year in which death certificates listed 257 Americans as having died of flu, only 18 were positively identified as true flus. The other 239 were simply assumed to be flus and most likely had few true flus among them.       "U.S. data on influenza deaths are a mess," states a 2005 article in the British Medical Journal entitled " Are U.S. flu death figures more PR than science? " This article takes issue with the 36,000 flu-death figure commonly claimed, and with describing "influenza/pneumonia" as the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S.  "But why are flu and pneumonia bundled together?" the article asks. "Is the relationship so strong or unique to warrant characterizing them as a single cause of death?"  The article's answer is no. Most pneumonia deaths are unrelated to influenza. For example, "stomach acid suppressing drugs are associated with a higher risk of community-acquired pneumonia, but such drugs and pneumonia are not compiled as a single statistic," explained Dr. David Rosenthal, director of Harvard University Health Services. "People don't necessarily die, per se, of the [flu] virus -- the viraemia. What they die of is a secondary pneumonia."  Pneumonia, according to the American Lung Association, has more than 30 different causes , influenza being but one of them. The CDC itself acknowledges the slim relationship, saying "only a small proportion of deaths... only 8.5 per cent of all pneumonia and influenza deaths [are] influenza-related."  Because death certificates belie claims of numerous flu deaths, CDC enlisted computer models to arrive at its 36,000 flu-death estimate. But even here it needed to bend conventional medical terminology to arrive at compelling death numbers.  "Cause-of-death statistics are based solely on the underlying cause of death [internationally defined] as 'the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death,'" explains the National Center for Health Statistics. Because the flu was rarely an "underlying cause of death," the CDC created the sound-alike term, "influenza-associated death."  Using this new, loose definition, CDC's computer models could tally people who died of a heart ailment or other causes after having the flu. As William Thompson of the CDC's National Immunization Program admitted, influenza-associated mortality is "a statistical association ...  I don't know that we would say that it's the underlying cause of death."  The CDC's decision to play up flu deaths dates back a decade, when it realized the public wasn't following its advice on the flu vaccine. During the 2003 flu season "the manufacturers were telling us that they weren't receiving a lot of orders for vaccine,"Dr. Glen Nowak, associate director for communications at CDC's National Immunization Program, told National Public Radio. "It really did look like we needed to do something to encourage people to get a flu shot."  The CDC's response was its " Seven-Step 'Recipe ' for Generating Interest in, and Demand for, Flu (or any other) Vaccination," a slide show Nowak presented at the 2004 National Influenza Vaccine Summit.  Here is the "Recipe that fosters influenza vaccine interest and demand," in the truncated language that appears on his slides: "Medical experts and public health authorities [should] publicly (e.g. via media) state concern and alarm (and predict dire outcomes) - and urge influenza vaccination." This recipe, his slide show indicated, would result in "Significant media interest and attention ... in terms that motivate behavior (e.g. as 'very severe,' 'more severe than last or past years,' 'deadly')." Other emotive recommendations included fostering "the perception that many people are susceptible to a bad case of influenza" and "Visible/tangible examples of the seriousness of the illness (e.g., pictures of children, families of those affected coming forward) and people getting vaccinated (the first to motivate, the latter to reinforce)."  The CDC unabashedly decided to create a mass market for the flu vaccine by enlisting the media into panicking the public. An obedient and unquestioning media obliged by hyping the numbers, and 10 years later it is obliging still.  ALSO ON HUFFPOST:         Do I Have The Flu?

By Macaela Mackenzie  |  Jan 12, 2018      Photo: GolubaPhoto / Shutterstock Can you really die from the flu if you're healthy? Unfortunately, as a recent tragic case shows, the answer is yes. Kyle Baughman, a 21-year-old bodybuilder from Pennsylvania, was otherwise healthy when he got the flu, reports local news station WXPI . What started as an innocent runny nose, cough, and fever on December 23 landed him in the ER four days later—with a worsening cough and rising fever. A day later, Baughman died from organ failure and septic shock caused by the flu. (Related: Is It the Flu, a Cold, or Winter Allergies? ) Dying from flu complications happens more often than you think. According to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , every year up to 650,000 people around the world die from respiratory complications of the flu. While most of these deaths occur among the elderly or infants and people in poor countries, the death of a healthy 21-year-old bodybuilder isn't unheard of, says Darria Long Gillespie, M.D. , an ER physician and head of clinical strategy at Sharecare. "There are deaths in healthy people every single year, and it's an important example of just how tragic and deadly the flu virus can be." Still, cases like this aren't a reason to panic at the slightest cough. "You don't need to rush to the ER at the first sign of fever or body aches," says Peter Shearer, M.D., director of the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. "But if your symptoms or fever are getting worse, you should be evaluated." If you're starting to have flu symptoms (a runny nose, cough, fever above 102°F, body aches), see your primary care doctor to get started on Tamiflu, which is an antiviral treatment that can help reduce the severity of the flu. "It's important to get that early, within the first 48 hours," says Dr. Shearer. The best thing you can do to prevent serious complications from the flu is to get your flu shot. Yes, the vaccine varies in effectiveness from year to year, but you still need it. (So far, CDC estimates predict the 2017 vaccine is about 39 percent effective, which is less effective than previous years due to a particularly nasty strain of the virus going around this year. Get your flu shot anyway!) "Even though the flu vaccine is not 100 percent effective, it drastically reduces your chances of death and complications," says Dr. Gillespie. "Studies suggest that among people who die from the flu, anywhere from 75 to 95 percent of them were not vaccinated. The flu vaccine is a crucial tool in protecting all of us from the flu and its complications." That said, the vaccine may not have prevented this tragic death. "Even if someone does everything right, the nature of the flu virus is that it can cause severe, deadly complications, that no one could have foreseen or prevented," says Dr. Gillespie. If you do catch the flu, the most important thing you can do is rest up, says Dr. Gillespie. "The flu strains are particularly severe this year, and your body needs to rest, not tax itself," she says. Secondly, stay home. "Whole communities need to take care of each other when there's an outbreak like this," says Dr. Shearer. In other words, call in sick. Even if you think you can muscle through it, someone you pass the virus to might not be able to. Most people will feel better on their own with lots of rest, fluids, and cough medicine, says Dr. Gillespie. "If you have chronic illnesses such as asthma, COPD, or other chronic conditions, you may want to talk with your doctor about antiviral medications. If you experience shortness of breath, confusion, seizures, or lethargy or confusion, then seek care in the ER."
