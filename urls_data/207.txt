January 22, 2018 at 6:00 pm       Filed Under: Eagles vs Patriots , Eagles vs Vikings , Local TV     PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — All season long we’ve been talking about the odds of making it to the big game since Carson Wentz went down. Those odds haven’t been great to say the least. But in two weeks it will be Eagles, Patriots for the Lombardi trophy.  Heading to the Super Bowl against Tom Brady and the Patriots the Eagles are still–statistically speaking–the underdogs.  “Right now it looks like they have about a 35 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl,” said George Diemer, with Temple’s School of Sport, Tourism and Hospitality Management.  Eagles Fan Who Collided With Pole In Subway Is OK  That means the Patriots at 65 percent, statistically at least the favorites at taking home another Vince Lombardi trophy.  But Diemer says the odds are out on February 4.  “Anything can happen in one game. If you’re an NFL fan and you’ve watched enough games in enough years, you can definitely say any given Sunday,” said Diemer.

A team that had toiled in relative mediocrity for years, suddenly the best team in the NFC. With sophomore sensation Carson Wentz performing at an MVP level, everything was roses in the City of Brotherly Love. Then Wentz went down. However, the Eagles have changed on the fly. Changing from the expected NFC champions to underdogs , the team strolled to Super Bowl 52 and a date with the New England Patriots. Once again, the Eagles find themselves as underdogs, opening at +6 at many sportsbooks . However, the Eagles are still one of the best teams in football – and I argue the best. If you need convincing, here are three reasons why the Philadelphia Eagles will win Super Bowl 52. Foles Is Actually Good (For The Eagles Offense) More than a few Eagles fans and pundits threw the baby out with the bathwater when Carson Wentz got hurt. After all, the last time we saw significant starting time from backup quarterback Nick Foles was a train wreck of a season with the then St. Louis Rams in 2015. However, people did not look beyond the numbers. Let’s face it: Jeff Fisher’s offense with the Rams was genuinely one of the worst things in modern football history. He was completely clueless about how to develop his scheme around his talent. And Foles has talent. I’m not saying he is ever going to reach the heights of his ridiculous Pro Bowl season under Chip Kelly but that offense understood Foles. Unlike many backups in the league, Foles wants to heave the ball. The sixth-year quarterback has a cannon and loves showing it off. He could not have found a better home than Doug Pederson’s aggressive offense. Foles has thrown seven touchdowns this season. Those seven scores have gone for an average of 21 yards per catch. That explosive playmaking should worry a Patriots secondary that ranked in the bottom third in the NFL in passing yards allowed and yards per completion. Foles is going to take his shots. He’s not going to hit all of them but he is going to complete enough of those big plays to give the Eagles the offense they need to beat the Patriots. Third-Down Offense One of the major factors to beating the Patriots is keeping Tom Brady off the field. Yeah, it sounds trite but the less time arguably the greatest quarterback in history is on the field, the better for the Eagles. Luckily, their offense has proven adept at moving the chains. The reason why is because of Philly’s fantastic third-down offense. The Eagles ranked third in the NFL in third-down conversion percentage during the regular season (43.6 percent) but have been nearly unstoppable in the playoffs, going a ridiculous 16-for-27 (59.3 percent). The Eagles went 10-for-14 while averaging 10.6 yards per play on third down against the Minnesota Vikings. To put it into perspective, the Eagles went 10-for-14 while averaging 10.6 yards per play on third down against the Minnesota Vikings – a team that owned the best third-down defense in history . Yes, the Patriots have been good on third-down defense during the postseason but opposition plays a significant part. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans ranked 19th and 21st  in the NFL in third-down conversion during the regular season – two of the bottom three to make the playoffs. The Eagles can – and will – succeed on third down. Third-down success equals longer drives, which equals less Brady, which equals victory for the Eagles. The Eagles Have The Best Defensive Line In Football But what happens when Brady is on the field? Well, the 40-year-old will need to compete against the best defensive line in football. Sure, a lot of people wanted to anoint “Sacksonville” the best but the Eagles’ depth and versatility make them the most dangerous defensive front in the league. The defensive line allowed the fewest rushing yards in the NFL and the least amount of time to opposing quarterbacks in the pocket – while their constant pressure helped Philly record the fourth-most takeaways during the regular season. What is even more impressive? The depth along the front four. Only one defensive lineman (Brandon Graham) played at least 60 percent of the team’s snaps during the regular season. That depth has kept the likes of Fletcher Cox and Vinny Curry fresh for the playoffs where defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz can set them loose on opposing offenses. This will be absolutely vital, as pressuring Brady is the key to beating the Patriots offense. Since Brady returned from his season-opening four-game suspension last season, the Patriots are 20-2 when Brady is sacked two or fewer times. For comparison’s sake, the Pats are 8-3 in that same span when Brady is sacked three or more times. Though that is still a great winning percentage, it drops from 91 percent to 72.7 percent when the defense can get after Brady. The Patriots offense has spent all season winning the war of attrition in the trenches, getting better as games go on. However, the Eagles’ fresh defensive front mixed with their depth means Philly will be bullying its way into the backfield during the Super Bowl. Despite these convincing points, Gilles Gallant disagrees and thinks the New England Patriots will win Super Bowl 52. You can check out his argument here. bet on super bowl lii here!

Super Bowl LII will end that streak, and not because the Patriots win big, but because the Eagles will win in convincing fashion. So which side of the Super Bowl line do you need to be all over? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of Patriots-Eagles you need to jump on, plus what X-factor determines the outcome, all from a Vegas legend who's 9-3 on Eagles' games. The only concerning thing about this prediction, to me, is the jinx factor. I really do believe the Eagles are a superior team to the Patriots. New England has the edge at coach -- Doug Pederson and Co. have been great and deserve credit, but Bill Belichick is Bill Belichick. Any argument to the contrary is futile. The Pats have the edge at quarterback too: sorry, Nick Foles, but something something Tom Brady. When you look at the rest of the roster, however -- and Pete Prisco did a great job of that here on CBSSports.com -- it's clear outside of Brady and Rob Gronkowski, still not cleared to play but set to play if you catch my drift, the Eagles have a superior roster. It mostly happens on defense and mostly on the defensive line, with Fletcher Cox, Timmy Jernigan, Brandon Graham, Vinny Curry, Chris Long and Derek Barnett forming a rotation that cannot be matched in football right now.    If the Eagles win, it will be on their strengths and their strengths are rushing the passer and pounding the rock. The Eagles are physical up front on both sides of the ball, and have similarities to the 2011 Giants team that beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Philly can send wave after wave of pass rushers, and doubling a guy like Cox creates an issue for other one-on-one matchups. New England will need to run a ton of plays to wear out this defense, eating up tiny chunks of yardage and keeping the ball moving, waiting for a moment to strike down the field. It happened in the second half against the Falcons last year; anything goes after halftime, with Belichick coaching, because he's so good at making adjustments. But here's how I think it plays out: the Eagles utilize a heavy-pressure defense to get Brady off his spot early and minimize the ability of New England to throw down the field. Without Julian Edelman in the game, the Pats can't eat up quite as much short-yardage stuff, although Danny Amendola is a different animal in the playoffs and although Dion Lewis/James White are nice substitutions, Philly was good against pass-catching backs this year ( 10th by DVOA ). Good luck stopping Tom Brady, but this is an Eagles team that can do it based on the defensive personnel.    If that happens early -- and the Patriots have never scored an offensive point in the first quarter of a Super Bowl mind you -- the Eagles can attack offensively on their end with run-pass options the Pats could struggle to defend. Stephon Gilmore has stepped up down the stretch, but Alshon Jeffery can win a rebound battle, and Torrey Smith is a field stretcher. Nelson Agholar quietly had a tremendous season and we haven't even mentioned Zach Ertz. This is an offense capable of challenging teams down the field; I don't know if Doug Pederson will be aggressive with Nick Foles early, but I don't think he will want to play it conservatively either. Getting Foles established early and taking some shots down the field has been a focus this postseason, because it gives him a comfort level in the pocket and keeps defenses honest. Let him wing one to Smith down the sideline if he gets a good coverage look. So let's say the Eagles get up, which is not inconceivable for a Super Bowl involving the Patriots. Perhaps you remember 28-3? The difference in this Eagles team and a squad like last year's Falcons is Philly is built to play from ahead. Lots of teams are better when they're winning, but the Eagles specific strengths allow them to put teams away. This was the case before Carson Wentz became an MVP candidate, during the MVP stretch and even when Wentz got hurt. We saw it last week in the NFC Championship Game against the Vikings -- Philly mauled up front on defense, got pressure on Case Keenum, created a turnover, got a lead and then got aggressive on offense. When they had the lead, Pederson remained aggressive, but he also leaned on his downhill run game, featuring two bruising, physical backs in Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount, to punish the opponents, melt clock and shorten the game. With a lead, the defensive line can pin its ears back and get after a quarterback who will be passing on more plays than not. It's not a new formula, it just happens to be a formula that works very well with the construction of this Eagles roster.    And I think it's going to work in the Super Bowl. Betting against the Pats isn't a profitable endeavor, and Lord knows I've been wrong about some Super Bowl outcomes before ( although last year's Falcons 28, Patriots 27 call was pretty close ...). The Eagles could come out and be overmatched. Brady could play another Game of His Life™ en route to giving the Patriots another Super Bowl. He tends to show up on the biggest stage and picking him to lose typically backfires. Philly has weaknesses the Patriots can expose. This just feels like the strengths are going to be a problem for New England and we could see Philly manage to run away with Super Bowl LII.

Before the season, it was inevitable that they'd make it back to the Super Bowl. When they went to Pittsburgh with the AFC's top seed on the line , it was inevitable that they'd beat the Steelers . When ESPN dropped that bombshell story about the internal strife consuming the Patriots' facility, it was inevitable that they'd respond by never losing again. When they faced the Titans in their first playoff game, it was inevitable that they'd destroy their inferior foe . When they trailed the Jaguars by 10 points in the fourth quarter of the AFC title game, it was inevitable that Tom Brady would bring them back from the brink.  The Super Bowl is inevitable. When the Patriots face the Eagles with the Lombardi Trophy on the line, their victory is inevitable. The Patriots are 4.5-point favorites. They're going up against a Nick Foles-quarterbacked offense. Brady has as many Super Bowl starts as the entire Eagles' roster combined.  Rob Gronkowski is healthy. Carson Wentz still isn't. So which side of the Super Bowl line do you need to be all over? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of Patriots-Eagles you need to jump on, plus what X-factor determines the outcome, all from a Vegas legend who's 9-3 on Eagles' games. For me, this game boils down to one question: Can the Eagles consistently hit and harass Brady and as a result, make him human? Let's start with first part of the question: Can the Eagles hit and harass Brady? Definitely.    According to PFF, the Eagles have generated pressure at a stupidly high rate of 41.9 percent even though they've blitzed only 22.6 percent of the time (league average is 29.3 percent). The rush comes from everywhere. Defensive end Brandon Graham leads the team with 9.5 sacks, defensive ends Chris Long and Derek Barnett each have five sacks apiece while defensive end Vinny Curry has grabbed three sacks. Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox has registered 5.5 sacks. In their divisional round win over the Falcons , the Eagles pressured Matt Ryan 41.5 percent of the time. In their dominant NFC title game win over the Vikings , they sacked Case Keenum only once, but pressured him on almost half of his dropbacks (24 of 50), according to PFF. There's no question the Eagles have the players to get after Brady. But the answer to the second part of the question -- can they make Brady human? -- is probably a no. Brady is at his worst under pressure, but he's not bad. According to PFF, Brady owns the league's highest passer rating under pressure (95.5) in the regular season and the playoffs. Against a team with one of the best pass-rushes in football (the Jaguars finished the regular season with the second-most sacks), Brady led a double-digit fourth-quarter comeback. Even against pressure, Brady's still Brady. Bad OL, 40 years of age, doesn't matter. pic.twitter.com/dSxlUjKxcb — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 You shouldn't be able to do this against pressure at the age of 40. That's how great of a season Tom Brady has had. pic.twitter.com/lvbOqh4mnd — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 REPEAT: NO PRESSURE YOU PUT ON BRADY 99.9% OF THE TIME WILL MATTER pic.twitter.com/uPEvHqQWc8 — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 The Eagles' best hope is to draw up elaborate blitzes that get to Brady, who has been at his worst this season when he's blitzed. According to PFF, Brady has an 84.0 passer rating against the blitz. But, again, it's not like Brady's some awful quarterback who crumbles against extra pass-rushers. More often than not, Brady burns the blitz because he sees it coming and already knows where the opening is in the defense.     You can't suicide blitz Brady because he'll anticipate it with the blink of an eye and beat you every time you do it to him. pic.twitter.com/Mq1dautZvG — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018   The Patriots are going to negate the Eagles' ability to get pressure by getting rid of the ball quickly to their armada of pass-catching running backs ( James White and Dion Lewis lead the way), Gronk (the most unstoppable pass-catching threat maybe ever), and reliable pass-catchers like Danny Amendola ( who is money in the playoffs, by the way ). And when Brady does get time in the pocket, he'll eviscerate a good, but not great secondary because he has the downfield threats in Gronk and Brandin Cooks (16.6 yards per catch) to do it. The point being, this Patriots offense is an unstoppable juggernaut with Brady playing the way that he is. As Broncos pass-rusher Von Miller put it, Brady "knows voodoo." This might sound overly simplistic, but I'm taking the Patriots to win because they have Brady and the Eagles have Nick Foles . The difference between them is too significant for me to ignore, especially when you factor in that Bill Belichick, the greatest coach in the history of the sport, had two weeks to gameplan for the Eagles' RPO-heavy offense. The Eagles are a great story. Getting to this point without Wentz is truly admirable. But the Patriots aren't the Falcons or the Vikings. They're a team that's in their eighth Super Bowl since 2001. They're the greatest dynasty in the history of team sports. It'll take a perfect, flawless game for the Eagles to even hang around with the Patriots. And then even if they do that, they'll still have to find a way to beat the Patriots in a close game, which is suicide. Consider how the Giants -- the only team to beat Brady in the Super Bowl -- have gotten it done: By playing flawless defense and getting crazy, impossible catches in the biggest moments of the game. The Eagles can play good defense, but even that alone won't be enough to beat the Patriots. They'll also need the bounces to bounce their way.    In that sense, the Patriots are the much safer bet. They don't need luck to win. They just need Brady to be Brady and Foles to be Foles. Before the season, I picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl: At this point, picking against the Patriots is like betting against a Jon-Daenerys alliance. The Patriots might've lost one of their dragons ( Julian Edelman ), but Tom Brady can still ride Rob Gronkowski and Brandin Cooks all the way to the Super Bowl. Of course, it helps that they have the best mastermind in the business, Bill Belichick, running the show. The Patriots have been the best team in football for the past 15 or so years and they went out and got better this year. I can't pick against them. I can't turn away from them now.

The opposing first seed, the Eagles, have the lowest odds of any team in the NFC due to the loss of Carson Wentz and a brutal 6-0 loss to the Cowboys to close out the season that people clearly haven't forgotten. The Saints earned some good faith with a solid win against the Panthers , but the Vikings remain the favorites in the NFC. The NFC sports an incredibly deep remaining field, and the AFC has the potential for a team like the Jaguars to play spoiler.

With a projection to win the conference of 52.4 percent and a 35.14 percent simulated Super Bowl win, the Patriots are the favorites by an incredibly wide margin. However, the Vikings have something to say about that. There's a nonzero chance that the Vikings will be playing three games at home this postseason, although of course the Eagles would have to lose to the Falcons. But with Case Keenum playing out of his mind all season and one of the best defenses in football, the Vikings have shown themselves to be a force to be reckoned with. The other contenders However, if the Vikings are to play another game this season, they'll have to get through the Saints. The Saints are coming off of a three-game sweep against the division rival Panthers, and they're riding high. With Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram sputtering in the wild card, the Saints went to the Drew Brees well, and it went just fine. However, the Vikings' defense is as stout as it comes, and more often than not the defense wins those battles. The Steelers are playing against the Jaguars at home, another example of an extremely potent offense facing off against a stout defense. In the AFC, no remaining teams can be overlooked, but the Titans are real longshots. The Jaguars crushed the Steelers earlier this year, hence their heightened odds, but the Patriots are largely expected to dominate Tennessee .    The Falcons and Eagles is an intriguing match-up, as the Eagles are missing their MVP candidate in Carson Wentz. The Eagles are the first seed in the NFC, but they're being given the worst odds to win the Super Bowl out of the entire conference. That's a tough pill to swallow for Eagles' fans, but the team will just have to prove people wrong as they did to close out the season. A 6-0 loss to the Cowboys in Week 17 didn't exactly inspire confidence among bettors, and they do not forget that. Mix the Eagles' slump with a Falcons' team that seemed to catch fire against the Rams , and it makes sense that the Falcons are getting the respect that they are as a sixth seed.

The rematch of 2005’s big game between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles will be played on Feb. 4. Their first championship clash resulted in the Patriots’ third Super Bowl title in four years. And with quarterback Tom Brady still at the Patriots’ helm 13 years later, it’s perhaps no surprise that the odds are in New England’s favor this time around.  The Patriots are favorites to win the 2018 Super Bowl with a 4.5 point spread, according to betting site SportsLine. But that’s not just because the Patriots have Brady, one of the top quarterbacks in NFL history and likely favorite for this season’s Most Valuable Player award. The Eagles also have a star quarterback, Carson Wentz — but he went down with a serious ligament injury in Week 14 of the regular season.      In a detailed preview of the matchup, ESPN’s Bill Barnwell wrote that, “If this were the Eagles with Carson Wentz, I’d pick them to win. They’re better than the Patriots on both sides of the line of scrimmage, and that played up when the [Atlanta] Falcons nearly upset New England last year.” The Eagles come into the game with one of the best defenses in the league — one superior to New England’s, that should be able to apply pressure on Brady. But the Eagles’ replacement quarterback, Nick Foles, may be the key decider of Super Bowl LII. As good as Foles was in the NFC Championship game against the Minnesota Vikings, he was inconsistent prior to playing one of the best games of his career, and simply is not in the same class as Brady or the man he replaced, Wentz.    But there are some who believe the Eagles could surprise the Patriots, who have shown that they are not infallible despite winning five Super Bowls over the course of Brady’s career. After all, the Patriots were down 28-3 midway through the third quarter in last year’s Super Bowl against the Falcons. Were it not for a dramatic collapse by Atlanta’s defense late in the game, the Patriots would have lost handily. And defense, again, is Philadelphia’s key strength.  “Betting against the Pats isn’t a profitable endeavor, and Lord knows I’ve been wrong about some Super Bowl outcomes before,” Will Brinson wrote for CBS Sports. “Philly has weaknesses the Patriots can expose. This just feels like the strengths are going to be a problem for New England and we could see Philly manage to run away with Super Bowl LII.” His final prediction: 28-17, Eagles.      If you happen to think the Eagles can upset the Patriots, or simply believe it’s way too close of a game to bet on an outright winner, you might consider gambling on the total score rather than the victory outcome. The Over/Under line, which bets on the combined score of both teams, is at 48.5 points, according to SportsLine. Will Super Bowl LII end up being a shootout with a higher score than that figure, or are we set for a defensive struggle that will result in fewer points? That’s for you to decide.

By  Kaleel.Weatherly    Feb  4, 2018, 10:00am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Experts think Eagles have a chance to upset Patriots      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Jerry Lai-USA TODAY Sports     Super Bowl 52 is finally here, and football fans are excited to see the New England Patriots clash against the Philadelphia Eagles . Many analysts predict that Tom Brady and the Patriots will hoist their sixth Vince Lombari Trophy, but others are convinced that the resurgent Eagles will claim their first-ever Super Bowl crown.  SB Nation's Stephen White believes the Patriots will win.   However, he did provide ways in which the Eagles could pull off the upset. White said the Eagles have to generate a rushing attack and play mistake-free football:  In this game even one turnover by the Eagles could be enough to doom them. One way or another, they have to find a way to avoid the interceptions and fumbles on offense. It would be a damn shame if their defense balls out, but the offense keeps putting them in precarious positions.  White said the Patriots would have to use tight end Rob Gronkowski as a decoy and utilize Brandon Cooks:  So I expect the Patriots to test the Eagles’ coverage by lining up in a 2x2 formation and having both the outside receiver and Gronk, as the inside receiver, to run vertical routes to get the corner and safety on that side to bail out of there. Then they can either slip a running back out to the flat to that side or have someone run a crossing route from the other side that ends up in that flat to see if Philly has fixed that issue.  It should be easy money if the Eagles still haven’t fixed it.  Our Eagles site, Bleeding Green Nation , predicts Philadelphia will cruise to victory against the Patriots.  Alexis Chassen made a bold prediction about what will transpire during this clash:  Look, this might seem crazy, but while I think the game starts off pretty slow and even on both sides, the Eagles come out of halftime with a fire under their ass and go up by a score before a late Pick-6 by the Eagles defense seals the win. THIS IS FOR PHILLY. With the momentum coming off demolishing of the Vikings in the NFC Championship , I’d expect the players for Philadelphia to be ready to run through a wall in the days leading up to the big game. As long as the defensive line can keep pressure on Tom Brady throughout the matchup (and limit the use of Gronkowski) the Eagles should be primed to keep the Patriots’ score on the low side. Nick Foles probably wont have quite the same dynamic game as he did against the Vikings, but the Patriots knowing he can throw the ball further than 30 yards should keep them honest and open up some lanes for the run game. Ultimately, I think the Eagles enact their revenge -- which at this point should be more than just bulletin board material. As long as Doug Pederson continues to be “fearless” in his play-calling, there’s no reason the Eagles don’t walk away with the first Super Bowl win in franchise history. (FINALLY!)  CBS Sports' Will Brinson thinks Philadelphia will beat the Patriots by double digits.   Brinson said the Eagles will pressure Brady so much, making the Patriots take short passes instead of deep throws:  But here’s how I think it plays out: the Eagles utilize a heavy-pressure defense to get Brady off his spot early and minimize the ability of New England to throw down the field. Without Julian Edelman in the game, the Pats can’t eat up quite as much short-yardage stuff, although Danny Amendola is a different animal in the playoffs and although Dion Lewis / James White are nice substitutions, Philly was good against pass-catching backs this year ( 10th by DVOA ).   Jared Dubin of CBS Sports doesn't agree with Brinson.   Dubin said Tom Brady will be too much for the Eagles to handle. According to Dubin, New England performs well under pressure, and Brady doesn't rarely commits turnovers:  I wound up siding with Brady and company this time around largely because his performance in pressure situations has been so much better this season than in previous years. His ability and willingness to use his running backs as outlets in the passing game has led to fewer tight-window throws down the field and more safety-valve type throws to Dion Lewis , Rex Burkhead , and James White . As a result, he’s turned the ball over with rushers in his face far less often than in the previous few seasons. So even if the Eagles’ rush hits home on Sunday, they still need Brady to make mistakes with his throws. Brady rarely makes mistakes.  ESPN's Chris Berman has the Patriots winning, 24-21 .  Philadelphia has been undervalued by oddsmakers and will be an underdog in the Super Bowl as well. I make this game Patriots -4, so the market has kind of caught up to what Philadelphia is -- and that is a more complete team than just Carson Wentz at QB. I used to believe in trends more in the past when players didn’t change teams as much, but it has to be said that the Patriots have won their Super Bowls with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick by three, three, three, four and six points -- and they lost the other two by a combined seven points. I think this will be another close game.  Fiona, The Cincinnati Zoo’s star hippopotamus, joined in on making Super Bowl predictions.  She chose the Eagles to win the big game. Now, you have to like the Eagles' chances of winning.  Eight experts at NJ.com made Super bowl predictions. Six picked Philly.   Shocking, we know. Matt Lombardo, an Eagles reporter for the online publication, said the Eagles have a "better and deeper roster" than the Patriots.  The Patriots have Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, but the Eagles have the better and deeper roster. This game is going to be won along the line of scrimmage, where the Eagles have the better offensive and defensive lines. Whether it’s unblockable All-Pro defensive tackle Fletcher Cox , who is more than capable of providing pressure up the middle against Brady or an offensive line that has an All-Pro center, All-Pro tackle and Pro Bowl guard in Jason Kelce , Lane Johnson , and Brandon Books, the Eagles have the edge. Meanwhile, Doug Pederson has done a masterful job of unlocking the keys to the Eagles ‘offense and Nick Foles’ potential via run-pass options that will put a strain on the Patriots’ defense.   At Boston.com, Chad Finn unsurprisingly sees the Patriots winning .  The more I think about it, the more convinced I become that this will be a win for the Patriots, but not a wild and dramatic win. I would not be shocked if it’s a stylistic replay of the first time the Patriots and Eagles met in the Super Bowl 13 years ago.  No matter who you vote for in this game, let's hope Super Bowl 52 adds on to the long list of great Super Bowl memories.

Eagles Opening Betting Line And Expert Picks  Jan 21, 2018, 10:04pm              Alex Kay     Contributor                  Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin              Jim Davis/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)      Super Bowl LII will be contested between the AFC’s New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFC. It’s an intriguing matchup, pitting the top seeds in each conference against one another, although the similarities end there. This contest will feature the defending champions against an upstart club making its first appearance in the NFL Playoffs since 2013. New England has been a regular fixture in the big game—making it eight times since the 2001 campaign—while Philly hasn’t been this far since 2004, when it came up just short against the Pats in Super Bowl XXXIX. That title cemented a New England dynasty, as it was the organization’s second in a row and third in four years. Interestingly enough, the Patriots are now in position to accomplish that same feat against the exact same opponent.  Oddsmakers are clearly expecting the Patriots to become the first back-to-back champion since they last accomplished it in 2003-2004, opening them as a six-point favorite over the Eagles before the line was bet down to 5.5 almost immediately (Edit 1/29 at 6:30 p.m. ET: the line is now NE -4.5) . Don’t write off Philadelphia yet, as the team has thrived as an underdog throughout the postseason. The Eagles players utilized the betting lines for both the Divisional Round and NFC Championship as motivation, embracing their underdog status by donning dog masks on the field after a win and encouraging fans to wear them to the NFC Championship Game . They’ll now face their toughest challenge yet, needing to best an opponent they’ve only won against once since the turn of the millennium.  Adam Schefter  highlighted some key storylines for the game:   It’s a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX, Eagles vs. Patriots.  It’s LeGarrette Blount and Chris Long vs their former team.  It’s the Patriots’ record 10th Super Bowl appearance vs an Eagles’ team still trying to win its first Super Bowl.  — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter)  January 22, 2018     Will Philadelphia pull off its third straight upset and finally bring a title to the City of Brotherly Love, or will the Pats add yet another Super Bowl ring to their collection by winning a fortnight from now? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com analyzed the opening line and sent along his early take on the action. Before getting to the pro Las Vegas handicapper’s prediction, take a look at the complete schedule, start time, TV info, odds and more for Super Bowl LII:            Gallery  NFL Team Values 2017   Launch Gallery  33 images        Super Bowl LII Odds and Viewing Guide  Odds updated 2/2 at 4:30 p.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Feb. 4    6:30 p.m.  New England Patriots Vs. Philadelphia Eagles (NBC)  AFC No. 1 Vs. NFC No. 1  NE -5  48      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook  Super Bowl LII Preview: New England Patriots (AFC No. 1) vs. Philadelphia Eagles (NFC No. 1)    The Patriots appeared mortal for much of the 2018 AFC Championship Game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, looking rattled by their foe’s hard-hitting, fast defense. It appeared that the Jags had finally found a way to topple this group, especially after knocking star tight end Rob Gronkowski out of the game with a concussion at the end of the first half.  Gronkowski's injury has an impact on the betting line, according to odds consultant Scott Cooley of BetDSI:   There aren’t any players other than quarterbacks that impact the spread from an oddsmaking standpoint. However, if Rob Gronkowski is not cleared for this game due to a concussion, the betting public will react and we will adjust the odds accordingly. He is certainly a big part of the offense, but we all know they can win without him.   Quarterback Tom Brady was taking a beating and it seemed that Tom Coughlin—Jacksonville’s VP of football operations and the architect of two Super Bowl wins at New England’s expense during his time head coaching the New York Giants—would get the best of this team yet again. The Jags built up a 20-10 lead with only 12 minutes left and started thinking they might be punching a ticket to Minneapolis for the first Super Bowl berth in franchise history.    As he’s found a way to do so many times before, Brady would not let that be and willed his squad to a win. Dealing with a cut on his throwing hand that dominated the headlines leading up to the game, the future Hall of Famer found his groove in the clutch and dissected the secondary precision. He finished the fourth quarter comeback having completed 9-of-14 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns—both to sure-handed wideout Danny Amendola—orchestrating his 12 th game-winning postseason drive and the 54 th of his career to lead the Pats to a 24-20 win . The 40-year-old did this all against the league’s best passing defense, a group that gave up a mere 169.9 yards per game to opposing signal-callers and allowed only 17 passing touchdowns all season.  New England head coach Bill Belichick, the other constant during New England’s unprecedented run to eight AFC titles in 17 seasons, was characteristically dry when discussing Brady’s ability to play through the hand injury on Sunday, as per NESN.com : “I mean, look, Tom did a great job and he’s a tough guy. We all know that alright? But we’re not talking about open-heart surgery.”  Brady himself admitted that the injury actually worried him leading up to the game, as per ESPN :   I thought, 'Of all the plays, my season can't end on a handoff in practice. I didn't come this far to end on a handoff…I’ve never had anything like it. I've had a couple of crazy injuries, but this was pretty crazy. I wasn't sure how I was going to do. Wednesday, Wednesday night, Thursday, I wasn't sure. Friday, gained a little confidence. Saturday, trying to figure out what we could do. Sunday, try to come out here and make it happen.   The good news is that Brady’s stitches should come out by the middle of this week, giving him plenty of time to get fully recovered before Super Bowl LII’s kickoff on February 4. He’ll need to be at 100% to help extend his unprecedented five championships as a starting QB against a tough Eagles opponent that is coming off a much more convincing win in the NFC Championship.  Philadelphia was dominant on Sunday night, obliterating the Minnesota Vikings 38-7 in a game it wasn’t expected to win after betting closed with Minnesota laying three points. Oddsmakers appeared to be onto something after the Eagles gave up a quick score on the opening drive, but the defense locked in and didn’t allow their opponent to put another point on the board after that. This thorough routing ending the Vikings’ dream of becoming the first team to ever play in a Super Bowl in their home stadium. Philly will instead travel to U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis with aspirations to win the first title in franchise history.    The Eagles are now 5.5-point underdogs for their matchup with New England in two weeks and haven’t faced odds this long all season. They outright lost and failed to cover as four-point ‘dogs against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 2, the only game it received more than three points in during the 2017 campaign and subsequent postseason. Much has changed for the Eagles since that defeat in Arrowhead Stadium, none more impactful than the team’s adjustment under center.  Backup quarterback Nick Foles took over for Carson Wentz after the second-year signal-caller tore his ACL late in Week 14 and has improbably guided his franchise back to the Super Bowl. After besting the Vikings, Foles is now 4-1 as a starter. His only loss came in a meaningless Week 17 game against the Dallas Cowboys, in which home field advantage through the playoffs was already secure.  Locking up the No. 1 seed was instrumental for the Eagles—who finished the regular season with an impressive 13-3 record, the same as New England—as the home crowd helped push the team to back-to-back upsets over the Falcons and Vikings, but the improved play of Foles was what truly propelled the team to this Super Bowl appearance. The Arizona product looked more comfortable as the playoffs went on, bettering his play in consecutive games. He started out by managing the Divisional Round game against Atlanta well, completing 76% of his passes for 246 yards, but failed to throw any touchdowns in a 15-10 victory. Foles had no issues finding the end zone on Sunday evening, torching Minnesota’s top-ranked defense for 352 yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers on 26-of-33 passing attempts. If Foles can keep it up, he has a great chance of becoming the 10th backup QB in history and first since Tom Brady in Super Bowl XXXVI to win a ring.  As prolific as their quarterback was on Sunday evening, the Eagles defense made sure a merely average outing would have sufficed. The Vikings mustered 333 yards, but weren’t able to capitalize after being forced into three critical turnovers by an opportunistic defense. Minnesota quarterback Case Keenum had only thrown one interception in his last four starts, but was picked twice and lost a fumble in the NFC Championship. The Vikings running game, which was one of the best during the regular season, was held to 70 yards on 18 carries. The Philadelphia D will need to clamp down one final time and come up with a memorable performance if it is going to stop Brady and co. from marching to a record-tying sixth Super Bowl for the franchise.

I can not wait.  — Peter Burns (@PeterBurnsESPN) January 22, 2018   Early Super Bowl LII Expert Prediction    Price’s Take: This Super Bowl matchup is an interesting one. Most people expected the Pats to be here as they had the best odds to win it all right before the season started at 3-1. The Eagles were 2-1 to even make the postseason—compared to 1-15 for New England—and 35-1 to claim a title. Anyone who bet the Birds at that line is sitting on what could potentially be a very valuable ticket, but they’ll have to get past a team they’ve long struggled with to cash in.  The Eagles have only won against the Patriots in the last 15 years, beating them 35-28 in 2015. They forced Tom Brady into two interceptions and sacked him four times during the contest, while then-starter Sam Bradford came through with two touchdowns, no turnovers and only was sacked once. The keys to winning in 2018 are going be the exact same—hit Brady and avoid mistakes that New England will absolutely capitalize on—but it’s not going to be easy as much of the roster and coaching staff has turned over and the Pats offense has evolved in the years since.  The way to overcome this Pats team is to meet them in the regular season, see how Brady operates and get comfortable facing the many unique looks they throw at you when on the offensive. That’s how the New York Giants topped them in two Super Bowls, as well as how the Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos and New York Jets bested them in their other five postseason losses since the dynasty began in 2001. If you haven’t seen them, you simply aren’t prepared, as New England has never lost a game against an opponent it faces for the first time that season in the playoffs. Film just doesn't seem to cut it against New England.  The Eagles won’t go down without a fight, but they won’t be able to come through in the clutch. Brady thrives in situations where most quarterbacks would be rattled, as evidenced by his double-digit fourth quarter comebacks against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI and even this week against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Even if Philly has a lead late in the game, it’s going to be impossible to keep it if the Pats get the ball back with a chance to win in the clutch. We’ve seen it time and time again and it won’t change this year.  I like the Eagles getting 5.5, however, as New England has only won a single Super Bowl by more than five points (last year's six-point victory in overtime against the Falcons) and the contests always seems to come down to the wire. I just can’t trust Foles to lead this team to victory in crunch time, even after his big performance in the NFC Championship Game. The Patriots battle-tested, veteran-laden roster is built to win this time of year and should come through when it matters most.

January 22, 2018 at 6:00 pm       Filed Under: Eagles vs Patriots , Eagles vs Vikings , Local TV     PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — All season long we’ve been talking about the odds of making it to the big game since Carson Wentz went down. Those odds haven’t been great to say the least. But in two weeks it will be Eagles, Patriots for the Lombardi trophy.  Heading to the Super Bowl against Tom Brady and the Patriots the Eagles are still–statistically speaking–the underdogs.  “Right now it looks like they have about a 35 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl,” said George Diemer, with Temple’s School of Sport, Tourism and Hospitality Management.  Eagles Fan Who Collided With Pole In Subway Is OK  That means the Patriots at 65 percent, statistically at least the favorites at taking home another Vince Lombardi trophy.  But Diemer says the odds are out on February 4.  “Anything can happen in one game. If you’re an NFL fan and you’ve watched enough games in enough years, you can definitely say any given Sunday,” said Diemer.

A team that had toiled in relative mediocrity for years, suddenly the best team in the NFC. With sophomore sensation Carson Wentz performing at an MVP level, everything was roses in the City of Brotherly Love. Then Wentz went down. However, the Eagles have changed on the fly. Changing from the expected NFC champions to underdogs , the team strolled to Super Bowl 52 and a date with the New England Patriots. Once again, the Eagles find themselves as underdogs, opening at +6 at many sportsbooks . However, the Eagles are still one of the best teams in football – and I argue the best. If you need convincing, here are three reasons why the Philadelphia Eagles will win Super Bowl 52. Foles Is Actually Good (For The Eagles Offense) More than a few Eagles fans and pundits threw the baby out with the bathwater when Carson Wentz got hurt. After all, the last time we saw significant starting time from backup quarterback Nick Foles was a train wreck of a season with the then St. Louis Rams in 2015. However, people did not look beyond the numbers. Let’s face it: Jeff Fisher’s offense with the Rams was genuinely one of the worst things in modern football history. He was completely clueless about how to develop his scheme around his talent. And Foles has talent. I’m not saying he is ever going to reach the heights of his ridiculous Pro Bowl season under Chip Kelly but that offense understood Foles. Unlike many backups in the league, Foles wants to heave the ball. The sixth-year quarterback has a cannon and loves showing it off. He could not have found a better home than Doug Pederson’s aggressive offense. Foles has thrown seven touchdowns this season. Those seven scores have gone for an average of 21 yards per catch. That explosive playmaking should worry a Patriots secondary that ranked in the bottom third in the NFL in passing yards allowed and yards per completion. Foles is going to take his shots. He’s not going to hit all of them but he is going to complete enough of those big plays to give the Eagles the offense they need to beat the Patriots. Third-Down Offense One of the major factors to beating the Patriots is keeping Tom Brady off the field. Yeah, it sounds trite but the less time arguably the greatest quarterback in history is on the field, the better for the Eagles. Luckily, their offense has proven adept at moving the chains. The reason why is because of Philly’s fantastic third-down offense. The Eagles ranked third in the NFL in third-down conversion percentage during the regular season (43.6 percent) but have been nearly unstoppable in the playoffs, going a ridiculous 16-for-27 (59.3 percent). The Eagles went 10-for-14 while averaging 10.6 yards per play on third down against the Minnesota Vikings. To put it into perspective, the Eagles went 10-for-14 while averaging 10.6 yards per play on third down against the Minnesota Vikings – a team that owned the best third-down defense in history . Yes, the Patriots have been good on third-down defense during the postseason but opposition plays a significant part. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans ranked 19th and 21st  in the NFL in third-down conversion during the regular season – two of the bottom three to make the playoffs. The Eagles can – and will – succeed on third down. Third-down success equals longer drives, which equals less Brady, which equals victory for the Eagles. The Eagles Have The Best Defensive Line In Football But what happens when Brady is on the field? Well, the 40-year-old will need to compete against the best defensive line in football. Sure, a lot of people wanted to anoint “Sacksonville” the best but the Eagles’ depth and versatility make them the most dangerous defensive front in the league. The defensive line allowed the fewest rushing yards in the NFL and the least amount of time to opposing quarterbacks in the pocket – while their constant pressure helped Philly record the fourth-most takeaways during the regular season. What is even more impressive? The depth along the front four. Only one defensive lineman (Brandon Graham) played at least 60 percent of the team’s snaps during the regular season. That depth has kept the likes of Fletcher Cox and Vinny Curry fresh for the playoffs where defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz can set them loose on opposing offenses. This will be absolutely vital, as pressuring Brady is the key to beating the Patriots offense. Since Brady returned from his season-opening four-game suspension last season, the Patriots are 20-2 when Brady is sacked two or fewer times. For comparison’s sake, the Pats are 8-3 in that same span when Brady is sacked three or more times. Though that is still a great winning percentage, it drops from 91 percent to 72.7 percent when the defense can get after Brady. The Patriots offense has spent all season winning the war of attrition in the trenches, getting better as games go on. However, the Eagles’ fresh defensive front mixed with their depth means Philly will be bullying its way into the backfield during the Super Bowl. Despite these convincing points, Gilles Gallant disagrees and thinks the New England Patriots will win Super Bowl 52. You can check out his argument here. bet on super bowl lii here!

Super Bowl LII will end that streak, and not because the Patriots win big, but because the Eagles will win in convincing fashion. So which side of the Super Bowl line do you need to be all over? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of Patriots-Eagles you need to jump on, plus what X-factor determines the outcome, all from a Vegas legend who's 9-3 on Eagles' games. The only concerning thing about this prediction, to me, is the jinx factor. I really do believe the Eagles are a superior team to the Patriots. New England has the edge at coach -- Doug Pederson and Co. have been great and deserve credit, but Bill Belichick is Bill Belichick. Any argument to the contrary is futile. The Pats have the edge at quarterback too: sorry, Nick Foles, but something something Tom Brady. When you look at the rest of the roster, however -- and Pete Prisco did a great job of that here on CBSSports.com -- it's clear outside of Brady and Rob Gronkowski, still not cleared to play but set to play if you catch my drift, the Eagles have a superior roster. It mostly happens on defense and mostly on the defensive line, with Fletcher Cox, Timmy Jernigan, Brandon Graham, Vinny Curry, Chris Long and Derek Barnett forming a rotation that cannot be matched in football right now.    If the Eagles win, it will be on their strengths and their strengths are rushing the passer and pounding the rock. The Eagles are physical up front on both sides of the ball, and have similarities to the 2011 Giants team that beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Philly can send wave after wave of pass rushers, and doubling a guy like Cox creates an issue for other one-on-one matchups. New England will need to run a ton of plays to wear out this defense, eating up tiny chunks of yardage and keeping the ball moving, waiting for a moment to strike down the field. It happened in the second half against the Falcons last year; anything goes after halftime, with Belichick coaching, because he's so good at making adjustments. But here's how I think it plays out: the Eagles utilize a heavy-pressure defense to get Brady off his spot early and minimize the ability of New England to throw down the field. Without Julian Edelman in the game, the Pats can't eat up quite as much short-yardage stuff, although Danny Amendola is a different animal in the playoffs and although Dion Lewis/James White are nice substitutions, Philly was good against pass-catching backs this year ( 10th by DVOA ). Good luck stopping Tom Brady, but this is an Eagles team that can do it based on the defensive personnel.    If that happens early -- and the Patriots have never scored an offensive point in the first quarter of a Super Bowl mind you -- the Eagles can attack offensively on their end with run-pass options the Pats could struggle to defend. Stephon Gilmore has stepped up down the stretch, but Alshon Jeffery can win a rebound battle, and Torrey Smith is a field stretcher. Nelson Agholar quietly had a tremendous season and we haven't even mentioned Zach Ertz. This is an offense capable of challenging teams down the field; I don't know if Doug Pederson will be aggressive with Nick Foles early, but I don't think he will want to play it conservatively either. Getting Foles established early and taking some shots down the field has been a focus this postseason, because it gives him a comfort level in the pocket and keeps defenses honest. Let him wing one to Smith down the sideline if he gets a good coverage look. So let's say the Eagles get up, which is not inconceivable for a Super Bowl involving the Patriots. Perhaps you remember 28-3? The difference in this Eagles team and a squad like last year's Falcons is Philly is built to play from ahead. Lots of teams are better when they're winning, but the Eagles specific strengths allow them to put teams away. This was the case before Carson Wentz became an MVP candidate, during the MVP stretch and even when Wentz got hurt. We saw it last week in the NFC Championship Game against the Vikings -- Philly mauled up front on defense, got pressure on Case Keenum, created a turnover, got a lead and then got aggressive on offense. When they had the lead, Pederson remained aggressive, but he also leaned on his downhill run game, featuring two bruising, physical backs in Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount, to punish the opponents, melt clock and shorten the game. With a lead, the defensive line can pin its ears back and get after a quarterback who will be passing on more plays than not. It's not a new formula, it just happens to be a formula that works very well with the construction of this Eagles roster.    And I think it's going to work in the Super Bowl. Betting against the Pats isn't a profitable endeavor, and Lord knows I've been wrong about some Super Bowl outcomes before ( although last year's Falcons 28, Patriots 27 call was pretty close ...). The Eagles could come out and be overmatched. Brady could play another Game of His Life™ en route to giving the Patriots another Super Bowl. He tends to show up on the biggest stage and picking him to lose typically backfires. Philly has weaknesses the Patriots can expose. This just feels like the strengths are going to be a problem for New England and we could see Philly manage to run away with Super Bowl LII.

Before the season, it was inevitable that they'd make it back to the Super Bowl. When they went to Pittsburgh with the AFC's top seed on the line , it was inevitable that they'd beat the Steelers . When ESPN dropped that bombshell story about the internal strife consuming the Patriots' facility, it was inevitable that they'd respond by never losing again. When they faced the Titans in their first playoff game, it was inevitable that they'd destroy their inferior foe . When they trailed the Jaguars by 10 points in the fourth quarter of the AFC title game, it was inevitable that Tom Brady would bring them back from the brink.  The Super Bowl is inevitable. When the Patriots face the Eagles with the Lombardi Trophy on the line, their victory is inevitable. The Patriots are 4.5-point favorites. They're going up against a Nick Foles-quarterbacked offense. Brady has as many Super Bowl starts as the entire Eagles' roster combined.  Rob Gronkowski is healthy. Carson Wentz still isn't. So which side of the Super Bowl line do you need to be all over? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of Patriots-Eagles you need to jump on, plus what X-factor determines the outcome, all from a Vegas legend who's 9-3 on Eagles' games. For me, this game boils down to one question: Can the Eagles consistently hit and harass Brady and as a result, make him human? Let's start with first part of the question: Can the Eagles hit and harass Brady? Definitely.    According to PFF, the Eagles have generated pressure at a stupidly high rate of 41.9 percent even though they've blitzed only 22.6 percent of the time (league average is 29.3 percent). The rush comes from everywhere. Defensive end Brandon Graham leads the team with 9.5 sacks, defensive ends Chris Long and Derek Barnett each have five sacks apiece while defensive end Vinny Curry has grabbed three sacks. Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox has registered 5.5 sacks. In their divisional round win over the Falcons , the Eagles pressured Matt Ryan 41.5 percent of the time. In their dominant NFC title game win over the Vikings , they sacked Case Keenum only once, but pressured him on almost half of his dropbacks (24 of 50), according to PFF. There's no question the Eagles have the players to get after Brady. But the answer to the second part of the question -- can they make Brady human? -- is probably a no. Brady is at his worst under pressure, but he's not bad. According to PFF, Brady owns the league's highest passer rating under pressure (95.5) in the regular season and the playoffs. Against a team with one of the best pass-rushes in football (the Jaguars finished the regular season with the second-most sacks), Brady led a double-digit fourth-quarter comeback. Even against pressure, Brady's still Brady. Bad OL, 40 years of age, doesn't matter. pic.twitter.com/dSxlUjKxcb — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 You shouldn't be able to do this against pressure at the age of 40. That's how great of a season Tom Brady has had. pic.twitter.com/lvbOqh4mnd — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 REPEAT: NO PRESSURE YOU PUT ON BRADY 99.9% OF THE TIME WILL MATTER pic.twitter.com/uPEvHqQWc8 — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 The Eagles' best hope is to draw up elaborate blitzes that get to Brady, who has been at his worst this season when he's blitzed. According to PFF, Brady has an 84.0 passer rating against the blitz. But, again, it's not like Brady's some awful quarterback who crumbles against extra pass-rushers. More often than not, Brady burns the blitz because he sees it coming and already knows where the opening is in the defense.     You can't suicide blitz Brady because he'll anticipate it with the blink of an eye and beat you every time you do it to him. pic.twitter.com/Mq1dautZvG — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018   The Patriots are going to negate the Eagles' ability to get pressure by getting rid of the ball quickly to their armada of pass-catching running backs ( James White and Dion Lewis lead the way), Gronk (the most unstoppable pass-catching threat maybe ever), and reliable pass-catchers like Danny Amendola ( who is money in the playoffs, by the way ). And when Brady does get time in the pocket, he'll eviscerate a good, but not great secondary because he has the downfield threats in Gronk and Brandin Cooks (16.6 yards per catch) to do it. The point being, this Patriots offense is an unstoppable juggernaut with Brady playing the way that he is. As Broncos pass-rusher Von Miller put it, Brady "knows voodoo." This might sound overly simplistic, but I'm taking the Patriots to win because they have Brady and the Eagles have Nick Foles . The difference between them is too significant for me to ignore, especially when you factor in that Bill Belichick, the greatest coach in the history of the sport, had two weeks to gameplan for the Eagles' RPO-heavy offense. The Eagles are a great story. Getting to this point without Wentz is truly admirable. But the Patriots aren't the Falcons or the Vikings. They're a team that's in their eighth Super Bowl since 2001. They're the greatest dynasty in the history of team sports. It'll take a perfect, flawless game for the Eagles to even hang around with the Patriots. And then even if they do that, they'll still have to find a way to beat the Patriots in a close game, which is suicide. Consider how the Giants -- the only team to beat Brady in the Super Bowl -- have gotten it done: By playing flawless defense and getting crazy, impossible catches in the biggest moments of the game. The Eagles can play good defense, but even that alone won't be enough to beat the Patriots. They'll also need the bounces to bounce their way.    In that sense, the Patriots are the much safer bet. They don't need luck to win. They just need Brady to be Brady and Foles to be Foles. Before the season, I picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl: At this point, picking against the Patriots is like betting against a Jon-Daenerys alliance. The Patriots might've lost one of their dragons ( Julian Edelman ), but Tom Brady can still ride Rob Gronkowski and Brandin Cooks all the way to the Super Bowl. Of course, it helps that they have the best mastermind in the business, Bill Belichick, running the show. The Patriots have been the best team in football for the past 15 or so years and they went out and got better this year. I can't pick against them. I can't turn away from them now.

The opposing first seed, the Eagles, have the lowest odds of any team in the NFC due to the loss of Carson Wentz and a brutal 6-0 loss to the Cowboys to close out the season that people clearly haven't forgotten. The Saints earned some good faith with a solid win against the Panthers , but the Vikings remain the favorites in the NFC. The NFC sports an incredibly deep remaining field, and the AFC has the potential for a team like the Jaguars to play spoiler. Super Bowl LII odds Team Vegas SB odds SB% Vegas conference odds CONF% New England Patriots 8/5 35.14% 4/9 52.40% Minnesota Vikings 3/1 15.11% 11/10 33.61% Pittsburgh Steelers 5/1 13.87% 9/4 25.48% New Orleans Saints 6/1 8.57% 13/5 21.04% Atlanta Falcons 8/1 7.15% 4/1 20.29% Philadelphia Eagles 14/1 9.73% 5/1 25.05% Jacksonville Jaguars 20/1 7.83% 10/1 15.49% Tennessee Titans 80/1 2.59% 35/1 6.63% The favorites After taking a week off, the Patriots are back in action against the Titans as heavy favorites, both in that game and the Super Bowl betting. With a projection to win the conference of 52.4 percent and a 35.14 percent simulated Super Bowl win, the Patriots are the favorites by an incredibly wide margin. However, the Vikings have something to say about that. There's a nonzero chance that the Vikings will be playing three games at home this postseason, although of course the Eagles would have to lose to the Falcons. But with Case Keenum playing out of his mind all season and one of the best defenses in football, the Vikings have shown themselves to be a force to be reckoned with. The other contenders However, if the Vikings are to play another game this season, they'll have to get through the Saints. The Saints are coming off of a three-game sweep against the division rival Panthers, and they're riding high. With Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram sputtering in the wild card, the Saints went to the Drew Brees well, and it went just fine. However, the Vikings' defense is as stout as it comes, and more often than not the defense wins those battles. The Steelers are playing against the Jaguars at home, another example of an extremely potent offense facing off against a stout defense. In the AFC, no remaining teams can be overlooked, but the Titans are real longshots. The Jaguars crushed the Steelers earlier this year, hence their heightened odds, but the Patriots are largely expected to dominate Tennessee .    The Falcons and Eagles is an intriguing match-up, as the Eagles are missing their MVP candidate in Carson Wentz. The Eagles are the first seed in the NFC, but they're being given the worst odds to win the Super Bowl out of the entire conference. That's a tough pill to swallow for Eagles' fans, but the team will just have to prove people wrong as they did to close out the season. A 6-0 loss to the Cowboys in Week 17 didn't exactly inspire confidence among bettors, and they do not forget that. Mix the Eagles' slump with a Falcons' team that seemed to catch fire against the Rams , and it makes sense that the Falcons are getting the respect that they are as a sixth seed.

The rematch of 2005’s big game between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles will be played on Feb. 4. Their first championship clash resulted in the Patriots’ third Super Bowl title in four years. And with quarterback Tom Brady still at the Patriots’ helm 13 years later, it’s perhaps no surprise that the odds are in New England’s favor this time around.  The Patriots are favorites to win the 2018 Super Bowl with a 4.5 point spread, according to betting site SportsLine. But that’s not just because the Patriots have Brady, one of the top quarterbacks in NFL history and likely favorite for this season’s Most Valuable Player award. The Eagles also have a star quarterback, Carson Wentz — but he went down with a serious ligament injury in Week 14 of the regular season.      In a detailed preview of the matchup, ESPN’s Bill Barnwell wrote that, “If this were the Eagles with Carson Wentz, I’d pick them to win. They’re better than the Patriots on both sides of the line of scrimmage, and that played up when the [Atlanta] Falcons nearly upset New England last year.” The Eagles come into the game with one of the best defenses in the league — one superior to New England’s, that should be able to apply pressure on Brady. But the Eagles’ replacement quarterback, Nick Foles, may be the key decider of Super Bowl LII. As good as Foles was in the NFC Championship game against the Minnesota Vikings, he was inconsistent prior to playing one of the best games of his career, and simply is not in the same class as Brady or the man he replaced, Wentz.    But there are some who believe the Eagles could surprise the Patriots, who have shown that they are not infallible despite winning five Super Bowls over the course of Brady’s career. After all, the Patriots were down 28-3 midway through the third quarter in last year’s Super Bowl against the Falcons. Were it not for a dramatic collapse by Atlanta’s defense late in the game, the Patriots would have lost handily. And defense, again, is Philadelphia’s key strength.  “Betting against the Pats isn’t a profitable endeavor, and Lord knows I’ve been wrong about some Super Bowl outcomes before,” Will Brinson wrote for CBS Sports. “Philly has weaknesses the Patriots can expose. This just feels like the strengths are going to be a problem for New England and we could see Philly manage to run away with Super Bowl LII.” His final prediction: 28-17, Eagles.      If you happen to think the Eagles can upset the Patriots, or simply believe it’s way too close of a game to bet on an outright winner, you might consider gambling on the total score rather than the victory outcome. The Over/Under line, which bets on the combined score of both teams, is at 48.5 points, according to SportsLine. Will Super Bowl LII end up being a shootout with a higher score than that figure, or are we set for a defensive struggle that will result in fewer points? That’s for you to decide.

By  Kaleel.Weatherly    Feb  4, 2018, 10:00am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Experts think Eagles have a chance to upset Patriots      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Jerry Lai-USA TODAY Sports     Super Bowl 52 is finally here, and football fans are excited to see the New England Patriots clash against the Philadelphia Eagles . Many analysts predict that Tom Brady and the Patriots will hoist their sixth Vince Lombari Trophy, but others are convinced that the resurgent Eagles will claim their first-ever Super Bowl crown.  SB Nation's Stephen White believes the Patriots will win.   However, he did provide ways in which the Eagles could pull off the upset. White said the Eagles have to generate a rushing attack and play mistake-free football:  In this game even one turnover by the Eagles could be enough to doom them. One way or another, they have to find a way to avoid the interceptions and fumbles on offense. It would be a damn shame if their defense balls out, but the offense keeps putting them in precarious positions.  White said the Patriots would have to use tight end Rob Gronkowski as a decoy and utilize Brandon Cooks:  So I expect the Patriots to test the Eagles’ coverage by lining up in a 2x2 formation and having both the outside receiver and Gronk, as the inside receiver, to run vertical routes to get the corner and safety on that side to bail out of there. Then they can either slip a running back out to the flat to that side or have someone run a crossing route from the other side that ends up in that flat to see if Philly has fixed that issue.  It should be easy money if the Eagles still haven’t fixed it.  Our Eagles site, Bleeding Green Nation , predicts Philadelphia will cruise to victory against the Patriots.  Alexis Chassen made a bold prediction about what will transpire during this clash:  Look, this might seem crazy, but while I think the game starts off pretty slow and even on both sides, the Eagles come out of halftime with a fire under their ass and go up by a score before a late Pick-6 by the Eagles defense seals the win. THIS IS FOR PHILLY. With the momentum coming off demolishing of the Vikings in the NFC Championship , I’d expect the players for Philadelphia to be ready to run through a wall in the days leading up to the big game. As long as the defensive line can keep pressure on Tom Brady throughout the matchup (and limit the use of Gronkowski) the Eagles should be primed to keep the Patriots’ score on the low side. Nick Foles probably wont have quite the same dynamic game as he did against the Vikings, but the Patriots knowing he can throw the ball further than 30 yards should keep them honest and open up some lanes for the run game. Ultimately, I think the Eagles enact their revenge -- which at this point should be more than just bulletin board material. As long as Doug Pederson continues to be “fearless” in his play-calling, there’s no reason the Eagles don’t walk away with the first Super Bowl win in franchise history. (FINALLY!)  CBS Sports' Will Brinson thinks Philadelphia will beat the Patriots by double digits.   Brinson said the Eagles will pressure Brady so much, making the Patriots take short passes instead of deep throws:  But here’s how I think it plays out: the Eagles utilize a heavy-pressure defense to get Brady off his spot early and minimize the ability of New England to throw down the field. Without Julian Edelman in the game, the Pats can’t eat up quite as much short-yardage stuff, although Danny Amendola is a different animal in the playoffs and although Dion Lewis / James White are nice substitutions, Philly was good against pass-catching backs this year ( 10th by DVOA ).   Jared Dubin of CBS Sports doesn't agree with Brinson.   Dubin said Tom Brady will be too much for the Eagles to handle. According to Dubin, New England performs well under pressure, and Brady doesn't rarely commits turnovers:  I wound up siding with Brady and company this time around largely because his performance in pressure situations has been so much better this season than in previous years. His ability and willingness to use his running backs as outlets in the passing game has led to fewer tight-window throws down the field and more safety-valve type throws to Dion Lewis , Rex Burkhead , and James White . As a result, he’s turned the ball over with rushers in his face far less often than in the previous few seasons. So even if the Eagles’ rush hits home on Sunday, they still need Brady to make mistakes with his throws. Brady rarely makes mistakes.  ESPN's Chris Berman has the Patriots winning, 24-21 .  Philadelphia has been undervalued by oddsmakers and will be an underdog in the Super Bowl as well. I make this game Patriots -4, so the market has kind of caught up to what Philadelphia is -- and that is a more complete team than just Carson Wentz at QB. I used to believe in trends more in the past when players didn’t change teams as much, but it has to be said that the Patriots have won their Super Bowls with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick by three, three, three, four and six points -- and they lost the other two by a combined seven points. I think this will be another close game.  Fiona, The Cincinnati Zoo’s star hippopotamus, joined in on making Super Bowl predictions.  She chose the Eagles to win the big game. Now, you have to like the Eagles' chances of winning.  Eight experts at NJ.com made Super bowl predictions. Six picked Philly.   Shocking, we know. Matt Lombardo, an Eagles reporter for the online publication, said the Eagles have a "better and deeper roster" than the Patriots.  The Patriots have Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, but the Eagles have the better and deeper roster. This game is going to be won along the line of scrimmage, where the Eagles have the better offensive and defensive lines. Whether it’s unblockable All-Pro defensive tackle Fletcher Cox , who is more than capable of providing pressure up the middle against Brady or an offensive line that has an All-Pro center, All-Pro tackle and Pro Bowl guard in Jason Kelce , Lane Johnson , and Brandon Books, the Eagles have the edge. Meanwhile, Doug Pederson has done a masterful job of unlocking the keys to the Eagles ‘offense and Nick Foles’ potential via run-pass options that will put a strain on the Patriots’ defense.   At Boston.com, Chad Finn unsurprisingly sees the Patriots winning .  The more I think about it, the more convinced I become that this will be a win for the Patriots, but not a wild and dramatic win. I would not be shocked if it’s a stylistic replay of the first time the Patriots and Eagles met in the Super Bowl 13 years ago.  No matter who you vote for in this game, let's hope Super Bowl 52 adds on to the long list of great Super Bowl memories.

Jim Davis/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)      Super Bowl LII will be contested between the AFC’s New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFC. It’s an intriguing matchup, pitting the top seeds in each conference against one another, although the similarities end there. This contest will feature the defending champions against an upstart club making its first appearance in the NFL Playoffs since 2013. New England has been a regular fixture in the big game—making it eight times since the 2001 campaign—while Philly hasn’t been this far since 2004, when it came up just short against the Pats in Super Bowl XXXIX. That title cemented a New England dynasty, as it was the organization’s second in a row and third in four years. Interestingly enough, the Patriots are now in position to accomplish that same feat against the exact same opponent.  Oddsmakers are clearly expecting the Patriots to become the first back-to-back champion since they last accomplished it in 2003-2004, opening them as a six-point favorite over the Eagles before the line was bet down to 5.5 almost immediately (Edit 1/29 at 6:30 p.m. ET: the line is now NE -4.5) . Don’t write off Philadelphia yet, as the team has thrived as an underdog throughout the postseason. The Eagles players utilized the betting lines for both the Divisional Round and NFC Championship as motivation, embracing their underdog status by donning dog masks on the field after a win and encouraging fans to wear them to the NFC Championship Game . They’ll now face their toughest challenge yet, needing to best an opponent they’ve only won against once since the turn of the millennium.  Adam Schefter  highlighted some key storylines for the game:   It’s a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX, Eagles vs. Patriots.  It’s LeGarrette Blount and Chris Long vs their former team.  It’s the Patriots’ record 10th Super Bowl appearance vs an Eagles’ team still trying to win its first Super Bowl.  — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter)  January 22, 2018     Will Philadelphia pull off its third straight upset and finally bring a title to the City of Brotherly Love, or will the Pats add yet another Super Bowl ring to their collection by winning a fortnight from now? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com analyzed the opening line and sent along his early take on the action.

Philadelphia Eagles (NBC)  AFC No. 1 Vs. NFC No. 1  NE -5  48      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook  Super Bowl LII Preview: New England Patriots (AFC No. 1) vs. Philadelphia Eagles (NFC No. 1)    The Patriots appeared mortal for much of the 2018 AFC Championship Game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, looking rattled by their foe’s hard-hitting, fast defense. It appeared that the Jags had finally found a way to topple this group, especially after knocking star tight end Rob Gronkowski out of the game with a concussion at the end of the first half.  Gronkowski's injury has an impact on the betting line, according to odds consultant Scott Cooley of BetDSI:   There aren’t any players other than quarterbacks that impact the spread from an oddsmaking standpoint. However, if Rob Gronkowski is not cleared for this game due to a concussion, the betting public will react and we will adjust the odds accordingly. He is certainly a big part of the offense, but we all know they can win without him.   Quarterback Tom Brady was taking a beating and it seemed that Tom Coughlin—Jacksonville’s VP of football operations and the architect of two Super Bowl wins at New England’s expense during his time head coaching the New York Giants—would get the best of this team yet again. The Jags built up a 20-10 lead with only 12 minutes left and started thinking they might be punching a ticket to Minneapolis for the first Super Bowl berth in franchise history.    As he’s found a way to do so many times before, Brady would not let that be and willed his squad to a win. Dealing with a cut on his throwing hand that dominated the headlines leading up to the game, the future Hall of Famer found his groove in the clutch and dissected the secondary precision. He finished the fourth quarter comeback having completed 9-of-14 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns—both to sure-handed wideout Danny Amendola—orchestrating his 12 th game-winning postseason drive and the 54 th of his career to lead the Pats to a 24-20 win . The 40-year-old did this all against the league’s best passing defense, a group that gave up a mere 169.9 yards per game to opposing signal-callers and allowed only 17 passing touchdowns all season.  New England head coach Bill Belichick, the other constant during New England’s unprecedented run to eight AFC titles in 17 seasons, was characteristically dry when discussing Brady’s ability to play through the hand injury on Sunday, as per NESN.com : “I mean, look, Tom did a great job and he’s a tough guy. We all know that alright? But we’re not talking about open-heart surgery.”  Brady himself admitted that the injury actually worried him leading up to the game, as per ESPN :   I thought, 'Of all the plays, my season can't end on a handoff in practice. I didn't come this far to end on a handoff…I’ve never had anything like it. I've had a couple of crazy injuries, but this was pretty crazy. I wasn't sure how I was going to do. Wednesday, Wednesday night, Thursday, I wasn't sure. Friday, gained a little confidence. Saturday, trying to figure out what we could do. Sunday, try to come out here and make it happen.   The good news is that Brady’s stitches should come out by the middle of this week, giving him plenty of time to get fully recovered before Super Bowl LII’s kickoff on February 4. He’ll need to be at 100% to help extend his unprecedented five championships as a starting QB against a tough Eagles opponent that is coming off a much more convincing win in the NFC Championship.  Philadelphia was dominant on Sunday night, obliterating the Minnesota Vikings 38-7 in a game it wasn’t expected to win after betting closed with Minnesota laying three points. Oddsmakers appeared to be onto something after the Eagles gave up a quick score on the opening drive, but the defense locked in and didn’t allow their opponent to put another point on the board after that. This thorough routing ending the Vikings’ dream of becoming the first team to ever play in a Super Bowl in their home stadium. Philly will instead travel to U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis with aspirations to win the first title in franchise history.    The Eagles are now 5.5-point underdogs for their matchup with New England in two weeks and haven’t faced odds this long all season. They outright lost and failed to cover as four-point ‘dogs against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 2, the only game it received more than three points in during the 2017 campaign and subsequent postseason. Much has changed for the Eagles since that defeat in Arrowhead Stadium, none more impactful than the team’s adjustment under center.  Backup quarterback Nick Foles took over for Carson Wentz after the second-year signal-caller tore his ACL late in Week 14 and has improbably guided his franchise back to the Super Bowl. After besting the Vikings, Foles is now 4-1 as a starter. His only loss came in a meaningless Week 17 game against the Dallas Cowboys, in which home field advantage through the playoffs was already secure.  Locking up the No. 1 seed was instrumental for the Eagles—who finished the regular season with an impressive 13-3 record, the same as New England—as the home crowd helped push the team to back-to-back upsets over the Falcons and Vikings, but the improved play of Foles was what truly propelled the team to this Super Bowl appearance. The Arizona product looked more comfortable as the playoffs went on, bettering his play in consecutive games. He started out by managing the Divisional Round game against Atlanta well, completing 76% of his passes for 246 yards, but failed to throw any touchdowns in a 15-10 victory. Foles had no issues finding the end zone on Sunday evening, torching Minnesota’s top-ranked defense for 352 yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers on 26-of-33 passing attempts. If Foles can keep it up, he has a great chance of becoming the 10th backup QB in history and first since Tom Brady in Super Bowl XXXVI to win a ring.  As prolific as their quarterback was on Sunday evening, the Eagles defense made sure a merely average outing would have sufficed. The Vikings mustered 333 yards, but weren’t able to capitalize after being forced into three critical turnovers by an opportunistic defense. Minnesota quarterback Case Keenum had only thrown one interception in his last four starts, but was picked twice and lost a fumble in the NFC Championship. The Vikings running game, which was one of the best during the regular season, was held to 70 yards on 18 carries. The Philadelphia D will need to clamp down one final time and come up with a memorable performance if it is going to stop Brady and co. from marching to a record-tying sixth Super Bowl for the franchise.

I can not wait.  — Peter Burns (@PeterBurnsESPN) January 22, 2018   Early Super Bowl LII Expert Prediction    Price’s Take: This Super Bowl matchup is an interesting one. Most people expected the Pats to be here as they had the best odds to win it all right before the season started at 3-1. The Eagles were 2-1 to even make the postseason—compared to 1-15 for New England—and 35-1 to claim a title. Anyone who bet the Birds at that line is sitting on what could potentially be a very valuable ticket, but they’ll have to get past a team they’ve long struggled with to cash in.  The Eagles have only won against the Patriots in the last 15 years, beating them 35-28 in 2015. They forced Tom Brady into two interceptions and sacked him four times during the contest, while then-starter Sam Bradford came through with two touchdowns, no turnovers and only was sacked once. The keys to winning in 2018 are going be the exact same—hit Brady and avoid mistakes that New England will absolutely capitalize on—but it’s not going to be easy as much of the roster and coaching staff has turned over and the Pats offense has evolved in the years since.  The way to overcome this Pats team is to meet them in the regular season, see how Brady operates and get comfortable facing the many unique looks they throw at you when on the offensive. That’s how the New York Giants topped them in two Super Bowls, as well as how the Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos and New York Jets bested them in their other five postseason losses since the dynasty began in 2001. If you haven’t seen them, you simply aren’t prepared, as New England has never lost a game against an opponent it faces for the first time that season in the playoffs. Film just doesn't seem to cut it against New England.  The Eagles won’t go down without a fight, but they won’t be able to come through in the clutch. Brady thrives in situations where most quarterbacks would be rattled, as evidenced by his double-digit fourth quarter comebacks against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI and even this week against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Even if Philly has a lead late in the game, it’s going to be impossible to keep it if the Pats get the ball back with a chance to win in the clutch. We’ve seen it time and time again and it won’t change this year.  I like the Eagles getting 5.5, however, as New England has only won a single Super Bowl by more than five points (last year's six-point victory in overtime against the Falcons) and the contests always seems to come down to the wire. I just can’t trust Foles to lead this team to victory in crunch time, even after his big performance in the NFC Championship Game. The Patriots battle-tested, veteran-laden roster is built to win this time of year and should come through when it matters most.
