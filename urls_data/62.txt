Home Life Hacks by fourleafclover Follow 116,029 8 27 Posted Jul. 18, 2009 Stats Introduction: How to Find a 4 Leaf Clover in 5 Minutes! I found my first 4 leaf clover on the 17th of July 2009, and it only took me five minutes! This was about the fifth time I'd gone looking with my dad. My dad said the chances of finding one were very, very poor as we were only going to be out for about half an hour. We went to an extended bit of a cemetery where there are only about 8 graves and millions of clovers! This is where I normally go looking because there are so many clovers! Note that if you do find a 4 leaf clover, look around the place where you find it. All of the mutant clovers pictured were all found within 100 square feet! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 1: Peaches!!! If you are going to look with someone else (in my case, my dad) tell them to look in a different place from you. Also, think of a codeword that you will say if you find one. I told my dad to say peaches if he found a 4 leaf clover and that I would do the same if I found a 4 leaf clover. Using codewords is a good way to communicate with the person you are looking with. After five minutes of looking, I found a four leaf clover and yelled out 'peaches!'. But how did I find it in five minutes when sometimes I search up to 2 hours and find nothing? Lets see :-) Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 2: Good Searching Skills Four leaf clovers can crop up anywhere so it's just luck if you find a 4 leaf clover. To find one, you need good searching skills and good eyes. People say that finding a four leaf clover is a luck omen as there is only 1 four leaf clover in 10000 three leafers! Always bring a book with you in case you find one. Don't bother bringing a magnifying glass with you because that achieves nothing. You will spend ages and ages looking in one patch if you look at each and every clover atom! The trick is to just glance down as you look. That way, all though you don't see every clover, gives you more chances of finding one because you see more patches. If you have good searching skills, you will find one much easier. Remember: Looking at every clover through a magnifying glass is a waste of time! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 3: Sets of Three The 3 leaf clover has three leaves (of course) and is a member of the white clover plant 'Trifolium repens'. A good tactic for finding a four leaf clover is to think about the sets. Each 'normal' clover has a set of three leaves. A four leaf clover has, well, a set of four leaves. Just think of the sets. Say each set you see in your mind as you pass the clover. If you are lucky, you will come across something that doesn't look like a set of three. Don't get your hopes up. It is probably just a three leaf clover, but with another three leaf clover underneath it. Wriggle it around. If it is still a 4 leaf clover, pick it. If it is still a 4 leaf clover when you pick it, you found one! Lucky you! If you follow the sets tactic, any mutant will really stick out! Even the smallest four leafer! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 4: 5, 6, 7, 8 Leafers Mutant clovers do not stop at four leaves. Five leaf clovers are possible, as well as six leafers, seven leafers, and maybe even eight leafers! The world record is a 21 leaf clover. Twenty-one leaves seems beyond any mutation. It must be a freak! You also find that the more leaves, the thicker the stalk. I found my first 5 leafer on the 19th of July! If you look on page 127 in the Guinness book of world records 2009, you will see the stalk of an eighteen leaf clover Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 5: Mix and Muddle The number of leaves on a clover isn't the only type of mutant clover there is. There are many, many other mutations that occur with clovers. I heard somewhere about a spade leafed clover. That will be one mutant, but a spade four leafed clover would be two mutations mixed together! A clover holds so many possibilities. And so many mutations that can be mixed! You may have a five leaf clover with one leaf in a mitten shape, two spade leaves, one upside down leaf and one 'rust' coloured leaf. (Not that all that can't happen)! But the chances of finding a clover like that would be almost minus! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 6: AHH! TWO LEAF CLOVER! Not to worry. Probably one leaf fell off. Besides, two leaf clovers don't necessarily bring bad luck. In theory, a two leaf clover could be possible, but it would be very hard to prove it was a two leaf clover. Also you could say a 1 leaf clover exists. But that would be as rare as a five leafer! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 7: I Found a 4 Leaf Clover! After you've done the tactics, you may have found one. If you are lucky, you would have. If you do find one, and you've made sure it's a REAL 4 leaf clover, scream your codeword. When I screamed my codeword, my dad thought I was joking. After you've screamed your codeword, if you want to keep it, pick it and read the next step. If you don't really care, just leave it and don't read the next step. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 8: Preserving the Clover This is probably the hardest bit of four leaf clover finding. When you first pick the clover, put it in the book, memorize the page number that you shut it (I shut it on page 35) and hold it spine upwards so that the clover doesn't fall out. When you get home, get out a big and heavy book (I used harry potter and the order of the phoenix) and put it on top of the book you shut the clover in and put it in the airing cupboard for at least a week. Clear some space in the airing cupboard and tell everyone to be careful. Maybe make a warning sign and stick it on the airing cupboard door. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 9: Frame the Clover In the week when you are preserving the clover, buy a small frame of about two inches by five inches. After the week, carefully take the big book off the little book with the clover and then take the book out spine upwards. Flip to the page with the clover on (35 in my case) and take the clover out. Slip the clover into the little frame then keep it as a good luck charm and show it all to your friends. Now you've read this, why don't you go out there looking for 4 leaf clovers? There's millions out there. Hundreds of millions! In the past two days I've put these skills to the test and found 11 more 4 leaf clovers, and a 'spade' leaf clover.

Ask Question 23  Comments admin 8 years ago Reply Hey, this is a great instructable and is very informative. Just one thing is missing... pictures! It really helps a lot when trying to follow directions so you should consider taking some photographs. Once you do that and leave me a message when you have so that we can publish your work.

Thanks!

Thanks for the cool instructable and we hope to publish this soon! ProfessorPi 23 days ago Reply When I was little in my schoolyard there was a bike rack and all around it was mutated clovers. One girl found a 9-leaf clover there, and I found 3 7-leaf clovers. It was amazing! peteandoreen1 4 months ago Reply This is like photo's of the Tasmanian Tiger, all a blur which only causes doubt. Explain why you can't put clear shots up. Reyanshreedytummala 1 year ago Reply I grow 10 million cloves and I found a four leaf clover in one minute panicmose 1 year ago Reply I can't believe there are instructions for finding a 4-leaf clover!!  I used to find several almost every day in my high school courtyard. Because we found so many, we would just use thick clear packing tape on either side (like a do-it-yourself lamination). I still have a few after a decade (or so...) It still gets to me every time I hear the whole "4-leaf clover urban legend" saying!! Ashleigh12345678987654321 1 year ago Reply Im just saying, whut do u need the book 4? Great steps though NoahS10 1 year ago Reply If you're thinking long-term preservation, I think flattening a clover in a book is a good way to dry it out and prevent it from withering.  Once it's dry you should be able to keep it in a plastic sleeve or frame, as suggested in the article. jdp420 3 years ago Reply I found this 5 leaf clover in my garden today. GalaxyW1 1 year ago Reply LUCKY akaamazing 3 years ago Reply I'm all the time finding four & five leave covers! I've did this all my life! I don't find as many five leaf ones as I do four leaves! I find four or five five leaf clovers a year! I find hundreds of four leaf cloves a year! The most leaves I have ever found was when I was about ten yrs. old & it had eleven leaves on it!  I tried to preserve it but in 1975 we didn't have a lot of the things we have now much less the world wide web to tell me how to preserve it! So I guess you will have to take my word on it! My Mother did see it but she didn't care to much for my clover hunting. I would leave them in my pocket & they would come out in the dryer & make a mess! To bad I didn't get to save all the ones I have found in my life because that would have broken the world record of 160,000! Last week I was just walking in the yard & bent over & picked a seven leaf clover! I find a lot by walking & just glancing down!

Four-leaf clover   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   "Lucky clover" and "lucky leaf" redirect here. The term is also often used for the wood-sorrel  ( Oxalis acetosella ) and Oxalis tetraphylla , a common potted plant.  For the popular 20th-century song, see " I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover ". For the 2010 Diana Vickers song, see Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree .     Four-leaf white clover ( Trifolium repens )    The four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover . According to tradition, such clovers bring good luck , [1] though it is not clear when or how that tradition got started. The earliest mention of “Fower-leafed or purple grasse” is from 1640 and simply says that it was kept in gardens because it was “good for the purples in children or others” [2] . A description from 1869 says that four-leaf clovers were “gathered at night-time during the full moon by sorceresses, who mixed it with Vervain and other ingredients, while young girls in search of a token of perfect happiness made quest of the plant by day” [3] . The first reference to luck might be from an 11-year-old girl, who wrote in an 1877 letter to St. Nicholas Magazine , “Did the fairies ever whisper in your ear, that a four-leaf clover brought good luck to the finder?” [4]     Contents    1  Occurrence  2  Cause  3  Multi-leaved cultivars  4  Other species  5  Symbolic usage  6  Meanings  7  References  8  External links     Occurrence [ edit ]  It is claimed that there are approximately 10,000 three-leaf clovers for every four-leaf clover. [5] However, an actual survey of over 5 million clovers found the real frequency to be closer to 1 in 5000. [6]  Even so, this probability has not deterred collectors who have reached records as high as 160,000 four-leaf clovers in a lifetime. However, the world record for four-leaf clovers in a single day is 72, and the record for one hour is 51, set by an American named Griffin McDowell on August 12, 2013. [7]  Clovers can have more than four leaves. Five-leaf clovers are less commonly found naturally than four-leaf clovers; [8] [9] however, they, too, have been successfully cultivated. [10] Some four-leaf clover collectors, particularly in Ireland, regard the five-leaf clover, known as a rose clover, as a particular prize. [11] In exceptionally rare cases, clovers are able to grow with six leaves and more in nature. [12] The most leaves ever found on a single clover stem ( Trifolium repens L .) is 56 and was discovered by Shigeo Obara of Hanamaki City, Iwate, Japan, on 10 May 2009. [13] [14]  Cause [ edit ]     A four-leaf clover    It is debated whether the fourth leaf is caused genetically or environmentally. Its relative rarity (1 in 5000 clovers [6] ) suggests a possible recessive gene appearing at a low frequency. Alternatively, four-leaf clovers could be caused by somatic mutation or a developmental error of environmental causes. They could also be caused by the interaction of several genes that happen to segregate in the individual plant. It is possible all four explanations could apply to individual cases. This means that multiple four-leaf clovers could be found in the same clover plant. [15]  Researchers from the University of Georgia have reported finding the gene that turns ordinary three-leaf clovers into the coveted four-leaf types. Masked by the three-leaf gene and strongly influenced by environmental condition, molecular markers now make it possible to detect the presence of the gene for four-leaves and for breeders to work with it. The results of the study, which also located two other leaf traits in the white-clover genome, were reported in the July/August 2010 edition of Crop Science , published by the Crop Science Society of America. [16]  The other leaf traits, the red fleck mark and red midrib, a herringbone pattern that runs down the center of each leaflet in a bold red color, were mapped to nearby locations, resolving a century-old question as to whether these leaf traits were controlled by one gene or two separate genes.  White clover has many genes that affect leaf color and shape, and the three in the study were very rare. These traits can be quite attractive, particularly if combined with others, and can turn clover into an ornamental plant for use in flower beds [17]  There are reports of farms in the US which specialize in four-leaf clovers, producing as many as 10,000 a day (to be sealed in plastic as "lucky charms") by introducing a genetically engineered ingredient to the plants to encourage the aberration (there are, however, widely available cultivars that regularly produce leaves with multiple leaflets – see below). [18] These are associated to Saint Patricks Day.  Multi-leaved cultivars [ edit ]     Example of a five-leaf clover    There are some cultivars of white clover ( Trifolium repens ) which regularly produce more than three leaflets, including purple-leaved T. repens "Purpurascens Quadrifolium" and green-leaved T. repens "Quadrifolium". [19]  Trifolium repens "Good Luck" is a cultivar which has three, four, or five green, dark-centered leaflets per leaf. [20]  Other species [ edit ]  Other plants may be mistaken for, or misleadingly sold as, "four-leaf clovers"; for example, Oxalis tetraphylla is a species of wood sorrel with leaves resembling a four-leaf clover. [21] [22] Other species that have been sold as "four-leaf clovers" include Marsilea quadrifolia . [23] [24]  Symbolic usage [ edit ]          The Centre parties in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Åland, Estonia, Poland and Lithuania have similar backgrounds and identities, as indicated by their similar logos, based on the four-leaf clover          This section is in a list format that may be better presented using prose .  You can help by converting this section to prose, if appropriate . Editing help is available.  (March 2016)      Italian automobile maker Alfa Romeo used to paint a four-leaf clover, or quadrifoglio, on the side of their racing cars. This tradition started in the 1923 Targa Florio race, when driver Ugo Sivocci decorated his car with a green clover on a white background.  Los Angeles-based space exploration company SpaceX includes a four-leaf clover on each space mission embroidered patch as a good luck charm. Inclusion of the clover has become a regular icon on SpaceX's flight patches ever since the company's first successful Falcon 1 rocket launch in 2008, which was the first mission to feature a clover "for luck" on its patch. [25]  Celtic Football Club , an association football team from Glasgow, Scotland , have used the four leaf clover as the club's official badge for over 40 years.  Former Japanese game developer studio Clover Studio used a four-leaf clover as their logo.  Several businesses and organisations use a four-leaf clover in their logos to signify Celtic origins. [26] [27] [28]  The global network of youth organizations 4-H uses a green four-leaf clover with a white H on each leaf. [29]  The logo of the New Jersey Lottery features an outline of the state in white on a green four-leaf clover printed on a lottery draw machine ball.   Meanings [ edit ]  Some folk traditions assign a different attribute to each leaf of a clover. The first leaf represents hope, the second stands for faith, the third is for love and the fourth leaf brings luck to the finder. A fifth leaf represents money, but there is no meaning as yet for the sixth leaf and above. [12] Some reports claim six to be fame and seven to be longevity, though the notions' origination is unknown.  References [ edit ]    ^  Harry Oliver (2010).

Posted 1:38 pm, March 15, 2014, by Bailey Woolum KFOR-TV    Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn Reddit Email       This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.           ×  What’s so lucky about a four-leaf clover?        What’s so lucky about a four-leaf clover?  “Well, you’re lucky to find one in the first place,” said Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation President Stephen Prescott, M.D. “The symbolism of the four-leaf clover may be everywhere, but a real one is actually a rarity.”  About 1 specimen in 10,000 of Trifolium repens (aka white clover) has four leaves instead of the usual three.  Trifolium is Latin for “three leaf.”  “Saint Patrick was said to use the shamrock, the three-leaf clover, to teach about the Holy Trinity,” Prescott said. “Whereas the four-leaf version is supposed to stand for faith, hope, love and luck.”  It’s said that only by finding one accidentally is a four-leaf clover lucky, he said, but the reason for the extra leaf is pure science.  “The cause of the fourth leaf is likely genetic. Because it’s so rare, it might be a recessive gene—the way red hair appears only occasionally in some families—or some type of mutation,” Prescott said. “And that’s something OMRF scientists have plenty of experience studying.”  Inside each cell in the human body there’s a copy of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) made up of billions of base pairs of proteins.  “About 99.5 percent of human DNA is identical, but the differences in that .5 percent are what make us individuals,” Prescott said. “Changes in the DNA are called mutations and we all have them. Some make no difference at all, while others are linked to everything from hair color and height to different diseases.”  Researchers at OMRF use patient samples to find genetic mutations related to autoimmune diseases, including lupus, Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as cancer and developmental disorders.  “By understanding how our genes can cause diseases, we hope to find new ways to predict and prevent the onset of illnesses or find new treatments for diseases we already have,” he said.  In 2010, scientists at the University of Georgia found and manipulated a gene that produces a fourth leaf on Trifolium repens .  “But, much like our work, I suspect it was more than luck that led them to that discovery,” Prescott said.

Keep the Luck o' the Irish With You Year Round: How to Preserve a Four Leaf Clover!  Arts & Culture , Family & Parenting , Seasonal & Current Events   By Chelsea Triola Published: March 13 2014    LongIsland.com           If you're lucky enough to find a four leaf clover, be sure to preserve it by following the steps below!   Print   Email       March is a month full of fun St. Patrick’s Day activities that both adults and children can enjoy together. There are tons of events and parades all across the island that are perfect for a weekend out with the family. If you’re looking to stay close to home but still have an eventful day, we have put together a list of steps on how to preserve four leaf clovers!  Four leaf clovers are especially lucky and people feel the luck when they find them. That’s if they find them! This is why a lot of people like to preserve their clovers so they can keep the luck forever. You can preserve them and put them in a frame to put up as décor in your home. If you're interested in a more kid-friendly craft, preseve your four leaf clover into a laminated bookmark. Choose from the two fun crafts or do both by following the instructions below:   Preserving Four Leaf Clovers in A Picture Frame   1. First, you must find a four leaf clover. If you’re lucky enough to find one, you will probably find another. Most of the time the four leaf clovers are found together, or nearby from one another.   2. Press the clovers. After you find your lucky clovers, it is important to press them as soon as possible. Without pressing them, the clovers can wilt and fold which won’t look as nice. There are a couple of different ways you can press your clovers:    Press in between sheets of paper.   Press in the pages of a book you no longer care about or underneath a large textbook.   Weigh them down with heavy books.    3. Once pressed, handle with care and place on paper. Paint your clover with a few drops of green food coloring which will enhance the color. This step is optional but encouraged so your clover won’t lose its bright color in a few weeks.   4. Allow the clover to dry overnight. Once dried, repeat the step above with fresh paper.   5. Find the perfect picture frame. Once you have your frame, clean both sides of the glass and place it on a clean rag and allow it to air dry over night. Make sure the glass is cleaned properly, once the clover is inside you will not be able to clean it again.   6. Choose an acid-free paper to mount the clover.   7. Lay the frame face-down on the paper, without the glass, and trace the inside of the frame.  8. Cut the paper along the traced line. This will ensure that the paper fills the frame but does not cover all of the glass. If you’re using a mat instead of paper, trim the mat instead using the same process.   9. Place a small amount of acid-free glue in the middle of the clover and press it down gently onto the paper.  10. Spray the entire paper with an acid-free, UV-resistant sealant.  11. Lay the paper onto the mat and tape in place with acid-free tape. If you’re not using a mat, you can skip this step.  12. Cut a piece of Mylar the same size as the paper or mat.  13. Center the mounted clover face-down onto the glass so that an even rim of glass appears around the paper or mat.  14. Place the plastic Mylar on top.  15. Seal the mounted clover to the frame with aluminum tape. Be sure that the tape adheres to the glass along with the paper. Make sure not to misalign the tape so it is not visible on the front of the glass.  16. Assemble the frame. Then put your lucky clover on display and enjoy!   Preserving Four Leaf Clover into A Laminated Bookmark   1. Follow steps 1-4 above for this craft as well!  Overview: Find your four leaf clover and press it inbetween paper or the pages of a book to flatten it out. Be sure to add the food coloring to the clover so the brightness lasts longer. Let dry overnight and repeat food coloring step with fresh paper.   2. Create your bookmark. Have the kids cut out their own rectangular shaped bookmark. They can decorate it if they'd like or leave blank so the clover can stand out. It's best to use a thick paper so your bookmark is not flimsy.   3. Use a gluestick to glue your four leaf clover to the bookmark. This will ensure that it stays put. If you place laminate over them without glue, the clovers will lift up off the paper.   4. Place laminate over the bookmark. Do this carefully then trim off any of the excess laminate. Voila! Your bookmark is ready to use!  There are a few other interesting ways to preserve a clover along with different places to put them. Some make pieces of jewelry out of them, allowing their luck to stay with them wherever they go, and some put them in the family photo album. You can get creative and preserve them in cool places such as a bottle cap and place them as decoration in your home.  Make it a fun and educational time with the family by allowing the kids to help out while telling them a bit about the process. Discuss St. Patrick’s Day together and see who can come up with other fun activities to do all month long!

Home Life Hacks by fourleafclover Follow 116,029 8 27 Posted Jul. 18, 2009 Stats Introduction: How to Find a 4 Leaf Clover in 5 Minutes! I found my first 4 leaf clover on the 17th of July 2009, and it only took me five minutes! This was about the fifth time I'd gone looking with my dad. My dad said the chances of finding one were very, very poor as we were only going to be out for about half an hour. We went to an extended bit of a cemetery where there are only about 8 graves and millions of clovers! This is where I normally go looking because there are so many clovers! Note that if you do find a 4 leaf clover, look around the place where you find it. All of the mutant clovers pictured were all found within 100 square feet! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 1: Peaches!!! If you are going to look with someone else (in my case, my dad) tell them to look in a different place from you. Also, think of a codeword that you will say if you find one. I told my dad to say peaches if he found a 4 leaf clover and that I would do the same if I found a 4 leaf clover. Using codewords is a good way to communicate with the person you are looking with. After five minutes of looking, I found a four leaf clover and yelled out 'peaches!'. But how did I find it in five minutes when sometimes I search up to 2 hours and find nothing? Lets see :-) Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 2: Good Searching Skills Four leaf clovers can crop up anywhere so it's just luck if you find a 4 leaf clover. To find one, you need good searching skills and good eyes. People say that finding a four leaf clover is a luck omen as there is only 1 four leaf clover in 10000 three leafers! Always bring a book with you in case you find one. Don't bother bringing a magnifying glass with you because that achieves nothing. You will spend ages and ages looking in one patch if you look at each and every clover atom! The trick is to just glance down as you look. That way, all though you don't see every clover, gives you more chances of finding one because you see more patches. If you have good searching skills, you will find one much easier. Remember: Looking at every clover through a magnifying glass is a waste of time! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 3: Sets of Three The 3 leaf clover has three leaves (of course) and is a member of the white clover plant 'Trifolium repens'. A good tactic for finding a four leaf clover is to think about the sets. Each 'normal' clover has a set of three leaves. A four leaf clover has, well, a set of four leaves. Just think of the sets. Say each set you see in your mind as you pass the clover. If you are lucky, you will come across something that doesn't look like a set of three. Don't get your hopes up. It is probably just a three leaf clover, but with another three leaf clover underneath it. Wriggle it around. If it is still a 4 leaf clover, pick it. If it is still a 4 leaf clover when you pick it, you found one! Lucky you! If you follow the sets tactic, any mutant will really stick out! Even the smallest four leafer!

Five leaf clovers are possible, as well as six leafers, seven leafers, and maybe even eight leafers! The world record is a 21 leaf clover. Twenty-one leaves seems beyond any mutation. It must be a freak! You also find that the more leaves, the thicker the stalk. I found my first 5 leafer on the 19th of July! If you look on page 127 in the Guinness book of world records 2009, you will see the stalk of an eighteen leaf clover Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 5: Mix and Muddle The number of leaves on a clover isn't the only type of mutant clover there is. There are many, many other mutations that occur with clovers. I heard somewhere about a spade leafed clover. That will be one mutant, but a spade four leafed clover would be two mutations mixed together! A clover holds so many possibilities. And so many mutations that can be mixed! You may have a five leaf clover with one leaf in a mitten shape, two spade leaves, one upside down leaf and one 'rust' coloured leaf. (Not that all that can't happen)! But the chances of finding a clover like that would be almost minus! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 6: AHH! TWO LEAF CLOVER! Not to worry. Probably one leaf fell off. Besides, two leaf clovers don't necessarily bring bad luck. In theory, a two leaf clover could be possible, but it would be very hard to prove it was a two leaf clover. Also you could say a 1 leaf clover exists. But that would be as rare as a five leafer! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 7: I Found a 4 Leaf Clover! After you've done the tactics, you may have found one. If you are lucky, you would have. If you do find one, and you've made sure it's a REAL 4 leaf clover, scream your codeword. When I screamed my codeword, my dad thought I was joking. After you've screamed your codeword, if you want to keep it, pick it and read the next step. If you don't really care, just leave it and don't read the next step. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 8: Preserving the Clover This is probably the hardest bit of four leaf clover finding. When you first pick the clover, put it in the book, memorize the page number that you shut it (I shut it on page 35) and hold it spine upwards so that the clover doesn't fall out. When you get home, get out a big and heavy book (I used harry potter and the order of the phoenix) and put it on top of the book you shut the clover in and put it in the airing cupboard for at least a week. Clear some space in the airing cupboard and tell everyone to be careful. Maybe make a warning sign and stick it on the airing cupboard door. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 9: Frame the Clover In the week when you are preserving the clover, buy a small frame of about two inches by five inches. After the week, carefully take the big book off the little book with the clover and then take the book out spine upwards. Flip to the page with the clover on (35 in my case) and take the clover out. Slip the clover into the little frame then keep it as a good luck charm and show it all to your friends. Now you've read this, why don't you go out there looking for 4 leaf clovers? There's millions out there. Hundreds of millions! In the past two days I've put these skills to the test and found 11 more 4 leaf clovers, and a 'spade' leaf clover.

Once it's dry you should be able to keep it in a plastic sleeve or frame, as suggested in the article. jdp420 3 years ago Reply I found this 5 leaf clover in my garden today.

I tried to preserve it but in 1975 we didn't have a lot of the things we have now much less the world wide web to tell me how to preserve it! So I guess you will have to take my word on it! My Mother did see it but she didn't care to much for my clover hunting. I would leave them in my pocket & they would come out in the dryer & make a mess! To bad I didn't get to save all the ones I have found in my life because that would have broken the world record of 160,000!

We asked the experts to find out.                              By Laura Richards             Pinterest         Facebook         Twitter                         Google+             Pinterest         Facebook         Twitter                         Google+                  Photography by: Aaron Dyer    How would you feel if you were walking in your yard and found a four-leaf clover? Lucky, right?    Well, the actual chances of finding one is 1 in 10,000. Dr. John Frett , Professor of Landscape Horticulture and Director of the University of Delaware Botanic Gardens, says, "It is not that unusual. The 1 in 10,000 chance is for a 'typical' group of plants, a group that represents the statistical norm for the population. Individual plants vary in their propensity to produce the fourth leaflet, just like people vary in height. Breeders have selected varieties that produce as much as 50 percent of the leaves with four leaflets. Combined with the fact that clover spreads by underground stems, a large patch of clover can grow with an increased ability to produce greater than normal leaves with four leaflets leading to an increased rate of discovering the elusive four-leaf clover."    Four-leaf clovers represent faith, love, and luck. According to Clovers Online , authentic four-leaf clovers come from the White Clover plant. Many people believe that a shamrock is a four-leaf clover, but they are not the same. Irish tradition holds that the shamrock or three-leaf clover represents the Holy Trinity: one for the Father, one for the Son, and one for the Holy Spirit. Another way of identifying a real four-leaf clover is that the fourth leaflet is usually smaller than the other three leaflets.     [DIY: Say "Happy St. Patrick's Day" With Four-Leaf Clover Cards]     Suzi Mekhitarian who lives in a suburb of Sydney, Australia found 21 four-leaf clovers in her front yard back in 2014. The Australian Botanic Garden Director of Science Brett Summerell said that Mekhitarian's patch of clover is unusual. "Instead of the dominant gene characteristics of the plant being three leaves, it is four, increasing the chances of this occurring in a single patch,'' he said. "There hasn't been a great deal of research into this so nobody knows why this occurs but I hear about it happening every five or six years." No matter what the facts, finding a four-leaf clover is still a sign of luck and worth keeping.

March 17, 2016 | Elizabeth Knowles                  Photo credit: pixabay.com     And how can you improve them?  It’s Saint Patrick’s Day and, as Irish legend would have it, finding a four-leaf clover would make you extra lucky. In the original story, Saint Patrick gave a four-leaf clover to a group of his followers and told them that the fourth leaf was put there by God to bring luck — the first three leaves represented hope, faith, and love.  So if you’re down on your luck and are looking for a four-leaf clover, you might be wondering what your chances of actually finding one are. The short answer is: 1 in 10,000. The long answer involves knowing that the gene for a fourth leaf is inheritable, which means that if you find one four-leaf clover , you are more likely to find a second one in the same area. Furthermore, just having the gene isn’t enough, a clover has to sprout in the right conditions — temperature, pollution, soil pH — to grow a fourth leaf, which further suggests that they are likely to grow in similar areas.  SEE ALSO: The Science Behind Our Stubborn Superstitions  If we go back to the simple assumption that the likelihood that any particular clover has four leaves in 1 in 10,000, how big an area would you have to search to be statistically likely to find one? About 12.9 square feet or 1.2 square meters, according to the Scientific American video below.  In the video, editor Eric R. Olson explains that it would take far too long to examine every single clover and that you are actually best to glance them over and let any peculiarities pop out. You should also remember that there are multiple layers of clovers. Technical writer Jim Frost recommends brushing the area you are looking at with your foot to reveal the plants hidden underneath.  Did you know that the four leaves aren’t actually leaves at all? They are leaflets that together all make a single leaf. Thus, whether your clover has three, four or even 56 (the world record) leaflets, it is really a one-leaf clover.  Good luck!

According to Irish tradition, those who find a four-leaf clover are destined for good luck, as each leaf in the clover symbolizes good omens for faith, hope, love, and luck for the finder.  A lesser-known fact about four-leaf clovers is that they aren’t the luckiest symbol after all. Irish legend indicates that those who find a five -leaf clover will actually have more luck and financial success than those who just find a four-leaf clover.  However, good luck can be hard to come by if you’re only relying on finding a four-leaf clover, let alone a five-leaf clover! The estimated statistical odds of finding a four-leaf clover on your first try is 10,000 to 1, and the odds skyrocket to 1,000,000 to 1 if you’re looking to find a five-leaf clover on your first try. (The majority of the clovers you see outside have only three leaves.)  Suppose you want to delve deeper into descriptive statistics and compare the odds of finding a four-leaf clover to the odds of finding a five-leaf clover. In what is known as an odds ratio, you can compare the odds of two events, where the odds of an event equals the probability-the-event-occurs divided by the probability-it-does-not-occur.  In this case, you would find that your odds ratio is 100, showing that it is much more likely for you to find a four-leaf than a five-leaf clover. You can conclude that the odds of finding a four-leaf clover are 100 times greater than your odds of finding a five-leaf clover. (But keep in mind the odds here: it’s still pretty difficult to find a four-leaf clover, especially over a three-leaf clover!)  Why Are Odds Ratios Important?  Odds ratios are not just important for comparing the odds of two events (like we did above with the clovers)—they also play an important role in logistic regression. With binary logistic regression ( Stat > Regression > Binary Logistic Regression in Minitab Statistical Software ), you can investigate the relationship between a binary response and one or more predictors. You can then use the odds ratio for the predictors to quantify how each predictor affects the probabilities of each response.  For example, suppose you are analyzing data from people who have found four-leaf clovers to determine whether the finder’s gender and age affect their finding abilities. You could create a logistic regression model with the following variables:      Variable   Type   Description    Find  Binary response  Equals 0 if the person did not find, and 1 if the person did find    Gender  Binary response  Equals 0 if the person is male, and 1 if the person is female    Age  Continuous predictor  Equals the person’s age     Suppose the logistic regression procedure declares both predictors to be significant. If gender has an odds ratio of 2.0, you conclude that the odds of a woman finding a four-leaf clover is twice the odds of a man finding a four-leaf clover. If age has an odds ratio of 1.05, you conclude that, for each additional year of the finder’s age, the odds of finding increase by 5%.  For each predictor variable in the logistic regression model, Minitab displays an odds ratio and a confidence interval for the odds ratio.  Of course, this is only a hypothetical example!  I’m not sure your age or gender really matters—I think finding a four-leaf clover is all about LUCK.  And that's pretty difficult to quantify!

Then the days before yesterday I found 2 four leaf clovers, and the again just yesterday I once again found 7 four leaf clovers and one five leaf clover!! I beg to differ I know that some people go their whole lives and never find not even one, which used to be the case when i was younger until I reached my early 30's. Now I just seem to be able to find them most of the time. In the past I have also found quite a few 6 leaf clovers and several 7 leaf clovers. I have even found 2 leaf clovers. I think once or twice I have even found clovers with 8 and 9 leafs I don't know if I just naturally find the clovers or if they find me?   Name: Carly Barry • Monday, March 26, 2012  Wow! I'm impressed Rita! Congratulations on your many lucky clover finds. Like I say above-- I think finding lucky clovers is really all about luck (and that's pretty hard to quantify!). Can you share any secrets to your success? I'd love to increase my odds of finding one :)   Name: Maggie • Friday, April 20, 2012  I don't know about odds ratios, but I can find 4 leafs easier than most people. Some days I find a dozen or more without even really trying as they catch my eye while I am walking past. I believe it is a function of field discrimination, as I can easily see them in patches when others cannot unless I point them out.   Name: Nancy Kimes • Wednesday, May 2, 2012  The first four leaf clover I ever found was in Peru in 1999, then I found 2 in Mount Shasta, CA. I am back in Peru and today I found 7 four leaf clovers and 1, 5 leaf clover. What are the odds of that? Peru has always been a magical place... a spiritual jouney for me. But truly, what are the odds?   Name: Rachael • Thursday, May 3, 2012  I just found 5 four-leaf clovers and 1 five-leaf clover within 3minutes.  That happened when I got out of my car right after work, which before I left to go to this morning I found a four leaf clover.  That is 6 four leaf ans 1 five leaf clovers in one day.  I think my lawn has mutated clovers.   Name: Carly Barry • Friday, May 4, 2012  Hi Nancy! It's challenging to figure out the odds of finding 7 4 leaf clovers and 1 5 leaf clover because those events are likely dependent, and without any sense of how those events are dependent, it's hard to calculate the probability. (For example, did you find all the clovers (both four and five-leaf) in close proximity or in the same general area? If so, this makes your events dependent.)  However, if the above events in Peru happened independent of each other, you can just multiply the odds of each event (odds of finding 7 four-leafs multiplied by the odds of finding 1 five leaf) to obtain your answer. (For independent events, the probability that all events will occur is the product of their individual probabilities).  I think you'll find that the probability of you finding 7 four-leaf clovers and 1 five-leaf clover on your first try will be very, very low! Thanks for reading my blog!   Name: Tom • Sunday, May 6, 2012  Yesterday between my girls, my wife, and I we found 33 four leafs and 2 five leafs. I was telling our neighbor about this and she had never seen one. I went back, looked for less than a minute and brought one back to her. She was definitely impressed.   Name: Carly Barry • Saturday, May 12, 2012  Hi Tom, I'm impressed too! Thanks for reading and commenting! -Carly   Name: Darlene • Wednesday, May 16, 2012  My son is now 24... He has always been able to find 4 leaf clovers very easily. On the day he was leaving for a tour of duty in Iraq he found 26! (He came home safe!)  I myself found 2 this Saturday, and 1 Monday, without looking for them!   We were given the news today that my husbands bone scan was clear... His cancer has not spread to his bones!  I don''t know what the odds are, but they have always seemed to be connected to good luck for our family!!   Name: Carly Barry • Wednesday, May 16, 2012  Darlene - I'm happy to hear your son has returned home safely and your husband's prognosis includes good news! It seems that you and your son have really beaten the odds in finding so many four-leaf clovers! I hope good luck continues to come your way. Thank you for reading!   Name: Janet • Friday, May 25, 2012  I have found over 15 four leaf clovers without trying to find them within the last month and today I found 2 five leaf clovers.   Name: Patricia • Wednesday, May 30, 2012  In the past 30 years I have found around about 2000.00 I find one just about every time I go by a clover patch.   Name: Carly Barry • Wednesday, May 30, 2012  Interesting! I'm surprised to hear of so many of you finding high amounts of not only four-leaf clovers, but five-leaf clovers! Are you finding the lucky clovers in the same areas over and over again?  It's also interesting to see it demonstrated that five-leafs are generally harder to find than four-leafs.   Name: Doug • Saturday, June 2, 2012  Your article says that the odds of finding a 4 leaf clover are 1 in 10,000 and the odds of finding a 5 leaf clover are 1 in 1,000,000. On Wednesday the 30th of May, believe it or not, I had the good fortune of finding 7, 4 leaf clovers & 1, 5 leaf clover without any effort of looking for them.   Name: sandra • Thursday, June 7, 2012  I have a patch of 4 leaf clovers in my front yard. I have found a few in my back yard.  Today, I found 2 five leaf clovers in the patch in the front yard.  Maybe I will win the lottery????   Name: Clyde • Saturday, June 16, 2012  The picture of those clovers are wrong. Genuine 4-leaf, 5-leaf, etc. clovers come from the white clover plant. Those pictured are the "imposter" ones.   Name: Carly Barry • Monday, June 18, 2012  Hi Clyde - Thanks for pointing this out! I wasn't aware that most 4 and 5 leaf clovers came from the white clover plant.   Name: Tony Wargo • Wednesday, June 20, 2012  Hi Carly, I made this video last week and wanted to know your perspective on it. In it, I walk right up to a 4-Leaf clover as my first find and then immediately find a 6-Leaf clover. I proceed to find many 5 and 4 leaf clovers.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PPNVtrqaLQ  I have always had an unexplanable ability to tap into a source of energy that I use to find clovers.  I actually wrote a book that was recently published called, "Lucky Life Lessons: A Guide to Cultivating Luck and Positive Energy into Your Life"  I also sell 4-Leaf clovers at: www.artofwargo.com  I'm just curious to hear a statistical analysis about my "ability"  Tony Wargo   Name: Carly • Thursday, June 21, 2012  Hi Tony - Cool video! I'm not sure I've ever heard of anyone finding as many 4, 5, and even 6-leaf clovers in one outing before! Do you frequently find so many lucky clovers at one time? I'm also curious to whether or not you find the clovers in different locations (different cities miles apart or in the same general location each time?)  Statistically, you seem to be beating the odds over and over again! Since you've found so many lucky clovers, have you noticed an increase in personal luck and good fortune?   Name: Marlene Hughes • Friday, July 6, 2012  I have been collecting four, five, six leaf clovers for three years now. The other day I found three-7 leaf clovers in one patch!!! I was so excited.  Finding clovers in my own yard is so therapuetic for me, I am sad when the snow falls and I have to wait until breakup to start looking again:-)   Name: Carly • Friday, July 6, 2012  Hi Marlene - thanks for your comment! Wow, finding three 7-leaf clovers in one patch must be extra lucky! I'm sure the odds of such an event are really low!   Name: Lesley • Monday, July 9, 2012  I found one four leaf clover today and so excited   Name: charie L • Tuesday, July 10, 2012  Hi. maybe nothing out of the ordenary but i've got a 3 leaf, 4 leaf & 5 leaf & their stems all come from the SAME stalk & were joined to the same root.   Name: marylee • Tuesday, July 24, 2012  I just googled  'finding a four leaf clover', and found this article.  I have found many four leaf clovers in my yard.  I don't go looking for them because every time I do, I never find any.  I find them as I'm walking down my walkway to my car or from my car.  I feel compelled to look down and see a four leaf clover.  I am a visual person, so maybe that has something to do with it. I see alot of people seem to find more than one in the same spot.  I still believe that it brings luck, as up to now, I have had very good luck and I'm  57 years old. ( I'd like to believe this.)  heee   Name: Lynn Downey • Thursday, August 2, 2012  I find four-leaf clovers everywhere, and have found many other 5, 6, and 7 -leaf clovers. My youngest child finds them also, he is 11 year old now. They do come up same place every year if you have them in your yard. I just look down and there they are, I live in Iowa, I've found them in fields, yards, parks, out hot air ballooning. I do consider myself a very lucky person. I've always said if I was at concert of 100,000 people and they threw a frisbe, it would hit me! How do others save their clovers? I put them on paper and tape them down with scotch tape and write date and where found. But older ones seem to not stay after awhile. Lynn   Name: Deborah • Saturday, August 4, 2012  I am so excited I found 5-5 Leaf clovers and 5-4 leaf clovers in a patch in my back yard !!! I am going to look for more tomorrow in the area I found the others as darkness was falling an I wasent able to thoughly look through the patch.   Name: Carly Barry • Monday, August 6, 2012  @ Lynn- I've found a good way to save clovers is to dry them like you would flowers, and then store them between the pages of a book.   Name: Bonnie Anne Jewell • Saturday, August 11, 2012  On Friday, July 27 2012 my 16 month old granddaughter, Trinity pulled up a bunch of clovers and to my surprise there were three, four leaf clovers.  We were at a children's park, in Portsmouth,NH.  Then we went back on Thursday, August 9, 2012, to the same area and I found four more, four leaf clovers. I have them pressed in wax paper with date and place found. I've never had luck with taping any plant type materials, but wax paper works great.  Just use two pieces of paper, put the clover, flower,leaf or any plant between them, then place a heavy object over the entire object.   Let it sit there,  for as long as it takes for that plant to completely dry out.  Now, your ART work can be put into a beautiful picture frame for everyone to see how LUCKY we all are!   Name: Doug Van Reeth • Wednesday, August 15, 2012  My wife and I walk our dog every morning to the end of our cul-de-sac here in Portland Maine. Over the summer I've casually collected about 16 four-leaf clovers in this huge patch. This morning I reached down to pluck a four-leafer, and there beside it was a five-leafer! And then another, and then...a THIRD five-leafer. In a patch of clover 12 inches square we found 3 four-leafers and 3 five-leafers! The Mutant Patch! What are those odds?! Doug Van Reeth   Name: Carly Barry • Monday, August 20, 2012  Hi Doug! It's challenging to figure out those exact odds because each event you list is dependent (found in the same general area, same time of day, etc.).  However, if you read the comments above, you'll see that many people find multiple lucky clovers in the same patch over time. So maybe there is something to this -  the odds might be a bit  better for finding multiple over time in the same proximity over multiple tries, but I can't really say for sure. (Also, keep in mind the odds that I list in the blog post are for finding a 4 or 5 leaf clover on your "first try.")  Thanks for reading!   Name: pam gray • Friday, September 7, 2012  I have always found clovers easily. I have 4s 5s and a few 6s. On my wedding anniversary a few weeks ago I found 28 within 20 min. 5 of those were 5 leaf. I have found them in Pa. and Ca. where my son lives. I also believe its thereputic. I give many away, it makes people happy!   Name: Terri • Saturday, September 8, 2012  Over the last 2 years, I have found many 4 leaf clovers. I walk my dog every day, and now I can't pass a patch of clover without looking down. It seems interesting to me that if I bend down to look, I can't find them very easily, but just walking along and looking casually, they "jump out at me"! The first time I found a 5-leafer I was ecstatic.  When I found a single branch with 3, 4 and 5 leaf clovers on it, I brought it home and put it in a glass. It grew for quite a while, and actually produced NEW 4 leafs on it. Yesterday I found my first SIX leaf clover - I'm amazed at how many other people are finding them too! (By the way, the last 2 years do seem to have been very lucky for me...)   Name: Diane • Wednesday, October 17, 2012  In the first few minutes of a trip to a beautiful island I found one without looking for it.  It just happened to be growing in the rubble of an old smelter beside a piece of oxydizing copper ore.   Name: Miracle • Friday, November 9, 2012  For those looking for their first clover: I find then most often in the spring when patches are growing quickly. In my experience it also depends on the kind of clover. I find 4+ leaves on white clover with the most frequency. Also don't be discouraged, the first one is always the hardest to find! Good luck!   Name: Jeff • Thursday, January 17, 2013  I'm farsighted and once in 1987 while walking along a clover lined path with a friend I actually spotted a four leaf clover while walking. The cool part was having a witness to this lucky but unlikely event.   Name: Anthea Wood • Saturday, September 7, 2013  Pleased to see all these posts about four leafed clover.   Most people I know don't believe they exist.   When I was young my family often went camping in Lancashire, UK and on one occasion I found a number of four leafed clover leaves all in one patch.  I have never found any more since.   Name: Rita • Monday, November 18, 2013  Today while walking at the West Hartford reservoir, I was fortunate enough to site my first 4 leaf clover.  I thought that was special until further along the walk, I found another 4 leaf and one 5 leaf clover.   I don't care what anyone says....One has to feel lucky!   Name: amy • Friday, February 21, 2014  I just found 14 four leaf clovers and 4 five leaf clovers! This may sound nuts but its the law of attraction, I caught myself thinking "3 leaf" as i sifted through them, and i realized that i was focusing all my energy thinking "3 leaf" , so i started thinking "4 leaf" and I swear I started pulling them suckers left and right,, Give it a try, the law of attraction is real, check out the book The Secret!!   Name: brandy reynolds • Friday, April 4, 2014  My boyfriend and I have a special clover patch in our friends yard that we tell no one about.the first time welooked we found seventeen. We found thirty yesterday and a five leaf clover too.I tape them in plastic clear tape and give them to friends and family.they put smiles on peoples faces .especially if they have never seen one before.   Name: Debbie Hoffman • Thursday, July 10, 2014  I'm also one of those people that can look down and there are 4 and 5 leaf clovers for my picking. I have to literally try to ignore the patches of clover so I don't find any. Getting out of my car today I found (21) 4 leaf clovers and (4)5 leaf clovers in just a few minutes. I had to walk away. I'm running out of books to press them in, however it is so much fun I can't stop!   Name: Tom • Tuesday, September 9, 2014  I know its an old article but I thought I'd chime in. From the way it was explained to me, the extra leaves on the clovers are actually the clover equivalent of twins/triplets. Since a patch that produces a four leaf clover already has the right genes, it's actually more probable that if you find one, you'll find another in the same patch than another patch or especially the around same area if there are a lot of bees to pollinate them properly. I've found thousands over my lifetime and I usually find them in groups. The largest group I've found was 31 within about 10 square feet.

Jim Frost  25 July, 2013                                   Picture of four-leaf clover by Joe Papp.  This may seem to be an odd time to write about four-leaf clovers, the traditional Irish lucky charms. However, clovers are currently growing full-force in my yard!  I was out doing yard work when I noticed patches of clovers. I blame my neighbor for them because, while I have patches of clover in my grass, he has patches of grass in his clover filled yard! The clovers got me thinking about Carly Barry’s post about the odds of finding four-leaf clovers. It also prompted some fun, backyard science with my daughter!  In Carly’s blog, reader comments raise a number of questions. If four-leaf clovers are so rare, how is it possible for some people to find so many? Some readers report that they regularly find four-leaf clovers. Others claim that it only takes minutes to find one, or even half a dozen! Maybe they are luckier, or perhaps there are some factors that affect their chances of finding four-leaf clovers?  One of the most important things we do in statistics is to identify the factors that affect an outcome. In this blog, I explore how it’s possible to find so many four-leaf clovers despite the low odds.  White Clovers a.k.a Trifolium Repens  Tradition holds that you are lucky if you find a white clover that has four leaves. These clovers are named after their white flowers. In their scientific name, Trifolium means three-leafed, the usual number for this species. There are other types of clovers that typically have four leaves, so watch out for imposters!  It’s widely cited that one out of every 10,000 white clovers has four-leaves. I was surprised to learn that there are even five-leaf clovers, and more! The Guinness world record for the most leaves on a clover is 56!  How Much Area Do You Need to Find a Four-Leaf Clover?  If the odds of finding a four-leaf clover are truly 1-in-10,000, how much area do you need for 10,000 clovers? I really had no idea if it was the size of a field, or a typical backyard. This point is where my 8 year-old daughter and I had some good, hands-on science fun in our backyard while learning about estimating.  As you can see in the picture, we measured out a six-inch square and laid it over a patch of fairly dense clovers. As we picked the clovers on the top layer, we noticed there was another layer of clovers below it, and another one below that. After we picked all of the clovers out of the square, we counted them.  That quarter of a square foot patch had about 200 clovers. Doing some simple math, we estimated that there are 800 clovers per square foot and 10,000 clovers can grow in just 12.5 square feet (1.2 m 2 ). For the 1-in-100,000 five-leaf clovers, you’d need 125 square feet (11.6 m 2 ).  We both thought it was going to be a much larger area, which would make finding them more difficult. However, you don’t need to scour an entire field to find a four-leaf clover. Instead, you can expect to find 10,000 clovers in a 3’ X 4’ area. That helps to explain the ease that some have of finding them!  The Probability of Finding Four-Leaf Clovers  According to probability theory, the probability of an event happening is determined in part by the type of event. In this case, I need to determine whether finding four-leaf clovers are either independent or dependent events .  An event is independent if the occurrence of the event doesn’t affect the probability of the event happening again. If you flip a coin and get a heads, you still have a 50/50 chance of getting a heads on the next coin toss.  An event is dependent if the occurrence of the event affects the probability of the event happening again. If you randomly draw a King from a deck of cards and don’t replace it, the probability of drawing a King the next time has decreased.  In terms of four-leaf clovers, if you find one four-leaf clover, does the probability of the next clover being a four-leaf clover stay the same (independent) or change (dependent)?  Researchers at the University of Georgia have discovered a gene that allows clover plants to grow a fourth leaf. Clover with this gene typically grow three leaves. However, given the correct environmental conditions (soil pH, temperature and pollution), they can sprout a fourth leaf.  Genes are inheritable. Consequently, plants in close proximity are more likely to share genes than more distant plants. Similarly, environmental conditions are more likely to be similar for plants close together. Collectively, these facts suggest that finding multiple four-leaf clovers are dependent events. If you find one, your odds of finding another one in the same area increase!  This supports the notion I found on websites that four-leaf clovers are often in hot spots, as well as the comments in Carly’s blog that mention finding four-leaf clovers in rapid succession! You can also revisit hot spots to increase your odds of finding them more quickly.  How to Find Four-Leaf Clovers    This 6' X 8' section of my neighbor's yard probably has 40,000 clovers!  Finally, let's look into the process of finding four-leaf clovers that is recommended by those who are proficient at finding them. I want to see whether this sheds any more light on how some people can find them so easily!  Websites about how to find four-leaf clovers state that you should not examine individual clovers. Instead, these sites stress that you should stand and sweep your eyes over the entire patch while you brush the clovers with your foot to ensure that you see all of the layers. The process emphasizes speed because you keep your eyes moving and the abnormal clover should stick out like a sore thumb. So, it won’t take long to look over that 3’ X 4’ patch of clover!  This process reminds me of visual inspections done by quality control specialists. These inspectors are highly trained in both subject area knowledge and the proper methods to pick out any abnormalities. Some studies have shown that the more accurate visual inspectors had fewer “eye fixations” (e.g. they keep their eyes moving), just like the four-leaf clover websites suggest!  I suspect that those who find four-leaf clovers quickly and easily have developed a skill set that is similar to trained visual inspectors. In a production process, a manufacturer doesn’t just hope that the inspectors find defects by chance, instead they develop the skills necessary for the product line.  Similarly, collectors of four-leaf clovers hone their skills to overcome the long odds of finding them by chance alone.  The Keys to Finding Many Lucky Clovers Quickly and Easily!  While exploring how some people find four-leaf clovers so easily, I found three important factors that affect the chances of finding them.  Two of these factors you can improve to your advantage. You can:   Develop and improve skills to find four-leaf clovers  Build a knowledge-base of locations that are more likely to have four-leaf clovers   While you can’t control the density of clovers, it turns out that you don’t have to look over a large area to observe 10,000 clovers.

[VIDEO] DJ Digital March 17, 2016 Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Superstition says that the four-leaf clover is thought to bring good luck to anyone who finds one, especially if found by chance. The leaves on the four-leaf clover are said to stand for faith, hope, love and luck—but that hasn't always been the case. The patron saint of Ireland (known to most as St. Patrick) used the shamrock to explain the Holy Trinity—the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. So what did the fourth leaf stand for? St. Patrick claimed that the fourth leaf meant the Grace of God, and the shamrock's allure dates as far back as Adam and Eve. If you remember correctly, the story goes that Eve took a four-leaf clover from the Garden of Eden to remind her of paradise. Express, Getty Images So we know they are unique, and we know they are rare, but just what are the odds of stumbling across a four-leaf clover in the wild? Well, science says that we're looking at about a 1 and 10,000 chance of finding a four-leaf clover; and if you find one, it may mean a few things: 1. A person who finds one will meet a future lover on the same day.  2. The clover brings good luck and protects against evil.  3. Anyone wearing a clover will be able to see fairies if they are around.  4. If you pass your clover on to someone else, your luck will double. Have you ever found a four-leaf clover?

The term is also often used for the wood-sorrel  ( Oxalis acetosella ) and Oxalis tetraphylla , a common potted plant.  For the popular 20th-century song, see " I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover ". For the 2010 Diana Vickers song, see Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree .     Four-leaf white clover ( Trifolium repens )    The four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover . According to tradition, such clovers bring good luck , [1] though it is not clear when or how that tradition got started. The earliest mention of “Fower-leafed or purple grasse” is from 1640 and simply says that it was kept in gardens because it was “good for the purples in children or others” [2] . A description from 1869 says that four-leaf clovers were “gathered at night-time during the full moon by sorceresses, who mixed it with Vervain and other ingredients, while young girls in search of a token of perfect happiness made quest of the plant by day” [3] . The first reference to luck might be from an 11-year-old girl, who wrote in an 1877 letter to St. Nicholas Magazine , “Did the fairies ever whisper in your ear, that a four-leaf clover brought good luck to the finder?” [4]     Contents    1  Occurrence  2  Cause  3  Multi-leaved cultivars  4  Other species  5  Symbolic usage  6  Meanings  7  References  8  External links     Occurrence [ edit ]  It is claimed that there are approximately 10,000 three-leaf clovers for every four-leaf clover. [5] However, an actual survey of over 5 million clovers found the real frequency to be closer to 1 in 5000. [6]  Even so, this probability has not deterred collectors who have reached records as high as 160,000 four-leaf clovers in a lifetime. However, the world record for four-leaf clovers in a single day is 72, and the record for one hour is 51, set by an American named Griffin McDowell on August 12, 2013. [7]  Clovers can have more than four leaves. Five-leaf clovers are less commonly found naturally than four-leaf clovers; [8] [9] however, they, too, have been successfully cultivated. [10] Some four-leaf clover collectors, particularly in Ireland, regard the five-leaf clover, known as a rose clover, as a particular prize. [11] In exceptionally rare cases, clovers are able to grow with six leaves and more in nature. [12] The most leaves ever found on a single clover stem ( Trifolium repens L .) is 56 and was discovered by Shigeo Obara of Hanamaki City, Iwate, Japan, on 10 May 2009. [13] [14]  Cause [ edit ]     A four-leaf clover    It is debated whether the fourth leaf is caused genetically or environmentally. Its relative rarity (1 in 5000 clovers [6] ) suggests a possible recessive gene appearing at a low frequency. Alternatively, four-leaf clovers could be caused by somatic mutation or a developmental error of environmental causes. They could also be caused by the interaction of several genes that happen to segregate in the individual plant. It is possible all four explanations could apply to individual cases. This means that multiple four-leaf clovers could be found in the same clover plant. [15]  Researchers from the University of Georgia have reported finding the gene that turns ordinary three-leaf clovers into the coveted four-leaf types. Masked by the three-leaf gene and strongly influenced by environmental condition, molecular markers now make it possible to detect the presence of the gene for four-leaves and for breeders to work with it. The results of the study, which also located two other leaf traits in the white-clover genome, were reported in the July/August 2010 edition of Crop Science , published by the Crop Science Society of America. [16]  The other leaf traits, the red fleck mark and red midrib, a herringbone pattern that runs down the center of each leaflet in a bold red color, were mapped to nearby locations, resolving a century-old question as to whether these leaf traits were controlled by one gene or two separate genes.  White clover has many genes that affect leaf color and shape, and the three in the study were very rare. These traits can be quite attractive, particularly if combined with others, and can turn clover into an ornamental plant for use in flower beds [17]  There are reports of farms in the US which specialize in four-leaf clovers, producing as many as 10,000 a day (to be sealed in plastic as "lucky charms") by introducing a genetically engineered ingredient to the plants to encourage the aberration (there are, however, widely available cultivars that regularly produce leaves with multiple leaflets – see below). [18] These are associated to Saint Patricks Day.  Multi-leaved cultivars [ edit ]     Example of a five-leaf clover    There are some cultivars of white clover ( Trifolium repens ) which regularly produce more than three leaflets, including purple-leaved T. repens "Purpurascens Quadrifolium" and green-leaved T. repens "Quadrifolium". [19]  Trifolium repens "Good Luck" is a cultivar which has three, four, or five green, dark-centered leaflets per leaf. [20]  Other species [ edit ]  Other plants may be mistaken for, or misleadingly sold as, "four-leaf clovers"; for example, Oxalis tetraphylla is a species of wood sorrel with leaves resembling a four-leaf clover. [21] [22] Other species that have been sold as "four-leaf clovers" include Marsilea quadrifolia . [23] [24]  Symbolic usage [ edit ]          The Centre parties in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Åland, Estonia, Poland and Lithuania have similar backgrounds and identities, as indicated by their similar logos, based on the four-leaf clover          This section is in a list format that may be better presented using prose .

(March 2016)      Italian automobile maker Alfa Romeo used to paint a four-leaf clover, or quadrifoglio, on the side of their racing cars. This tradition started in the 1923 Targa Florio race, when driver Ugo Sivocci decorated his car with a green clover on a white background.  Los Angeles-based space exploration company SpaceX includes a four-leaf clover on each space mission embroidered patch as a good luck charm. Inclusion of the clover has become a regular icon on SpaceX's flight patches ever since the company's first successful Falcon 1 rocket launch in 2008, which was the first mission to feature a clover "for luck" on its patch. [25]  Celtic Football Club , an association football team from Glasgow, Scotland , have used the four leaf clover as the club's official badge for over 40 years.  Former Japanese game developer studio Clover Studio used a four-leaf clover as their logo.  Several businesses and organisations use a four-leaf clover in their logos to signify Celtic origins. [26] [27] [28]  The global network of youth organizations 4-H uses a green four-leaf clover with a white H on each leaf. [29]  The logo of the New Jersey Lottery features an outline of the state in white on a green four-leaf clover printed on a lottery draw machine ball.   Meanings [ edit ]  Some folk traditions assign a different attribute to each leaf of a clover. The first leaf represents hope, the second stands for faith, the third is for love and the fourth leaf brings luck to the finder. A fifth leaf represents money, but there is no meaning as yet for the sixth leaf and above. [12] Some reports claim six to be fame and seven to be longevity, though the notions' origination is unknown.  References [ edit ]    ^  Harry Oliver (2010).

Due to their rarity, they can also be a fun souvenir to have. To find a four-leaf clover, find some clover patches in your area and scan them for a four-leaf clover. Be patient and keep looking, as four-leaf clovers are rare. If you don't find one the first time you go out hunting, keep your eyes peeled in the future. With some dedication, you should eventually find a four-leaf clover of your own.         Steps    Method  1   Locating Clover Patches           1   Do an online search for clovers in your area. If you're not sure where to find clovers in your area, do an online search for "clover patches" followed by the name of your town. You may find sites with an overview of the types of foliage in the different areas of your town. Users may also leave comments about local parks or trials on sites like Yelp, letting other people know the kinds of plants they found there.          2   Walk around local areas with a lot of foliage. If you can't find clovers online, do your own search. Walk around areas with a lot of leaves and trees, like parks and trials, to seek out clover patches. [1]   If you have a backyard, look there as well. Clovers often grow in lawns.           3   Check shady, dry areas. Clovers tend to thrive in soil that does not drain well. They also frequently grow in the shade. When out looking for clovers, check shady and dry areas for a clover patch. [2]          4   Identify a clover patch. Clover patches are comprised of plants with small green flowers circling a center point. Watch out for plants that look similar to clovers. Plants with purple circles at the center are not clovers. Also, if you see a whole patch of what look like four-leaf clovers, these are not clovers. [3] Remember, four-leaf clovers are rare. There is one four-leaf clover for every 10,000 three-leaf clover in a patch. [4]                Method  2   Searching for a Four-Leaf Clover          1   Scan the patch carefully. Do not try to look at every clover individually, as this will take far too long. Instead, stand above the patch and scan it closely. Pause if a clover jumps out at you and check to see if it has four leaves. [5]          2   Skim the surface with your hands. If scanning from a distance isn't working, crouch near the clover patch. Run your hands over the clover patch slowly. Focus in on the clovers as they pass through your fingers, checking for clovers with extra leaves. [6]          3   Push the leaves apart if you think you see a four-leaf clover. If you see what appears to be a four-leaf clover, push away the clovers surrounding it. See if it actually has four leaves. Clovers sometimes look like they have four leaves, but you're really seeing leaves from another clover clustering near it. [7]          4   Look in the same area if you find a four leaf clover. If you happen to find a four-leaf clover, keep looking in that area. Four-leaf clovers are caused by a genetic mutation. Therefore, they tend to be found close together as the seeds will spread around the same area. You may be lucky enough to find a second four-leaf clover. [8]           Method  3   Avoiding Common Mistakes          1   Don't try to look at every individual clover. Scanning the leaves works better than examining every leaf. As there are hundreds of clovers in a single patch, you won't have time to look at them all. If you scan the leaves instead, a difference in the general pattern may jump out at you. [9]          2   Look for smaller leaves on four-leaf clovers. Don't expect a four-leaf clover to have completely even leaves. Keep in mind, when scanning for a four-leaf clover, the clover's fourth leaf may be significantly smaller than the others. [10]          3   Don't get discouraged. Four-leaf clovers are incredibly rare. The more often you search, the more likely you are to find one. If you don't find a four-leaf clover on your first search, keep an eye out each time you pass a clover patch. The more often you look, the more likely you are to eventually find a four-leaf clover.

Perhaps you have a reason you might share with us as to why this time works best for you - maybe the extra leaf causes the plant to show itself differently in the rain, perhaps it sags more?

If the flowerbed is well tended, all weed plants (including clover) will also be frequently removed. However, a flowerbed that is sparse and poorly cared for might allow clover to grow.   Thanks!

If they give it to you with a good heart and the intention to pass on the luck, there is surely no reason why that luck won't rub off onto you. If they give it to you with indifference or even malice though, it might not work.   Thanks!

Four-leaf clovers are more abundant in disturbed and/or trampled areas. Look along footpaths and trails that run through a clover patch.  Mutant clovers are most prevalent in the late summer.

Home Life Hacks by fourleafclover Follow 116,029 8 27 Posted Jul. 18, 2009 Stats Introduction: How to Find a 4 Leaf Clover in 5 Minutes! I found my first 4 leaf clover on the 17th of July 2009, and it only took me five minutes! This was about the fifth time I'd gone looking with my dad. My dad said the chances of finding one were very, very poor as we were only going to be out for about half an hour. We went to an extended bit of a cemetery where there are only about 8 graves and millions of clovers! This is where I normally go looking because there are so many clovers! Note that if you do find a 4 leaf clover, look around the place where you find it. All of the mutant clovers pictured were all found within 100 square feet! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 1: Peaches!!! If you are going to look with someone else (in my case, my dad) tell them to look in a different place from you. Also, think of a codeword that you will say if you find one. I told my dad to say peaches if he found a 4 leaf clover and that I would do the same if I found a 4 leaf clover. Using codewords is a good way to communicate with the person you are looking with. After five minutes of looking, I found a four leaf clover and yelled out 'peaches!'. But how did I find it in five minutes when sometimes I search up to 2 hours and find nothing? Lets see :-) Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 2: Good Searching Skills Four leaf clovers can crop up anywhere so it's just luck if you find a 4 leaf clover. To find one, you need good searching skills and good eyes. People say that finding a four leaf clover is a luck omen as there is only 1 four leaf clover in 10000 three leafers! Always bring a book with you in case you find one. Don't bother bringing a magnifying glass with you because that achieves nothing. You will spend ages and ages looking in one patch if you look at each and every clover atom! The trick is to just glance down as you look. That way, all though you don't see every clover, gives you more chances of finding one because you see more patches. If you have good searching skills, you will find one much easier. Remember: Looking at every clover through a magnifying glass is a waste of time! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 3: Sets of Three The 3 leaf clover has three leaves (of course) and is a member of the white clover plant 'Trifolium repens'. A good tactic for finding a four leaf clover is to think about the sets. Each 'normal' clover has a set of three leaves. A four leaf clover has, well, a set of four leaves. Just think of the sets. Say each set you see in your mind as you pass the clover. If you are lucky, you will come across something that doesn't look like a set of three. Don't get your hopes up. It is probably just a three leaf clover, but with another three leaf clover underneath it. Wriggle it around. If it is still a 4 leaf clover, pick it. If it is still a 4 leaf clover when you pick it, you found one! Lucky you! If you follow the sets tactic, any mutant will really stick out! Even the smallest four leafer! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 4: 5, 6, 7, 8 Leafers Mutant clovers do not stop at four leaves. Five leaf clovers are possible, as well as six leafers, seven leafers, and maybe even eight leafers! The world record is a 21 leaf clover. Twenty-one leaves seems beyond any mutation. It must be a freak! You also find that the more leaves, the thicker the stalk. I found my first 5 leafer on the 19th of July! If you look on page 127 in the Guinness book of world records 2009, you will see the stalk of an eighteen leaf clover Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 5: Mix and Muddle The number of leaves on a clover isn't the only type of mutant clover there is. There are many, many other mutations that occur with clovers. I heard somewhere about a spade leafed clover. That will be one mutant, but a spade four leafed clover would be two mutations mixed together! A clover holds so many possibilities. And so many mutations that can be mixed! You may have a five leaf clover with one leaf in a mitten shape, two spade leaves, one upside down leaf and one 'rust' coloured leaf. (Not that all that can't happen)! But the chances of finding a clover like that would be almost minus! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 6: AHH! TWO LEAF CLOVER! Not to worry. Probably one leaf fell off. Besides, two leaf clovers don't necessarily bring bad luck. In theory, a two leaf clover could be possible, but it would be very hard to prove it was a two leaf clover. Also you could say a 1 leaf clover exists. But that would be as rare as a five leafer! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 7: I Found a 4 Leaf Clover! After you've done the tactics, you may have found one. If you are lucky, you would have. If you do find one, and you've made sure it's a REAL 4 leaf clover, scream your codeword. When I screamed my codeword, my dad thought I was joking. After you've screamed your codeword, if you want to keep it, pick it and read the next step. If you don't really care, just leave it and don't read the next step. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 8: Preserving the Clover This is probably the hardest bit of four leaf clover finding. When you first pick the clover, put it in the book, memorize the page number that you shut it (I shut it on page 35) and hold it spine upwards so that the clover doesn't fall out. When you get home, get out a big and heavy book (I used harry potter and the order of the phoenix) and put it on top of the book you shut the clover in and put it in the airing cupboard for at least a week. Clear some space in the airing cupboard and tell everyone to be careful. Maybe make a warning sign and stick it on the airing cupboard door. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 9: Frame the Clover In the week when you are preserving the clover, buy a small frame of about two inches by five inches. After the week, carefully take the big book off the little book with the clover and then take the book out spine upwards. Flip to the page with the clover on (35 in my case) and take the clover out. Slip the clover into the little frame then keep it as a good luck charm and show it all to your friends. Now you've read this, why don't you go out there looking for 4 leaf clovers? There's millions out there. Hundreds of millions! In the past two days I've put these skills to the test and found 11 more 4 leaf clovers, and a 'spade' leaf clover.

Ask Question 23  Comments admin 8 years ago Reply Hey, this is a great instructable and is very informative. Just one thing is missing... pictures! It really helps a lot when trying to follow directions so you should consider taking some photographs. Once you do that and leave me a message when you have so that we can publish your work.

Thanks!

Thanks for the cool instructable and we hope to publish this soon! ProfessorPi 23 days ago Reply When I was little in my schoolyard there was a bike rack and all around it was mutated clovers. One girl found a 9-leaf clover there, and I found 3 7-leaf clovers. It was amazing! peteandoreen1 4 months ago Reply This is like photo's of the Tasmanian Tiger, all a blur which only causes doubt.

Reyanshreedytummala 1 year ago Reply I grow 10 million cloves and I found a four leaf clover in one minute panicmose 1 year ago Reply I can't believe there are instructions for finding a 4-leaf clover!!  I used to find several almost every day in my high school courtyard. Because we found so many, we would just use thick clear packing tape on either side (like a do-it-yourself lamination). I still have a few after a decade (or so...) It still gets to me every time I hear the whole "4-leaf clover urban legend" saying!! Ashleigh12345678987654321 1 year ago Reply Im just saying, whut do u need the book 4? Great steps though NoahS10 1 year ago Reply If you're thinking long-term preservation, I think flattening a clover in a book is a good way to dry it out and prevent it from withering.  Once it's dry you should be able to keep it in a plastic sleeve or frame, as suggested in the article. jdp420 3 years ago Reply I found this 5 leaf clover in my garden today. GalaxyW1 1 year ago Reply LUCKY akaamazing 3 years ago Reply I'm all the time finding four & five leave covers! I've did this all my life! I don't find as many five leaf ones as I do four leaves! I find four or five five leaf clovers a year! I find hundreds of four leaf cloves a year! The most leaves I have ever found was when I was about ten yrs. old & it had eleven leaves on it!  I tried to preserve it but in 1975 we didn't have a lot of the things we have now much less the world wide web to tell me how to preserve it! So I guess you will have to take my word on it! My Mother did see it but she didn't care to much for my clover hunting. I would leave them in my pocket & they would come out in the dryer & make a mess! To bad I didn't get to save all the ones I have found in my life because that would have broken the world record of 160,000! Last week I was just walking in the yard & bent over & picked a seven leaf clover! I find a lot by walking & just glancing down!

Four-leaf clover   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   "Lucky clover" and "lucky leaf" redirect here. The term is also often used for the wood-sorrel  ( Oxalis acetosella ) and Oxalis tetraphylla , a common potted plant.  For the popular 20th-century song, see " I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover ". For the 2010 Diana Vickers song, see Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree .     Four-leaf white clover ( Trifolium repens )    The four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover . According to tradition, such clovers bring good luck , [1] though it is not clear when or how that tradition got started. The earliest mention of “Fower-leafed or purple grasse” is from 1640 and simply says that it was kept in gardens because it was “good for the purples in children or others” [2] . A description from 1869 says that four-leaf clovers were “gathered at night-time during the full moon by sorceresses, who mixed it with Vervain and other ingredients, while young girls in search of a token of perfect happiness made quest of the plant by day” [3] . The first reference to luck might be from an 11-year-old girl, who wrote in an 1877 letter to St. Nicholas Magazine , “Did the fairies ever whisper in your ear, that a four-leaf clover brought good luck to the finder?” [4]     Contents    1  Occurrence  2  Cause  3  Multi-leaved cultivars  4  Other species  5  Symbolic usage  6  Meanings  7  References  8  External links     Occurrence [ edit ]  It is claimed that there are approximately 10,000 three-leaf clovers for every four-leaf clover. [5] However, an actual survey of over 5 million clovers found the real frequency to be closer to 1 in 5000. [6]  Even so, this probability has not deterred collectors who have reached records as high as 160,000 four-leaf clovers in a lifetime. However, the world record for four-leaf clovers in a single day is 72, and the record for one hour is 51, set by an American named Griffin McDowell on August 12, 2013. [7]  Clovers can have more than four leaves. Five-leaf clovers are less commonly found naturally than four-leaf clovers; [8] [9] however, they, too, have been successfully cultivated. [10] Some four-leaf clover collectors, particularly in Ireland, regard the five-leaf clover, known as a rose clover, as a particular prize. [11] In exceptionally rare cases, clovers are able to grow with six leaves and more in nature. [12] The most leaves ever found on a single clover stem ( Trifolium repens L .) is 56 and was discovered by Shigeo Obara of Hanamaki City, Iwate, Japan, on 10 May 2009. [13] [14]  Cause [ edit ]     A four-leaf clover    It is debated whether the fourth leaf is caused genetically or environmentally. Its relative rarity (1 in 5000 clovers [6] ) suggests a possible recessive gene appearing at a low frequency. Alternatively, four-leaf clovers could be caused by somatic mutation or a developmental error of environmental causes. They could also be caused by the interaction of several genes that happen to segregate in the individual plant. It is possible all four explanations could apply to individual cases. This means that multiple four-leaf clovers could be found in the same clover plant. [15]  Researchers from the University of Georgia have reported finding the gene that turns ordinary three-leaf clovers into the coveted four-leaf types. Masked by the three-leaf gene and strongly influenced by environmental condition, molecular markers now make it possible to detect the presence of the gene for four-leaves and for breeders to work with it. The results of the study, which also located two other leaf traits in the white-clover genome, were reported in the July/August 2010 edition of Crop Science , published by the Crop Science Society of America. [16]  The other leaf traits, the red fleck mark and red midrib, a herringbone pattern that runs down the center of each leaflet in a bold red color, were mapped to nearby locations, resolving a century-old question as to whether these leaf traits were controlled by one gene or two separate genes.  White clover has many genes that affect leaf color and shape, and the three in the study were very rare. These traits can be quite attractive, particularly if combined with others, and can turn clover into an ornamental plant for use in flower beds [17]  There are reports of farms in the US which specialize in four-leaf clovers, producing as many as 10,000 a day (to be sealed in plastic as "lucky charms") by introducing a genetically engineered ingredient to the plants to encourage the aberration (there are, however, widely available cultivars that regularly produce leaves with multiple leaflets – see below). [18] These are associated to Saint Patricks Day.  Multi-leaved cultivars [ edit ]     Example of a five-leaf clover    There are some cultivars of white clover ( Trifolium repens ) which regularly produce more than three leaflets, including purple-leaved T. repens "Purpurascens Quadrifolium" and green-leaved T. repens "Quadrifolium". [19]  Trifolium repens "Good Luck" is a cultivar which has three, four, or five green, dark-centered leaflets per leaf. [20]  Other species [ edit ]  Other plants may be mistaken for, or misleadingly sold as, "four-leaf clovers"; for example, Oxalis tetraphylla is a species of wood sorrel with leaves resembling a four-leaf clover. [21] [22] Other species that have been sold as "four-leaf clovers" include Marsilea quadrifolia . [23] [24]  Symbolic usage [ edit ]          The Centre parties in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Åland, Estonia, Poland and Lithuania have similar backgrounds and identities, as indicated by their similar logos, based on the four-leaf clover          This section is in a list format that may be better presented using prose .  You can help by converting this section to prose, if appropriate . Editing help is available.  (March 2016)      Italian automobile maker Alfa Romeo used to paint a four-leaf clover, or quadrifoglio, on the side of their racing cars. This tradition started in the 1923 Targa Florio race, when driver Ugo Sivocci decorated his car with a green clover on a white background.  Los Angeles-based space exploration company SpaceX includes a four-leaf clover on each space mission embroidered patch as a good luck charm. Inclusion of the clover has become a regular icon on SpaceX's flight patches ever since the company's first successful Falcon 1 rocket launch in 2008, which was the first mission to feature a clover "for luck" on its patch. [25]  Celtic Football Club , an association football team from Glasgow, Scotland , have used the four leaf clover as the club's official badge for over 40 years.  Former Japanese game developer studio Clover Studio used a four-leaf clover as their logo.  Several businesses and organisations use a four-leaf clover in their logos to signify Celtic origins. [26] [27] [28]  The global network of youth organizations 4-H uses a green four-leaf clover with a white H on each leaf. [29]  The logo of the New Jersey Lottery features an outline of the state in white on a green four-leaf clover printed on a lottery draw machine ball.   Meanings [ edit ]  Some folk traditions assign a different attribute to each leaf of a clover. The first leaf represents hope, the second stands for faith, the third is for love and the fourth leaf brings luck to the finder. A fifth leaf represents money, but there is no meaning as yet for the sixth leaf and above. [12] Some reports claim six to be fame and seven to be longevity, though the notions' origination is unknown.  References [ edit ]    ^  Harry Oliver (2010).

Posted 1:38 pm, March 15, 2014, by Bailey Woolum KFOR-TV    Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn Reddit Email       This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.           ×  What’s so lucky about a four-leaf clover?        What’s so lucky about a four-leaf clover?  “Well, you’re lucky to find one in the first place,” said Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation President Stephen Prescott, M.D. “The symbolism of the four-leaf clover may be everywhere, but a real one is actually a rarity.”  About 1 specimen in 10,000 of Trifolium repens (aka white clover) has four leaves instead of the usual three.  Trifolium is Latin for “three leaf.”  “Saint Patrick was said to use the shamrock, the three-leaf clover, to teach about the Holy Trinity,” Prescott said. “Whereas the four-leaf version is supposed to stand for faith, hope, love and luck.”  It’s said that only by finding one accidentally is a four-leaf clover lucky, he said, but the reason for the extra leaf is pure science.  “The cause of the fourth leaf is likely genetic. Because it’s so rare, it might be a recessive gene—the way red hair appears only occasionally in some families—or some type of mutation,” Prescott said. “And that’s something OMRF scientists have plenty of experience studying.”  Inside each cell in the human body there’s a copy of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) made up of billions of base pairs of proteins.  “About 99.5 percent of human DNA is identical, but the differences in that .5 percent are what make us individuals,” Prescott said. “Changes in the DNA are called mutations and we all have them. Some make no difference at all, while others are linked to everything from hair color and height to different diseases.”  Researchers at OMRF use patient samples to find genetic mutations related to autoimmune diseases, including lupus, Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as cancer and developmental disorders.  “By understanding how our genes can cause diseases, we hope to find new ways to predict and prevent the onset of illnesses or find new treatments for diseases we already have,” he said.  In 2010, scientists at the University of Georgia found and manipulated a gene that produces a fourth leaf on Trifolium repens .  “But, much like our work, I suspect it was more than luck that led them to that discovery,” Prescott said.

Keep the Luck o' the Irish With You Year Round: How to Preserve a Four Leaf Clover!  Arts & Culture , Family & Parenting , Seasonal & Current Events   By Chelsea Triola Published: March 13 2014    LongIsland.com           If you're lucky enough to find a four leaf clover, be sure to preserve it by following the steps below!   Print   Email       March is a month full of fun St. Patrick’s Day activities that both adults and children can enjoy together. There are tons of events and parades all across the island that are perfect for a weekend out with the family. If you’re looking to stay close to home but still have an eventful day, we have put together a list of steps on how to preserve four leaf clovers!  Four leaf clovers are especially lucky and people feel the luck when they find them. That’s if they find them! This is why a lot of people like to preserve their clovers so they can keep the luck forever. You can preserve them and put them in a frame to put up as décor in your home. If you're interested in a more kid-friendly craft, preseve your four leaf clover into a laminated bookmark. Choose from the two fun crafts or do both by following the instructions below:   Preserving Four Leaf Clovers in A Picture Frame   1. First, you must find a four leaf clover. If you’re lucky enough to find one, you will probably find another. Most of the time the four leaf clovers are found together, or nearby from one another.   2. Press the clovers. After you find your lucky clovers, it is important to press them as soon as possible. Without pressing them, the clovers can wilt and fold which won’t look as nice. There are a couple of different ways you can press your clovers:    Press in between sheets of paper.   Press in the pages of a book you no longer care about or underneath a large textbook.   Weigh them down with heavy books.    3. Once pressed, handle with care and place on paper. Paint your clover with a few drops of green food coloring which will enhance the color. This step is optional but encouraged so your clover won’t lose its bright color in a few weeks.   4. Allow the clover to dry overnight. Once dried, repeat the step above with fresh paper.   5. Find the perfect picture frame. Once you have your frame, clean both sides of the glass and place it on a clean rag and allow it to air dry over night. Make sure the glass is cleaned properly, once the clover is inside you will not be able to clean it again.   6. Choose an acid-free paper to mount the clover.   7. Lay the frame face-down on the paper, without the glass, and trace the inside of the frame.  8. Cut the paper along the traced line. This will ensure that the paper fills the frame but does not cover all of the glass. If you’re using a mat instead of paper, trim the mat instead using the same process.   9. Place a small amount of acid-free glue in the middle of the clover and press it down gently onto the paper.  10. Spray the entire paper with an acid-free, UV-resistant sealant.  11. Lay the paper onto the mat and tape in place with acid-free tape. If you’re not using a mat, you can skip this step.  12. Cut a piece of Mylar the same size as the paper or mat.  13. Center the mounted clover face-down onto the glass so that an even rim of glass appears around the paper or mat.  14. Place the plastic Mylar on top.  15. Seal the mounted clover to the frame with aluminum tape. Be sure that the tape adheres to the glass along with the paper. Make sure not to misalign the tape so it is not visible on the front of the glass.  16. Assemble the frame. Then put your lucky clover on display and enjoy!   Preserving Four Leaf Clover into A Laminated Bookmark   1. Follow steps 1-4 above for this craft as well!  Overview: Find your four leaf clover and press it inbetween paper or the pages of a book to flatten it out. Be sure to add the food coloring to the clover so the brightness lasts longer. Let dry overnight and repeat food coloring step with fresh paper.   2. Create your bookmark. Have the kids cut out their own rectangular shaped bookmark. They can decorate it if they'd like or leave blank so the clover can stand out. It's best to use a thick paper so your bookmark is not flimsy.   3. Use a gluestick to glue your four leaf clover to the bookmark. This will ensure that it stays put. If you place laminate over them without glue, the clovers will lift up off the paper.   4. Place laminate over the bookmark. Do this carefully then trim off any of the excess laminate. Voila! Your bookmark is ready to use!  There are a few other interesting ways to preserve a clover along with different places to put them. Some make pieces of jewelry out of them, allowing their luck to stay with them wherever they go, and some put them in the family photo album. You can get creative and preserve them in cool places such as a bottle cap and place them as decoration in your home.  Make it a fun and educational time with the family by allowing the kids to help out while telling them a bit about the process. Discuss St. Patrick’s Day together and see who can come up with other fun activities to do all month long!

Home Life Hacks by fourleafclover Follow 116,029 8 27 Posted Jul. 18, 2009 Stats Introduction: How to Find a 4 Leaf Clover in 5 Minutes! I found my first 4 leaf clover on the 17th of July 2009, and it only took me five minutes! This was about the fifth time I'd gone looking with my dad. My dad said the chances of finding one were very, very poor as we were only going to be out for about half an hour. We went to an extended bit of a cemetery where there are only about 8 graves and millions of clovers! This is where I normally go looking because there are so many clovers! Note that if you do find a 4 leaf clover, look around the place where you find it. All of the mutant clovers pictured were all found within 100 square feet! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 1: Peaches!!! If you are going to look with someone else (in my case, my dad) tell them to look in a different place from you. Also, think of a codeword that you will say if you find one. I told my dad to say peaches if he found a 4 leaf clover and that I would do the same if I found a 4 leaf clover. Using codewords is a good way to communicate with the person you are looking with. After five minutes of looking, I found a four leaf clover and yelled out 'peaches!'. But how did I find it in five minutes when sometimes I search up to 2 hours and find nothing? Lets see :-) Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 2: Good Searching Skills Four leaf clovers can crop up anywhere so it's just luck if you find a 4 leaf clover. To find one, you need good searching skills and good eyes. People say that finding a four leaf clover is a luck omen as there is only 1 four leaf clover in 10000 three leafers! Always bring a book with you in case you find one. Don't bother bringing a magnifying glass with you because that achieves nothing. You will spend ages and ages looking in one patch if you look at each and every clover atom! The trick is to just glance down as you look. That way, all though you don't see every clover, gives you more chances of finding one because you see more patches. If you have good searching skills, you will find one much easier. Remember: Looking at every clover through a magnifying glass is a waste of time! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 3: Sets of Three The 3 leaf clover has three leaves (of course) and is a member of the white clover plant 'Trifolium repens'. A good tactic for finding a four leaf clover is to think about the sets. Each 'normal' clover has a set of three leaves. A four leaf clover has, well, a set of four leaves. Just think of the sets. Say each set you see in your mind as you pass the clover. If you are lucky, you will come across something that doesn't look like a set of three. Don't get your hopes up. It is probably just a three leaf clover, but with another three leaf clover underneath it. Wriggle it around. If it is still a 4 leaf clover, pick it. If it is still a 4 leaf clover when you pick it, you found one! Lucky you! If you follow the sets tactic, any mutant will really stick out! Even the smallest four leafer! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 4: 5, 6, 7, 8 Leafers Mutant clovers do not stop at four leaves. Five leaf clovers are possible, as well as six leafers, seven leafers, and maybe even eight leafers! The world record is a 21 leaf clover. Twenty-one leaves seems beyond any mutation. It must be a freak! You also find that the more leaves, the thicker the stalk. I found my first 5 leafer on the 19th of July! If you look on page 127 in the Guinness book of world records 2009, you will see the stalk of an eighteen leaf clover Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 5: Mix and Muddle The number of leaves on a clover isn't the only type of mutant clover there is. There are many, many other mutations that occur with clovers. I heard somewhere about a spade leafed clover. That will be one mutant, but a spade four leafed clover would be two mutations mixed together! A clover holds so many possibilities. And so many mutations that can be mixed! You may have a five leaf clover with one leaf in a mitten shape, two spade leaves, one upside down leaf and one 'rust' coloured leaf. (Not that all that can't happen)! But the chances of finding a clover like that would be almost minus! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 6: AHH! TWO LEAF CLOVER! Not to worry. Probably one leaf fell off. Besides, two leaf clovers don't necessarily bring bad luck. In theory, a two leaf clover could be possible, but it would be very hard to prove it was a two leaf clover. Also you could say a 1 leaf clover exists. But that would be as rare as a five leafer! Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 7: I Found a 4 Leaf Clover! After you've done the tactics, you may have found one. If you are lucky, you would have. If you do find one, and you've made sure it's a REAL 4 leaf clover, scream your codeword. When I screamed my codeword, my dad thought I was joking. After you've screamed your codeword, if you want to keep it, pick it and read the next step. If you don't really care, just leave it and don't read the next step. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 8: Preserving the Clover This is probably the hardest bit of four leaf clover finding. When you first pick the clover, put it in the book, memorize the page number that you shut it (I shut it on page 35) and hold it spine upwards so that the clover doesn't fall out. When you get home, get out a big and heavy book (I used harry potter and the order of the phoenix) and put it on top of the book you shut the clover in and put it in the airing cupboard for at least a week. Clear some space in the airing cupboard and tell everyone to be careful. Maybe make a warning sign and stick it on the airing cupboard door. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 9: Frame the Clover In the week when you are preserving the clover, buy a small frame of about two inches by five inches. After the week, carefully take the big book off the little book with the clover and then take the book out spine upwards. Flip to the page with the clover on (35 in my case) and take the clover out. Slip the clover into the little frame then keep it as a good luck charm and show it all to your friends. Now you've read this, why don't you go out there looking for 4 leaf clovers? There's millions out there. Hundreds of millions! In the past two days I've put these skills to the test and found 11 more 4 leaf clovers, and a 'spade' leaf clover.

Great steps though NoahS10 1 year ago Reply If you're thinking long-term preservation, I think flattening a clover in a book is a good way to dry it out and prevent it from withering.  Once it's dry you should be able to keep it in a plastic sleeve or frame, as suggested in the article. jdp420 3 years ago Reply I found this 5 leaf clover in my garden today.

I tried to preserve it but in 1975 we didn't have a lot of the things we have now much less the world wide web to tell me how to preserve it! So I guess you will have to take my word on it! My Mother did see it but she didn't care to much for my clover hunting. I would leave them in my pocket & they would come out in the dryer & make a mess! To bad I didn't get to save all the ones I have found in my life because that would have broken the world record of 160,000! Last week I was just walking in the yard & bent over & picked a seven leaf clover! I find a lot by walking & just glancing down!

We asked the experts to find out.                              By Laura Richards             Pinterest         Facebook         Twitter                         Google+             Pinterest         Facebook         Twitter                         Google+                  Photography by: Aaron Dyer    How would you feel if you were walking in your yard and found a four-leaf clover? Lucky, right?    Well, the actual chances of finding one is 1 in 10,000. Dr. John Frett , Professor of Landscape Horticulture and Director of the University of Delaware Botanic Gardens, says, "It is not that unusual. The 1 in 10,000 chance is for a 'typical' group of plants, a group that represents the statistical norm for the population. Individual plants vary in their propensity to produce the fourth leaflet, just like people vary in height. Breeders have selected varieties that produce as much as 50 percent of the leaves with four leaflets. Combined with the fact that clover spreads by underground stems, a large patch of clover can grow with an increased ability to produce greater than normal leaves with four leaflets leading to an increased rate of discovering the elusive four-leaf clover."    Four-leaf clovers represent faith, love, and luck. According to Clovers Online , authentic four-leaf clovers come from the White Clover plant. Many people believe that a shamrock is a four-leaf clover, but they are not the same. Irish tradition holds that the shamrock or three-leaf clover represents the Holy Trinity: one for the Father, one for the Son, and one for the Holy Spirit. Another way of identifying a real four-leaf clover is that the fourth leaflet is usually smaller than the other three leaflets.     [DIY: Say "Happy St. Patrick's Day" With Four-Leaf Clover Cards]     Suzi Mekhitarian who lives in a suburb of Sydney, Australia found 21 four-leaf clovers in her front yard back in 2014. The Australian Botanic Garden Director of Science Brett Summerell said that Mekhitarian's patch of clover is unusual. "Instead of the dominant gene characteristics of the plant being three leaves, it is four, increasing the chances of this occurring in a single patch,'' he said. "There hasn't been a great deal of research into this so nobody knows why this occurs but I hear about it happening every five or six years." No matter what the facts, finding a four-leaf clover is still a sign of luck and worth keeping.

March 17, 2016 | Elizabeth Knowles                  Photo credit: pixabay.com     And how can you improve them?  It’s Saint Patrick’s Day and, as Irish legend would have it, finding a four-leaf clover would make you extra lucky. In the original story, Saint Patrick gave a four-leaf clover to a group of his followers and told them that the fourth leaf was put there by God to bring luck — the first three leaves represented hope, faith, and love.  So if you’re down on your luck and are looking for a four-leaf clover, you might be wondering what your chances of actually finding one are. The short answer is: 1 in 10,000. The long answer involves knowing that the gene for a fourth leaf is inheritable, which means that if you find one four-leaf clover , you are more likely to find a second one in the same area. Furthermore, just having the gene isn’t enough, a clover has to sprout in the right conditions — temperature, pollution, soil pH — to grow a fourth leaf, which further suggests that they are likely to grow in similar areas.  SEE ALSO: The Science Behind Our Stubborn Superstitions  If we go back to the simple assumption that the likelihood that any particular clover has four leaves in 1 in 10,000, how big an area would you have to search to be statistically likely to find one? About 12.9 square feet or 1.2 square meters, according to the Scientific American video below.  In the video, editor Eric R. Olson explains that it would take far too long to examine every single clover and that you are actually best to glance them over and let any peculiarities pop out. You should also remember that there are multiple layers of clovers. Technical writer Jim Frost recommends brushing the area you are looking at with your foot to reveal the plants hidden underneath.  Did you know that the four leaves aren’t actually leaves at all? They are leaflets that together all make a single leaf. Thus, whether your clover has three, four or even 56 (the world record) leaflets, it is really a one-leaf clover.  Good luck!

According to Irish tradition, those who find a four-leaf clover are destined for good luck, as each leaf in the clover symbolizes good omens for faith, hope, love, and luck for the finder.  A lesser-known fact about four-leaf clovers is that they aren’t the luckiest symbol after all. Irish legend indicates that those who find a five -leaf clover will actually have more luck and financial success than those who just find a four-leaf clover.  However, good luck can be hard to come by if you’re only relying on finding a four-leaf clover, let alone a five-leaf clover! The estimated statistical odds of finding a four-leaf clover on your first try is 10,000 to 1, and the odds skyrocket to 1,000,000 to 1 if you’re looking to find a five-leaf clover on your first try. (The majority of the clovers you see outside have only three leaves.)  Suppose you want to delve deeper into descriptive statistics and compare the odds of finding a four-leaf clover to the odds of finding a five-leaf clover. In what is known as an odds ratio, you can compare the odds of two events, where the odds of an event equals the probability-the-event-occurs divided by the probability-it-does-not-occur.  In this case, you would find that your odds ratio is 100, showing that it is much more likely for you to find a four-leaf than a five-leaf clover. You can conclude that the odds of finding a four-leaf clover are 100 times greater than your odds of finding a five-leaf clover. (But keep in mind the odds here: it’s still pretty difficult to find a four-leaf clover, especially over a three-leaf clover!)  Why Are Odds Ratios Important?  Odds ratios are not just important for comparing the odds of two events (like we did above with the clovers)—they also play an important role in logistic regression. With binary logistic regression ( Stat > Regression > Binary Logistic Regression in Minitab Statistical Software ), you can investigate the relationship between a binary response and one or more predictors. You can then use the odds ratio for the predictors to quantify how each predictor affects the probabilities of each response.  For example, suppose you are analyzing data from people who have found four-leaf clovers to determine whether the finder’s gender and age affect their finding abilities. You could create a logistic regression model with the following variables:      Variable   Type   Description    Find  Binary response  Equals 0 if the person did not find, and 1 if the person did find    Gender  Binary response  Equals 0 if the person is male, and 1 if the person is female    Age  Continuous predictor  Equals the person’s age     Suppose the logistic regression procedure declares both predictors to be significant. If gender has an odds ratio of 2.0, you conclude that the odds of a woman finding a four-leaf clover is twice the odds of a man finding a four-leaf clover. If age has an odds ratio of 1.05, you conclude that, for each additional year of the finder’s age, the odds of finding increase by 5%.  For each predictor variable in the logistic regression model, Minitab displays an odds ratio and a confidence interval for the odds ratio.  Of course, this is only a hypothetical example!  I’m not sure your age or gender really matters—I think finding a four-leaf clover is all about LUCK.  And that's pretty difficult to quantify!

Then the days before yesterday I found 2 four leaf clovers, and the again just yesterday I once again found 7 four leaf clovers and one five leaf clover!! I beg to differ I know that some people go their whole lives and never find not even one, which used to be the case when i was younger until I reached my early 30's. Now I just seem to be able to find them most of the time. In the past I have also found quite a few 6 leaf clovers and several 7 leaf clovers. I have even found 2 leaf clovers. I think once or twice I have even found clovers with 8 and 9 leafs I don't know if I just naturally find the clovers or if they find me?   Name: Carly Barry • Monday, March 26, 2012  Wow! I'm impressed Rita! Congratulations on your many lucky clover finds. Like I say above-- I think finding lucky clovers is really all about luck (and that's pretty hard to quantify!). Can you share any secrets to your success? I'd love to increase my odds of finding one :)   Name: Maggie • Friday, April 20, 2012  I don't know about odds ratios, but I can find 4 leafs easier than most people. Some days I find a dozen or more without even really trying as they catch my eye while I am walking past. I believe it is a function of field discrimination, as I can easily see them in patches when others cannot unless I point them out.   Name: Nancy Kimes • Wednesday, May 2, 2012  The first four leaf clover I ever found was in Peru in 1999, then I found 2 in Mount Shasta, CA. I am back in Peru and today I found 7 four leaf clovers and 1, 5 leaf clover. What are the odds of that? Peru has always been a magical place... a spiritual jouney for me. But truly, what are the odds?   Name: Rachael • Thursday, May 3, 2012  I just found 5 four-leaf clovers and 1 five-leaf clover within 3minutes.  That happened when I got out of my car right after work, which before I left to go to this morning I found a four leaf clover.  That is 6 four leaf ans 1 five leaf clovers in one day.  I think my lawn has mutated clovers.   Name: Carly Barry • Friday, May 4, 2012  Hi Nancy! It's challenging to figure out the odds of finding 7 4 leaf clovers and 1 5 leaf clover because those events are likely dependent, and without any sense of how those events are dependent, it's hard to calculate the probability. (For example, did you find all the clovers (both four and five-leaf) in close proximity or in the same general area? If so, this makes your events dependent.)  However, if the above events in Peru happened independent of each other, you can just multiply the odds of each event (odds of finding 7 four-leafs multiplied by the odds of finding 1 five leaf) to obtain your answer. (For independent events, the probability that all events will occur is the product of their individual probabilities).  I think you'll find that the probability of you finding 7 four-leaf clovers and 1 five-leaf clover on your first try will be very, very low! Thanks for reading my blog!   Name: Tom • Sunday, May 6, 2012  Yesterday between my girls, my wife, and I we found 33 four leafs and 2 five leafs. I was telling our neighbor about this and she had never seen one. I went back, looked for less than a minute and brought one back to her. She was definitely impressed.   Name: Carly Barry • Saturday, May 12, 2012  Hi Tom, I'm impressed too! Thanks for reading and commenting! -Carly   Name: Darlene • Wednesday, May 16, 2012  My son is now 24... He has always been able to find 4 leaf clovers very easily. On the day he was leaving for a tour of duty in Iraq he found 26! (He came home safe!)  I myself found 2 this Saturday, and 1 Monday, without looking for them!   We were given the news today that my husbands bone scan was clear... His cancer has not spread to his bones!  I don''t know what the odds are, but they have always seemed to be connected to good luck for our family!!   Name: Carly Barry • Wednesday, May 16, 2012  Darlene - I'm happy to hear your son has returned home safely and your husband's prognosis includes good news! It seems that you and your son have really beaten the odds in finding so many four-leaf clovers! I hope good luck continues to come your way. Thank you for reading!   Name: Janet • Friday, May 25, 2012  I have found over 15 four leaf clovers without trying to find them within the last month and today I found 2 five leaf clovers.   Name: Patricia • Wednesday, May 30, 2012  In the past 30 years I have found around about 2000.00 I find one just about every time I go by a clover patch.   Name: Carly Barry • Wednesday, May 30, 2012  Interesting! I'm surprised to hear of so many of you finding high amounts of not only four-leaf clovers, but five-leaf clovers! Are you finding the lucky clovers in the same areas over and over again?  It's also interesting to see it demonstrated that five-leafs are generally harder to find than four-leafs.   Name: Doug • Saturday, June 2, 2012  Your article says that the odds of finding a 4 leaf clover are 1 in 10,000 and the odds of finding a 5 leaf clover are 1 in 1,000,000. On Wednesday the 30th of May, believe it or not, I had the good fortune of finding 7, 4 leaf clovers & 1, 5 leaf clover without any effort of looking for them.   Name: sandra • Thursday, June 7, 2012  I have a patch of 4 leaf clovers in my front yard. I have found a few in my back yard.  Today, I found 2 five leaf clovers in the patch in the front yard.  Maybe I will win the lottery????   Name: Clyde • Saturday, June 16, 2012  The picture of those clovers are wrong. Genuine 4-leaf, 5-leaf, etc. clovers come from the white clover plant. Those pictured are the "imposter" ones.   Name: Carly Barry • Monday, June 18, 2012  Hi Clyde - Thanks for pointing this out! I wasn't aware that most 4 and 5 leaf clovers came from the white clover plant.   Name: Tony Wargo • Wednesday, June 20, 2012  Hi Carly, I made this video last week and wanted to know your perspective on it. In it, I walk right up to a 4-Leaf clover as my first find and then immediately find a 6-Leaf clover. I proceed to find many 5 and 4 leaf clovers.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PPNVtrqaLQ  I have always had an unexplanable ability to tap into a source of energy that I use to find clovers.  I actually wrote a book that was recently published called, "Lucky Life Lessons: A Guide to Cultivating Luck and Positive Energy into Your Life"  I also sell 4-Leaf clovers at: www.artofwargo.com  I'm just curious to hear a statistical analysis about my "ability"  Tony Wargo   Name: Carly • Thursday, June 21, 2012  Hi Tony - Cool video! I'm not sure I've ever heard of anyone finding as many 4, 5, and even 6-leaf clovers in one outing before! Do you frequently find so many lucky clovers at one time? I'm also curious to whether or not you find the clovers in different locations (different cities miles apart or in the same general location each time?)  Statistically, you seem to be beating the odds over and over again! Since you've found so many lucky clovers, have you noticed an increase in personal luck and good fortune?   Name: Marlene Hughes • Friday, July 6, 2012  I have been collecting four, five, six leaf clovers for three years now. The other day I found three-7 leaf clovers in one patch!!! I was so excited.  Finding clovers in my own yard is so therapuetic for me, I am sad when the snow falls and I have to wait until breakup to start looking again:-)   Name: Carly • Friday, July 6, 2012  Hi Marlene - thanks for your comment! Wow, finding three 7-leaf clovers in one patch must be extra lucky! I'm sure the odds of such an event are really low!   Name: Lesley • Monday, July 9, 2012  I found one four leaf clover today and so excited   Name: charie L • Tuesday, July 10, 2012  Hi. maybe nothing out of the ordenary but i've got a 3 leaf, 4 leaf & 5 leaf & their stems all come from the SAME stalk & were joined to the same root.   Name: marylee • Tuesday, July 24, 2012  I just googled  'finding a four leaf clover', and found this article.  I have found many four leaf clovers in my yard.  I don't go looking for them because every time I do, I never find any.  I find them as I'm walking down my walkway to my car or from my car.  I feel compelled to look down and see a four leaf clover.  I am a visual person, so maybe that has something to do with it. I see alot of people seem to find more than one in the same spot.  I still believe that it brings luck, as up to now, I have had very good luck and I'm  57 years old. ( I'd like to believe this.)  heee   Name: Lynn Downey • Thursday, August 2, 2012  I find four-leaf clovers everywhere, and have found many other 5, 6, and 7 -leaf clovers. My youngest child finds them also, he is 11 year old now. They do come up same place every year if you have them in your yard. I just look down and there they are, I live in Iowa, I've found them in fields, yards, parks, out hot air ballooning. I do consider myself a very lucky person. I've always said if I was at concert of 100,000 people and they threw a frisbe, it would hit me! How do others save their clovers? I put them on paper and tape them down with scotch tape and write date and where found. But older ones seem to not stay after awhile. Lynn   Name: Deborah • Saturday, August 4, 2012  I am so excited I found 5-5 Leaf clovers and 5-4 leaf clovers in a patch in my back yard !!! I am going to look for more tomorrow in the area I found the others as darkness was falling an I wasent able to thoughly look through the patch.   Name: Carly Barry • Monday, August 6, 2012  @ Lynn- I've found a good way to save clovers is to dry them like you would flowers, and then store them between the pages of a book.   Name: Bonnie Anne Jewell • Saturday, August 11, 2012  On Friday, July 27 2012 my 16 month old granddaughter, Trinity pulled up a bunch of clovers and to my surprise there were three, four leaf clovers.  We were at a children's park, in Portsmouth,NH.  Then we went back on Thursday, August 9, 2012, to the same area and I found four more, four leaf clovers. I have them pressed in wax paper with date and place found. I've never had luck with taping any plant type materials, but wax paper works great.  Just use two pieces of paper, put the clover, flower,leaf or any plant between them, then place a heavy object over the entire object.   Let it sit there,  for as long as it takes for that plant to completely dry out.  Now, your ART work can be put into a beautiful picture frame for everyone to see how LUCKY we all are!   Name: Doug Van Reeth • Wednesday, August 15, 2012  My wife and I walk our dog every morning to the end of our cul-de-sac here in Portland Maine. Over the summer I've casually collected about 16 four-leaf clovers in this huge patch. This morning I reached down to pluck a four-leafer, and there beside it was a five-leafer! And then another, and then...a THIRD five-leafer. In a patch of clover 12 inches square we found 3 four-leafers and 3 five-leafers! The Mutant Patch! What are those odds?! Doug Van Reeth   Name: Carly Barry • Monday, August 20, 2012  Hi Doug! It's challenging to figure out those exact odds because each event you list is dependent (found in the same general area, same time of day, etc.).  However, if you read the comments above, you'll see that many people find multiple lucky clovers in the same patch over time. So maybe there is something to this -  the odds might be a bit  better for finding multiple over time in the same proximity over multiple tries, but I can't really say for sure. (Also, keep in mind the odds that I list in the blog post are for finding a 4 or 5 leaf clover on your "first try.")  Thanks for reading!   Name: pam gray • Friday, September 7, 2012  I have always found clovers easily. I have 4s 5s and a few 6s. On my wedding anniversary a few weeks ago I found 28 within 20 min. 5 of those were 5 leaf. I have found them in Pa. and Ca. where my son lives. I also believe its thereputic. I give many away, it makes people happy!   Name: Terri • Saturday, September 8, 2012  Over the last 2 years, I have found many 4 leaf clovers. I walk my dog every day, and now I can't pass a patch of clover without looking down. It seems interesting to me that if I bend down to look, I can't find them very easily, but just walking along and looking casually, they "jump out at me"! The first time I found a 5-leafer I was ecstatic.  When I found a single branch with 3, 4 and 5 leaf clovers on it, I brought it home and put it in a glass. It grew for quite a while, and actually produced NEW 4 leafs on it. Yesterday I found my first SIX leaf clover - I'm amazed at how many other people are finding them too! (By the way, the last 2 years do seem to have been very lucky for me...)   Name: Diane • Wednesday, October 17, 2012  In the first few minutes of a trip to a beautiful island I found one without looking for it.  It just happened to be growing in the rubble of an old smelter beside a piece of oxydizing copper ore.   Name: Miracle • Friday, November 9, 2012  For those looking for their first clover: I find then most often in the spring when patches are growing quickly. In my experience it also depends on the kind of clover. I find 4+ leaves on white clover with the most frequency. Also don't be discouraged, the first one is always the hardest to find! Good luck!   Name: Jeff • Thursday, January 17, 2013  I'm farsighted and once in 1987 while walking along a clover lined path with a friend I actually spotted a four leaf clover while walking. The cool part was having a witness to this lucky but unlikely event.   Name: Anthea Wood • Saturday, September 7, 2013  Pleased to see all these posts about four leafed clover.   Most people I know don't believe they exist.   When I was young my family often went camping in Lancashire, UK and on one occasion I found a number of four leafed clover leaves all in one patch.  I have never found any more since.   Name: Rita • Monday, November 18, 2013  Today while walking at the West Hartford reservoir, I was fortunate enough to site my first 4 leaf clover.  I thought that was special until further along the walk, I found another 4 leaf and one 5 leaf clover.   I don't care what anyone says....One has to feel lucky!   Name: amy • Friday, February 21, 2014  I just found 14 four leaf clovers and 4 five leaf clovers! This may sound nuts but its the law of attraction, I caught myself thinking "3 leaf" as i sifted through them, and i realized that i was focusing all my energy thinking "3 leaf" , so i started thinking "4 leaf" and I swear I started pulling them suckers left and right,, Give it a try, the law of attraction is real, check out the book The Secret!!   Name: brandy reynolds • Friday, April 4, 2014  My boyfriend and I have a special clover patch in our friends yard that we tell no one about.the first time welooked we found seventeen. We found thirty yesterday and a five leaf clover too.I tape them in plastic clear tape and give them to friends and family.they put smiles on peoples faces .especially if they have never seen one before.   Name: Debbie Hoffman • Thursday, July 10, 2014  I'm also one of those people that can look down and there are 4 and 5 leaf clovers for my picking. I have to literally try to ignore the patches of clover so I don't find any. Getting out of my car today I found (21) 4 leaf clovers and (4)5 leaf clovers in just a few minutes. I had to walk away. I'm running out of books to press them in, however it is so much fun I can't stop!   Name: Tom • Tuesday, September 9, 2014  I know its an old article but I thought I'd chime in. From the way it was explained to me, the extra leaves on the clovers are actually the clover equivalent of twins/triplets. Since a patch that produces a four leaf clover already has the right genes, it's actually more probable that if you find one, you'll find another in the same patch than another patch or especially the around same area if there are a lot of bees to pollinate them properly. I've found thousands over my lifetime and I usually find them in groups. The largest group I've found was 31 within about 10 square feet.

Jim Frost  25 July, 2013                                   Picture of four-leaf clover by Joe Papp.  This may seem to be an odd time to write about four-leaf clovers, the traditional Irish lucky charms. However, clovers are currently growing full-force in my yard!  I was out doing yard work when I noticed patches of clovers. I blame my neighbor for them because, while I have patches of clover in my grass, he has patches of grass in his clover filled yard! The clovers got me thinking about Carly Barry’s post about the odds of finding four-leaf clovers. It also prompted some fun, backyard science with my daughter!  In Carly’s blog, reader comments raise a number of questions. If four-leaf clovers are so rare, how is it possible for some people to find so many? Some readers report that they regularly find four-leaf clovers. Others claim that it only takes minutes to find one, or even half a dozen! Maybe they are luckier, or perhaps there are some factors that affect their chances of finding four-leaf clovers?  One of the most important things we do in statistics is to identify the factors that affect an outcome. In this blog, I explore how it’s possible to find so many four-leaf clovers despite the low odds.  White Clovers a.k.a Trifolium Repens  Tradition holds that you are lucky if you find a white clover that has four leaves. These clovers are named after their white flowers. In their scientific name, Trifolium means three-leafed, the usual number for this species. There are other types of clovers that typically have four leaves, so watch out for imposters!  It’s widely cited that one out of every 10,000 white clovers has four-leaves. I was surprised to learn that there are even five-leaf clovers, and more! The Guinness world record for the most leaves on a clover is 56!  How Much Area Do You Need to Find a Four-Leaf Clover?  If the odds of finding a four-leaf clover are truly 1-in-10,000, how much area do you need for 10,000 clovers? I really had no idea if it was the size of a field, or a typical backyard. This point is where my 8 year-old daughter and I had some good, hands-on science fun in our backyard while learning about estimating.  As you can see in the picture, we measured out a six-inch square and laid it over a patch of fairly dense clovers. As we picked the clovers on the top layer, we noticed there was another layer of clovers below it, and another one below that. After we picked all of the clovers out of the square, we counted them.  That quarter of a square foot patch had about 200 clovers. Doing some simple math, we estimated that there are 800 clovers per square foot and 10,000 clovers can grow in just 12.5 square feet (1.2 m 2 ). For the 1-in-100,000 five-leaf clovers, you’d need 125 square feet (11.6 m 2 ).  We both thought it was going to be a much larger area, which would make finding them more difficult. However, you don’t need to scour an entire field to find a four-leaf clover. Instead, you can expect to find 10,000 clovers in a 3’ X 4’ area. That helps to explain the ease that some have of finding them!  The Probability of Finding Four-Leaf Clovers  According to probability theory, the probability of an event happening is determined in part by the type of event. In this case, I need to determine whether finding four-leaf clovers are either independent or dependent events .  An event is independent if the occurrence of the event doesn’t affect the probability of the event happening again. If you flip a coin and get a heads, you still have a 50/50 chance of getting a heads on the next coin toss.  An event is dependent if the occurrence of the event affects the probability of the event happening again. If you randomly draw a King from a deck of cards and don’t replace it, the probability of drawing a King the next time has decreased.  In terms of four-leaf clovers, if you find one four-leaf clover, does the probability of the next clover being a four-leaf clover stay the same (independent) or change (dependent)?  Researchers at the University of Georgia have discovered a gene that allows clover plants to grow a fourth leaf. Clover with this gene typically grow three leaves. However, given the correct environmental conditions (soil pH, temperature and pollution), they can sprout a fourth leaf.  Genes are inheritable. Consequently, plants in close proximity are more likely to share genes than more distant plants. Similarly, environmental conditions are more likely to be similar for plants close together. Collectively, these facts suggest that finding multiple four-leaf clovers are dependent events. If you find one, your odds of finding another one in the same area increase!  This supports the notion I found on websites that four-leaf clovers are often in hot spots, as well as the comments in Carly’s blog that mention finding four-leaf clovers in rapid succession! You can also revisit hot spots to increase your odds of finding them more quickly.  How to Find Four-Leaf Clovers    This 6' X 8' section of my neighbor's yard probably has 40,000 clovers!  Finally, let's look into the process of finding four-leaf clovers that is recommended by those who are proficient at finding them. I want to see whether this sheds any more light on how some people can find them so easily!  Websites about how to find four-leaf clovers state that you should not examine individual clovers. Instead, these sites stress that you should stand and sweep your eyes over the entire patch while you brush the clovers with your foot to ensure that you see all of the layers. The process emphasizes speed because you keep your eyes moving and the abnormal clover should stick out like a sore thumb. So, it won’t take long to look over that 3’ X 4’ patch of clover!  This process reminds me of visual inspections done by quality control specialists. These inspectors are highly trained in both subject area knowledge and the proper methods to pick out any abnormalities. Some studies have shown that the more accurate visual inspectors had fewer “eye fixations” (e.g. they keep their eyes moving), just like the four-leaf clover websites suggest!  I suspect that those who find four-leaf clovers quickly and easily have developed a skill set that is similar to trained visual inspectors. In a production process, a manufacturer doesn’t just hope that the inspectors find defects by chance, instead they develop the skills necessary for the product line.  Similarly, collectors of four-leaf clovers hone their skills to overcome the long odds of finding them by chance alone.  The Keys to Finding Many Lucky Clovers Quickly and Easily!  While exploring how some people find four-leaf clovers so easily, I found three important factors that affect the chances of finding them.  Two of these factors you can improve to your advantage. You can:   Develop and improve skills to find four-leaf clovers  Build a knowledge-base of locations that are more likely to have four-leaf clovers   While you can’t control the density of clovers, it turns out that you don’t have to look over a large area to observe 10,000 clovers.

[VIDEO] DJ Digital March 17, 2016 Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Superstition says that the four-leaf clover is thought to bring good luck to anyone who finds one, especially if found by chance. The leaves on the four-leaf clover are said to stand for faith, hope, love and luck—but that hasn't always been the case. The patron saint of Ireland (known to most as St. Patrick) used the shamrock to explain the Holy Trinity—the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. So what did the fourth leaf stand for? St. Patrick claimed that the fourth leaf meant the Grace of God, and the shamrock's allure dates as far back as Adam and Eve. If you remember correctly, the story goes that Eve took a four-leaf clover from the Garden of Eden to remind her of paradise. Express, Getty Images So we know they are unique, and we know they are rare, but just what are the odds of stumbling across a four-leaf clover in the wild? Well, science says that we're looking at about a 1 and 10,000 chance of finding a four-leaf clover; and if you find one, it may mean a few things: 1. A person who finds one will meet a future lover on the same day.  2. The clover brings good luck and protects against evil.  3. Anyone wearing a clover will be able to see fairies if they are around.  4. If you pass your clover on to someone else, your luck will double. Have you ever found a four-leaf clover? Did you experience any of the above?

The term is also often used for the wood-sorrel  ( Oxalis acetosella ) and Oxalis tetraphylla , a common potted plant.  For the popular 20th-century song, see " I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover ". For the 2010 Diana Vickers song, see Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree .     Four-leaf white clover ( Trifolium repens )    The four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover . According to tradition, such clovers bring good luck , [1] though it is not clear when or how that tradition got started. The earliest mention of “Fower-leafed or purple grasse” is from 1640 and simply says that it was kept in gardens because it was “good for the purples in children or others” [2] . A description from 1869 says that four-leaf clovers were “gathered at night-time during the full moon by sorceresses, who mixed it with Vervain and other ingredients, while young girls in search of a token of perfect happiness made quest of the plant by day” [3] . The first reference to luck might be from an 11-year-old girl, who wrote in an 1877 letter to St. Nicholas Magazine , “Did the fairies ever whisper in your ear, that a four-leaf clover brought good luck to the finder?” [4]     Contents    1  Occurrence  2  Cause  3  Multi-leaved cultivars  4  Other species  5  Symbolic usage  6  Meanings  7  References  8  External links     Occurrence [ edit ]  It is claimed that there are approximately 10,000 three-leaf clovers for every four-leaf clover. [5] However, an actual survey of over 5 million clovers found the real frequency to be closer to 1 in 5000. [6]  Even so, this probability has not deterred collectors who have reached records as high as 160,000 four-leaf clovers in a lifetime. However, the world record for four-leaf clovers in a single day is 72, and the record for one hour is 51, set by an American named Griffin McDowell on August 12, 2013. [7]  Clovers can have more than four leaves. Five-leaf clovers are less commonly found naturally than four-leaf clovers; [8] [9] however, they, too, have been successfully cultivated. [10] Some four-leaf clover collectors, particularly in Ireland, regard the five-leaf clover, known as a rose clover, as a particular prize. [11] In exceptionally rare cases, clovers are able to grow with six leaves and more in nature. [12] The most leaves ever found on a single clover stem ( Trifolium repens L .) is 56 and was discovered by Shigeo Obara of Hanamaki City, Iwate, Japan, on 10 May 2009. [13] [14]  Cause [ edit ]     A four-leaf clover    It is debated whether the fourth leaf is caused genetically or environmentally. Its relative rarity (1 in 5000 clovers [6] ) suggests a possible recessive gene appearing at a low frequency. Alternatively, four-leaf clovers could be caused by somatic mutation or a developmental error of environmental causes. They could also be caused by the interaction of several genes that happen to segregate in the individual plant. It is possible all four explanations could apply to individual cases. This means that multiple four-leaf clovers could be found in the same clover plant. [15]  Researchers from the University of Georgia have reported finding the gene that turns ordinary three-leaf clovers into the coveted four-leaf types. Masked by the three-leaf gene and strongly influenced by environmental condition, molecular markers now make it possible to detect the presence of the gene for four-leaves and for breeders to work with it. The results of the study, which also located two other leaf traits in the white-clover genome, were reported in the July/August 2010 edition of Crop Science , published by the Crop Science Society of America. [16]  The other leaf traits, the red fleck mark and red midrib, a herringbone pattern that runs down the center of each leaflet in a bold red color, were mapped to nearby locations, resolving a century-old question as to whether these leaf traits were controlled by one gene or two separate genes.  White clover has many genes that affect leaf color and shape, and the three in the study were very rare. These traits can be quite attractive, particularly if combined with others, and can turn clover into an ornamental plant for use in flower beds [17]  There are reports of farms in the US which specialize in four-leaf clovers, producing as many as 10,000 a day (to be sealed in plastic as "lucky charms") by introducing a genetically engineered ingredient to the plants to encourage the aberration (there are, however, widely available cultivars that regularly produce leaves with multiple leaflets – see below). [18] These are associated to Saint Patricks Day.  Multi-leaved cultivars [ edit ]     Example of a five-leaf clover    There are some cultivars of white clover ( Trifolium repens ) which regularly produce more than three leaflets, including purple-leaved T. repens "Purpurascens Quadrifolium" and green-leaved T. repens "Quadrifolium". [19]  Trifolium repens "Good Luck" is a cultivar which has three, four, or five green, dark-centered leaflets per leaf. [20]  Other species [ edit ]  Other plants may be mistaken for, or misleadingly sold as, "four-leaf clovers"; for example, Oxalis tetraphylla is a species of wood sorrel with leaves resembling a four-leaf clover. [21] [22] Other species that have been sold as "four-leaf clovers" include Marsilea quadrifolia . [23] [24]  Symbolic usage [ edit ]          The Centre parties in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Åland, Estonia, Poland and Lithuania have similar backgrounds and identities, as indicated by their similar logos, based on the four-leaf clover          This section is in a list format that may be better presented using prose .  You can help by converting this section to prose, if appropriate . Editing help is available.  (March 2016)      Italian automobile maker Alfa Romeo used to paint a four-leaf clover, or quadrifoglio, on the side of their racing cars. This tradition started in the 1923 Targa Florio race, when driver Ugo Sivocci decorated his car with a green clover on a white background.  Los Angeles-based space exploration company SpaceX includes a four-leaf clover on each space mission embroidered patch as a good luck charm. Inclusion of the clover has become a regular icon on SpaceX's flight patches ever since the company's first successful Falcon 1 rocket launch in 2008, which was the first mission to feature a clover "for luck" on its patch. [25]  Celtic Football Club , an association football team from Glasgow, Scotland , have used the four leaf clover as the club's official badge for over 40 years.  Former Japanese game developer studio Clover Studio used a four-leaf clover as their logo.  Several businesses and organisations use a four-leaf clover in their logos to signify Celtic origins. [26] [27] [28]  The global network of youth organizations 4-H uses a green four-leaf clover with a white H on each leaf. [29]  The logo of the New Jersey Lottery features an outline of the state in white on a green four-leaf clover printed on a lottery draw machine ball.   Meanings [ edit ]  Some folk traditions assign a different attribute to each leaf of a clover. The first leaf represents hope, the second stands for faith, the third is for love and the fourth leaf brings luck to the finder. A fifth leaf represents money, but there is no meaning as yet for the sixth leaf and above. [12] Some reports claim six to be fame and seven to be longevity, though the notions' origination is unknown.  References [ edit ]    ^  Harry Oliver (2010).

Due to their rarity, they can also be a fun souvenir to have. To find a four-leaf clover, find some clover patches in your area and scan them for a four-leaf clover. Be patient and keep looking, as four-leaf clovers are rare. If you don't find one the first time you go out hunting, keep your eyes peeled in the future. With some dedication, you should eventually find a four-leaf clover of your own.         Steps    Method  1   Locating Clover Patches           1   Do an online search for clovers in your area. If you're not sure where to find clovers in your area, do an online search for "clover patches" followed by the name of your town. You may find sites with an overview of the types of foliage in the different areas of your town. Users may also leave comments about local parks or trials on sites like Yelp, letting other people know the kinds of plants they found there.          2   Walk around local areas with a lot of foliage. If you can't find clovers online, do your own search. Walk around areas with a lot of leaves and trees, like parks and trials, to seek out clover patches. [1]   If you have a backyard, look there as well. Clovers often grow in lawns.           3   Check shady, dry areas. Clovers tend to thrive in soil that does not drain well. They also frequently grow in the shade. When out looking for clovers, check shady and dry areas for a clover patch. [2]          4   Identify a clover patch. Clover patches are comprised of plants with small green flowers circling a center point. Watch out for plants that look similar to clovers. Plants with purple circles at the center are not clovers. Also, if you see a whole patch of what look like four-leaf clovers, these are not clovers. [3] Remember, four-leaf clovers are rare. There is one four-leaf clover for every 10,000 three-leaf clover in a patch. [4]                Method  2   Searching for a Four-Leaf Clover          1   Scan the patch carefully. Do not try to look at every clover individually, as this will take far too long. Instead, stand above the patch and scan it closely. Pause if a clover jumps out at you and check to see if it has four leaves. [5]          2   Skim the surface with your hands. If scanning from a distance isn't working, crouch near the clover patch. Run your hands over the clover patch slowly. Focus in on the clovers as they pass through your fingers, checking for clovers with extra leaves. [6]          3   Push the leaves apart if you think you see a four-leaf clover. If you see what appears to be a four-leaf clover, push away the clovers surrounding it. See if it actually has four leaves. Clovers sometimes look like they have four leaves, but you're really seeing leaves from another clover clustering near it. [7]          4   Look in the same area if you find a four leaf clover. If you happen to find a four-leaf clover, keep looking in that area. Four-leaf clovers are caused by a genetic mutation. Therefore, they tend to be found close together as the seeds will spread around the same area. You may be lucky enough to find a second four-leaf clover. [8]           Method  3   Avoiding Common Mistakes          1   Don't try to look at every individual clover. Scanning the leaves works better than examining every leaf. As there are hundreds of clovers in a single patch, you won't have time to look at them all. If you scan the leaves instead, a difference in the general pattern may jump out at you. [9]          2   Look for smaller leaves on four-leaf clovers. Don't expect a four-leaf clover to have completely even leaves. Keep in mind, when scanning for a four-leaf clover, the clover's fourth leaf may be significantly smaller than the others. [10]          3   Don't get discouraged. Four-leaf clovers are incredibly rare. The more often you search, the more likely you are to find one. If you don't find a four-leaf clover on your first search, keep an eye out each time you pass a clover patch. The more often you look, the more likely you are to eventually find a four-leaf clover.

Thanks!   Yes  No    Not Helpful 17  Helpful 104           I think that the best time to find a four leaf clover is when it is raining or soggy outside and it is really cool.    wikiHow Contributor   You might be right, for that might be your lucky time. Perhaps you have a reason you might share with us as to why this time works best for you - maybe the extra leaf causes the plant to show itself differently in the rain, perhaps it sags more?   Thanks!   Yes  No    Not Helpful 19  Helpful 73           Why don't they grow well in flowerbeds?    wikiHow Contributor   When another plant is already taking up the soil nutrients, space and light, other plants find it hard to compete. If the flowerbed is well tended, all weed plants (including clover) will also be frequently removed. However, a flowerbed that is sparse and poorly cared for might allow clover to grow.   Thanks!   Yes  No    Not Helpful 17  Helpful 57           Can you still have the luck when you weren't the one who found the cloverleaf?    wikiHow Contributor   This will depend on the person who did find it. If they give it to you with a good heart and the intention to pass on the luck, there is surely no reason why that luck won't rub off onto you. If they give it to you with indifference or even malice though, it might not work.   Thanks!
