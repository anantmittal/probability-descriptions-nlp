Two things: * the GMAT will *never* ask questions about standard decks of cards, since people who play bridge or poker would have a substantial (and unfair) advantage over people who do not; * the GMAT will *never* use notation like '52C2' in an answer choice. That's not even a standard notation in general mathematics; it's more a convenient shorthand to use in internet forums. GMAT answer choices will always be written either as numbers, or using factorials So that makes me wonder what the source is for these questions, and whether it contains a lot of other irrelevant material. In any case, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck. We need our first card to be one of these 8; there is an 8/52 probability our first card is from this group. Then when we pick the second card, we will be picking from 51 cards in total, and there will be 4 left which are of the type we need (if we picked a King first, we need one of the four Queens and vice versa), so there is a 4/51 probability the second card is the right type, and the answer is (8/52)(4/51). That is equal to answer choice B, though you'd never see anything that looks like answer choice B on the GMAT. It's a bit absurd to write '4C1' in that answer choice anyway, since '4C1' is just equal to 4. _________________  GMAT Tutor in Toronto If you are looking for online GMAT math tutoring, or if you are interested in buying my advanced Quant books and problem sets, please contact me at ianstewartgmat at gmail.com                         amit2k9      VP           Status: There is always something new !!

Two things: * the GMAT will *never* ask questions about standard decks of cards, since people who play bridge or poker would have a substantial (and unfair) advantage over people who do not; * the GMAT will *never* use notation like '52C2' in an answer choice. That's not even a standard notation in general mathematics; it's more a convenient shorthand to use in internet forums. GMAT answer choices will always be written either as numbers, or using factorials So that makes me wonder what the source is for these questions, and whether it contains a lot of other irrelevant material. In any case, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck. We need our first card to be one of these 8; there is an 8/52 probability our first card is from this group. Then when we pick the second card, we will be picking from 51 cards in total, and there will be 4 left which are of the type we need (if we picked a King first, we need one of the four Queens and vice versa), so there is a 4/51 probability the second card is the right type, and the answer is (8/52)(4/51). That is equal to answer choice B, though you'd never see anything that looks like answer choice B on the GMAT. It's a bit absurd to write '4C1' in that answer choice anyway, since '4C1' is just equal to 4. _________________  GMAT Tutor in Toronto If you are looking for online GMAT math tutoring, or if you are interested in buying my advanced Quant books and problem sets, please contact me at ianstewartgmat at gmail.com                         amit2k9      VP           Status: There is always something new !!

If the order of them did not matter, then the answer would be six times as large.  As a typesetting note, \times produces $\times$ or \cdot produces $\cdot$ for multiplication. – JMoravitz  Nov 6 '16 at 4:23         add a comment |               active  oldest  votes      Know someone who can answer?

Calculate the probability of getting (i) A king or a queen (ii) Neither a heart nor a red king.     One card is drawn from a well shuffled pack of 52 cards. Calculate the probability of getting (i) A king or a queen (ii) Neither a heart nor a red king      edit Answer    Like    Follow  Following       Asked by Adithyan  Mar 21     person        1 Answers     Top Recommend   |   Recent        person     Adithyan  Member since Aug 18 2014             person     Ramesh , SubjectMatterExpert  Member since Apr 01 2014       (i) a king or a queen Total number of king is 4 out of 52 cards.  Total number of queen is 4 out of 52 cards  Number of favourable outcomes i.e. ‘a king or a queen’ is 4 + 4 = 8 out of 52 cards.  Therefore, probability of getting ‘a king or a queen’  P(E) = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 8/52 = 2/13  (ii) Number of hearts = 13  Total number of non-hearts out of 52 cards = 52 - 13 = 39  Therefore, spades, clubs and diamonds are the 39 cards.  Cards of hearts and diamonds are red cards.  Number of red kings in red cards = 2  Therefore, neither a heart nor a red king = 39 - 1 = 38  [1 red king is already included in the 13 hearts so, we take number of red kings as 1]  Therefore, probability of getting ‘neither a heart nor a red king’  = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 38/52 = 19/26          SME Approved      Recommend(0)      Comment (0)                 Add Comment   Done       Please enter the comment.

Asked by: Madhu on Jan 28, 2016. 1 Answer   Bookmark Like  0 Dislike  0 ⚐ Report   Kokila said: (Thu, Jan 28, 2016 11:24:31 AM IST) Answer: Probability of getting a king, a queen, an ace is 0.002895. Solution: Let S be the Sample space. Let E Be the Event. An ordinary pack has 52 cards. In which 4 cards are king, 4 cards are queen and 4 cards are ace. The given question said  three cards are drawn at randomly. So, n(S) = 52C3 = 22100 Each card has 4 kings, 4 queens, 4 aces Let E1 be the event of a king draw from 4 kings => n(E1) = 4C1 = 4 Let E2 be the event of a queen draw from 4 queens => n(E2) = 4C1 = 4 Let E3 be the event of a ace draw from 4 aces => n(E3) = 4C1 = 4 n(E) = n(E1) * n(E2) * n(E3) => 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 Probability of getting a king, a queen, an ace: P(E) = n(E)/n(S) => 64/22100 = 0.002895.

Two things: * the GMAT will *never* ask questions about standard decks of cards, since people who play bridge or poker would have a substantial (and unfair) advantage over people who do not; * the GMAT will *never* use notation like '52C2' in an answer choice. That's not even a standard notation in general mathematics; it's more a convenient shorthand to use in internet forums. GMAT answer choices will always be written either as numbers, or using factorials So that makes me wonder what the source is for these questions, and whether it contains a lot of other irrelevant material. In any case, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck. We need our first card to be one of these 8; there is an 8/52 probability our first card is from this group. Then when we pick the second card, we will be picking from 51 cards in total, and there will be 4 left which are of the type we need (if we picked a King first, we need one of the four Queens and vice versa), so there is a 4/51 probability the second card is the right type, and the answer is (8/52)(4/51). That is equal to answer choice B, though you'd never see anything that looks like answer choice B on the GMAT. It's a bit absurd to write '4C1' in that answer choice anyway, since '4C1' is just equal to 4. _________________  GMAT Tutor in Toronto If you are looking for online GMAT math tutoring, or if you are interested in buying my advanced Quant books and problem sets, please contact me at ianstewartgmat at gmail.com                         amit2k9      VP           Status: There is always something new !!

Two things: * the GMAT will *never* ask questions about standard decks of cards, since people who play bridge or poker would have a substantial (and unfair) advantage over people who do not; * the GMAT will *never* use notation like '52C2' in an answer choice. That's not even a standard notation in general mathematics; it's more a convenient shorthand to use in internet forums. GMAT answer choices will always be written either as numbers, or using factorials So that makes me wonder what the source is for these questions, and whether it contains a lot of other irrelevant material. In any case, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck. We need our first card to be one of these 8; there is an 8/52 probability our first card is from this group. Then when we pick the second card, we will be picking from 51 cards in total, and there will be 4 left which are of the type we need (if we picked a King first, we need one of the four Queens and vice versa), so there is a 4/51 probability the second card is the right type, and the answer is (8/52)(4/51). That is equal to answer choice B, though you'd never see anything that looks like answer choice B on the GMAT. It's a bit absurd to write '4C1' in that answer choice anyway, since '4C1' is just equal to 4. _________________  GMAT Tutor in Toronto If you are looking for online GMAT math tutoring, or if you are interested in buying my advanced Quant books and problem sets, please contact me at ianstewartgmat at gmail.com                         amit2k9      VP           Status: There is always something new !!

Help is appreciated, thanks in advance.  52 cards in a deck of which 4 are jacks, 4 are queens, and 4 are kings.    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question     asked Nov 6 '16 at 4:22       chaosdig5   21 6              4      Yes, that is correct.  If the order of them did not matter, then the answer would be six times as large.  As a typesetting note, \times produces $\times$ or \cdot produces $\cdot$ for multiplication. – JMoravitz  Nov 6 '16 at 4:23         add a comment |               active  oldest  votes      Know someone who can answer?

Calculate the probability of getting (i) A king or a queen (ii) Neither a heart nor a red king.     One card is drawn from a well shuffled pack of 52 cards. Calculate the probability of getting (i) A king or a queen (ii) Neither a heart nor a red king      edit Answer    Like    Follow  Following       Asked by Adithyan  Mar 21     person        1 Answers     Top Recommend   |   Recent        person     Adithyan  Member since Aug 18 2014             person     Ramesh , SubjectMatterExpert  Member since Apr 01 2014       (i) a king or a queen Total number of king is 4 out of 52 cards.  Total number of queen is 4 out of 52 cards  Number of favourable outcomes i.e. ‘a king or a queen’ is 4 + 4 = 8 out of 52 cards.  Therefore, probability of getting ‘a king or a queen’  P(E) = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 8/52 = 2/13  (ii) Number of hearts = 13  Total number of non-hearts out of 52 cards = 52 - 13 = 39  Therefore, spades, clubs and diamonds are the 39 cards.  Cards of hearts and diamonds are red cards.  Number of red kings in red cards = 2  Therefore, neither a heart nor a red king = 39 - 1 = 38  [1 red king is already included in the 13 hearts so, we take number of red kings as 1]  Therefore, probability of getting ‘neither a heart nor a red king’  = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 38/52 = 19/26          SME Approved      Recommend(0)      Comment (0)                 Add Comment   Done       Please enter the comment.

Asked by: Madhu on Jan 28, 2016. 1 Answer   Bookmark Like  0 Dislike  0 ⚐ Report   Kokila said: (Thu, Jan 28, 2016 11:24:31 AM IST) Answer: Probability of getting a king, a queen, an ace is 0.002895. Solution: Let S be the Sample space. Let E Be the Event. An ordinary pack has 52 cards. In which 4 cards are king, 4 cards are queen and 4 cards are ace. The given question said  three cards are drawn at randomly. So, n(S) = 52C3 = 22100 Each card has 4 kings, 4 queens, 4 aces Let E1 be the event of a king draw from 4 kings => n(E1) = 4C1 = 4 Let E2 be the event of a queen draw from 4 queens => n(E2) = 4C1 = 4 Let E3 be the event of a ace draw from 4 aces => n(E3) = 4C1 = 4 n(E) = n(E1) * n(E2) * n(E3) => 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 Probability of getting a king, a queen, an ace: P(E) = n(E)/n(S) => 64/22100 = 0.002895.
