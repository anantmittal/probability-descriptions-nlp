The answer is 45/118, but I am unsure of how. Update : The book may have had the question worded incorrectly, because the answer stated is incorrect.  What i know : Each question has 3 selections, and the probability of getting one wrong is 2/3. I thought it would be as simple as the multiplicative rule, but there's more to it apparently. I think it has to do with a formula as you go along in the questions, but it states that each probability is equal, as a 1/3 chance.  Any suggestions?    probability     share | cite | improve this question      edited Jan 31 '13 at 2:02             asked Jan 31 '13 at 1:45       Ben Sewards   144 1 2 8                  You did not say how many questions are on the test! – André Nicolas  Jan 31 '13 at 1:46            haha it's 9pm here and i'm going through a book of hundreds of questions! – Ben Sewards  Jan 31 '13 at 1:55            @AndréNicolas 5 multiple-choice questions, right?

$$\binom{n}{k}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^k \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-k}.$$  And it is the Muliplication Rule. To make typing simpler, I will take $k=2$, $n=5$. Write $C$ for correct, $N$ for not correct.  By the Multiplication Rule, the probability of $CCNNN$ (first two right, next three wrong) is $(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$. But we can also get two right, three wrong in several other ways, like $CNCNN$, $CNNCN$, and so on. Each has probability $(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$.  How many such strings are there? We have to choose $2$ places from the $5$ available to put a $C$ into. There are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to do this, giving total probability $\binom{5}{2}(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$.  The same reasoning gives the general formula quoted above.  Remark: If there are only $5$ questions on the test, and we want the probability of answering all $5$ correctly, the probability is $(1/3)^5$, which is nowhere near the number quoted.  Because the formula for the probability has only $3$'s in the denominator, any probability we compute will have to be of shape $\frac{m}{3^e}$, where $m$ and $e$ are non-negative integers. The number $\frac{45}{118}$ is not of that shape, so cannot be the answer for the problem, or for any closely related problem.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 31 '13 at 2:11             answered Jan 31 '13 at 1:49       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  It is impossible to get $45/118$ as OP mentioned. – Patrick Li  Jan 31 '13 at 1:57            i have no idea why that was the answer in the book, investigation time -.- – Ben Sewards  Jan 31 '13 at 1:59             @BenSewards You still didn't say the total number of questions. – Patrick Li  Jan 31 '13 at 1:59            no total number of questions were of concern in the question. Maybe a total of 5? I got the same answer as above, so I guess I'll stick with that in the future when it is the case. – Ben Sewards  Jan 31 '13 at 2:01         add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      A simple bit of logic can quickly prove that 45/118 is incorrect. The chance of guessing one answer on its own is 1/3.  45/118 is slightly more than 1/3 which means that guessing all 5 correctly is more probable than guessing only one correctly. This is obviously untrue as guessing each additional answer is increasingly less likely.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 10 '17 at 13:49       WDB   11 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Each question has a true/false option.  1) TRUE or FALSE  2) TRUE or FALSE  3) TRUE or FALSE  4) TRUE or FALSE   What is the probability of you getting all four questions correct?  I am just curious behind the math, I have not taken a probabiltity course so I'm sure my answer is wrong:  I think that since there are two options per question, the chances of getting 1 question correct is $50/100$.

Thus, in total, there are $2^4 = 16$ ways to answer the four questions. \begin{array}{c c c c}
T & T & T & T\\
T & F & T & T\\
T & T & F & T\\

F & F & F & F
\end{array}  Only one of these $16$ sequences is correct.  Assuming each of these $16$ sequences is equally likely to occur (as would result from random guessing), the probability that all four questions are answered correctly is $1/16$.  If we assume that a person is equally likely to guess true or false on each question, then he or she has probability $1/2$ of answering each question correctly.  Under the assumption of independence , the probability that all four questions are answered correctly is 
$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}$$
We add probabilities of mutually exclusive events (events that cannot occur at the same time).  We multiply probabilities of independent events.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 25 '17 at 4:02             answered Jun 25 '17 at 3:51       N. F.

Since there are four questions, each has a 1/2 chance of getting the right answer. So to find it, you do (1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2). Therefore, for this case, there is a 1/16 chance of getting the right answer or (1/(2^4)) chance. Or a 6.25% chance.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 25 '17 at 3:29       Tom Himler   499 12                  Here is a tutorial on how to typeset mathematics on this site. – N.

With four possible answer to each problem, the probability of answering one correctly by choosing at random is 1/4 and the probability of answering incorrectly is 3/4.  So the probability of answering all 8 questions incorrectly (0 correctly) is $(3/4)^8= 0.31640625$.  The probability of answering a specific question correctly and the other seven incorrectly is $(1/4)(3/4)^7= 0.033370971679685$.  The probability any one of the seven is correct and the other 3 incorrect is that times 8, 0.2669677734375.  The probability that either all 8 are incorrect or one is correct and the other 7 are incorrect is 0.31640625+ 0.2669677734375= 0.5833740234375.

But it cannot be 0% either, because then the correct answer would be 25%. So none of the answers are correct, so the answer must be 0%. But then it is 25%. And so forth.  It's a multiple-choice variant (with bells and whistles) of the classical liar paradox , which asks whether the statement   This statement is false.   is true or false. There are various more or less contrived "philosophical" attempts to resolve it, but by far the most common resolution is to deny that the statement means anything in the first place; therefore it is also meaningless to ask for its truth value.   Edited much later to add: There's a variant of this puzzle that's very popular on the internet at the moment, in which answer option (c) is 60% rather than 0%. In this variant it is at least internally consistent to claim that all of the answers are wrong, and so the possibility of getting a right one by choosing randomly is 0%.  Whether this actually resolves the variant puzzle is more a matter of taste and temperament than an objective mathematical question. It is not in general true for self-referencing questions that simply being internally consistent is enough for an answer to be unambiguously right; otherwise the question   Is the correct answer to this question "yes"?   would have two different "right" answers, because "yes" and "no" are both internally consistent. In the 60% variant of the puzzle it is happens that the only internally consistent answer is "0%", but even so one might, as a matter of caution, still deny that such reasoning by elimination is valid for self-referential statements at all. If one adopts this stance, one would still consider the 60% variant meaningless.  One rationale for taking this strict position would be that we don't want to accept reasoning by elimination on   True or false?   The Great Pumpkin exists.  Both of these statements are false.    where the only internally consistent resolution is that the first statement is true and the second one is false. However, it appears to be unsound to conclude that the Great Pumpkin exists on the basis simply that the puzzle was posed.  On the other hand, it is difficult to argue that there is no possible principle that will cordon off the Great Pumpkin example as meaningless while still allowing the 60% variant to be meaningful.  In the end, though, these things are more matters of taste and philosophy than they are mathematics. In mathematics we generally prefer to play it safe and completely refuse to work with explicitly self-referential statements. This avoids the risk of paradox, and does not seem to hinder mathematical arguments about the things mathematicians are ordinarily interested in. So whatever one decides to do with the question-about-itself, what one does is not really mathematics.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 1 '11 at 16:12             answered Oct 27 '11 at 22:31       Henning Makholm   214k 14 276 500              16      Liar paradox is also known as the Epimenides paradox after Epimenides of Crete who claimed: "All Cretans are liars". – GEL  Oct 28 '11 at 1:39        6      Bertrand's paradox, the proof of the halting problem, and the proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem all rely on similar self-referencing statements. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Oct 28 '11 at 7:29        14      @BlueRaja, are you on first names with Bertrand Russell ? Usually, "Bertrand's paradox" is about failure to specify a distribution when saying "chose a random chord in a circle". An interesting distinction for Gödel's argument (and the halting problem, which is closely analogous) is that in Gödel's case the self-referential statement doesn't itself know it's being self-referential. It just happens to be. If we do some trivial rewriting on it (such as swapping two conjuncts somewhere) it still means the same but is not exactly self-referential. – Henning Makholm  Oct 28 '11 at 10:13        1      Henning, I agree that @BlueRaja's formulation is overly ambiguous, see this other Bertrand paradox . – Did  Oct 28 '11 at 13:27        66      How dare you question the existence of the Great Pumpkin!? – joriki  Nov 1 '11 at 15:30        |  show 2 more comments            up vote  77  down vote      The question is underspecified since it doesn't say which distribution is used in choosing an answer at random.

If I choose a. with probability 50% and b. with probability 50%, b is correct.  If I choose a. with probability 75% and b. with probability 25%, c is correct.

If 25 percent is the "right" answer, then you actually have two options.  If you have 2 options, then 50 percent is the statistical answer. And if since 50 percent is the only option place to mark down, that means that you will only get this answer right 25 percent of the time because you have a 1 in four chance.  It is impossible without a miracle. Plus, if it is impossible then does that leave the option of 0 open because then there are no right answers? That is saying: "If there are no right answers, this is the right answer." What are you really saying there? Nothing.  I think maybe you can't find out how many answers there are in the first place. There can't be only one. There can't be only two. There can't be three. There can't be four, and therefore one is the right answer? No. Because then you start back at the beginning.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 28 '11 at 0:20       Robert Sturgis   261 2 2              1      I haven't downvoted, but I believe it could be just because it doesn't add anything new to the previous answers. – Mark Hurd  Jan 16 '14 at 1:33        add a comment |             up vote  11  down vote      Well, I must be pretty insane if I start competing with these already heavily upvoted answers from high rep users. But although the following solution may sound a little creative or even frivolous, it could easily be the right one. You could say that this solution is reverse engineered , as follows:  The question instructs to only choose one single answer out of four. And assume a uniform distribution, since that is most likely intended, then each answer has a chance of 25% to become chosen.  So the correct answer should be: 25%.  This computes to answer A being correct, as well as answer D. Could that be? Yes, it can. The question does not reveal how many of the four given answers are correct, but since there is one to be picked, assume that at least one of the four answers is correct.  Let's call answer A + answer D the correct answer pair.  Now, there are two possible choices (A or D) that result in 50% of the correct answer (A and D). Secondly, there is 50% chance of picking one (A or D) of two (A and D) out of four (A to D). So whether answer A or answer D is chosen, in either case the probability of being correct (50% × 50%) is 25%, which evaluates true.  Thus, yes, the question has 2 correct answers.  And now I realize that this post is the long version of the by joriki ages ago given comment. ;)   Ok, to be clear about what I mean, I believe the question is a special variant of the following trick question:   What is the color of the car?   Black  Blue  Gray  Metallic    As owner of the car I know the correct answer is metallic black. But this would render the question unfair, because it is never possible to give this answer by only selecting one. The difference with the question in question is the equality of both answers to give, which makes it slightly more fair. But since you can select only half of the full solution, the probability is still 25%.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 28 '11 at 8:33             answered Oct 28 '11 at 2:20       NGLN   238 1 7              3      If I'm reading your response correctly, you're both giving meaning to the answers (answers A and D are possibly correct because they are both 25%), and ignoring this meaning (by assuming that one of A or D is the "correct" answer, as in on an answer key or in a computer).

Don't look if you want to solve it yourself.   a) can't be the answer because it says b) is correct, but the statement of b) directly contradicts the statement of a)  c) can't be correct, because it means a) and b) are correct but they contradict each other  d) can't be correct.  If it were, it would imply a) or b) or c) to be correct.  The only possibility left is b), since I have already ruled out a) and c).  But, b) contradicts d).  b) can’t be correct for the same reason, basically.  If it were true, since a) and c) can’t be true, this would imply d) is correct.  But b) contradicts d).  f) can't be correct.  If it were, it would imply that e) is also correct, which would contradict the statement of f).  This leaves only e) and none of the statements contradict e) so e) must be the correct answer.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 28 '11 at 21:04             answered Oct 28 '11 at 20:21       Graphth   9,253 2 28 66                  So, what's wrong with a similar question that actually has a solution?

Submitted by david on Mon, 31/10/2011 - 8:49am   I recently tweeted a link to this problem drawn on a blackboard , which got a lot of retweets.  Multiple Choice: If you choose an answer to this question at random, what is the chance you will be correct? A) 25% B) 50% C) 60% D) 25%  This is a fun question whose paradoxical, self-referential nature quickly reveals itself – A) seems to be fine until one realizes the D) option is also 25%.  A quick search reveals hundreds of discussion contributions of this problem, for example here and here and from a year ago. People often appear very confident that their answer is the only possible solution.  I am no logician and so unqualified to place this within the grand structures of mathematical paradoxes. I have not waded through all the discussions and so there may be something I have missed, but in among all the arguments there seem to be four conclusions that could be considered as 'correct'. These are my personal comments:  1) There can be no solution, since the ambiguity of ‘correct’ makes the question ill-posed. It's true the question is ambiguous, but this still seems a bit of a cop-out.  2) There is no solution.  This seems to take this interpretation of the question.  Which answer (or set of answers) of “p%”, is such that the statement ‘the probability of picking such an answer is p%’ is true?  Then this appears to be a well-posed question, but there is no solution.  3)  0%.  Consider a different interpretation of the question.  Is there a p%, such that the statement ‘the probability of picking an answer “p%” is p%’ is true?  Then this appears a well-posed question and has the solution p = 0, even though this is not one of the answers.  Of course if answer C) were changed to “0%” (as it is in this 2007 version of the question ), then this would also have no solution.  4) We can produce any answer we want by changing the probability distribution for the choice.  Why should ‘random’ mean an equally likely chance of picking the 4 answers?   If we, say, assume the probabilities of choosing (A) (B) (C) (D) to be (10%, 20%, 60%, 10%) then the answer to either formulation (2) and (3) is now “60%”.  But if we make the distribution (12.5%, 15%, 60%, 12.5%) then we seem to back to square one again, since there is now both a 25% chance of picking “25%”, and a 60% chance of picking “60%”.  I like conclusion 3) best, ie 0% .  Maybe the main lesson is: ambiguity and paradox are often the basis for a good joke.

I give my reasoning at http://djmarsay.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/uncertainty-puzzle/ . I also give a variant that would be a probability if you thought that everything that looked like a well-formed question was, and that all probabilties are numeric. I think that it is well-formed, so it must be an example of a non-numeric probability. But you may want to ask a logician.

Let me give you a simple example to help you understand your error.  Multiple Choice:  If you flip a fair coin, what is the probability of getting heads? A) 75% B) 25% C) 100% D) All of the above E) None of the above  The answer is E.  That's how multiple choice questions are answered.  If you write 50% below the answers on the test paper, you would be marked wrong.  Writing a number is a NOT a valid answer to a multiple choice question even if the question is "what is the probability".  If you still think that the answer to the paradox is 0%, then you have shown a basic failure in your ability to follow instructions.  Let me give you another example:  Multiple Choice:  What is 1+1? A) 22 B) 11 C) 0  What is the answer?  There is no correct answer!  Would this question make you start making up nonsense answers like you did in the Paradox question?  Or would you just admit the question is stupid and has no answer?  Why is it that people can't grasp that the paradox question simply has no valid answer?  What is it about the question that causes people keep making up nonsense answers and try to argue in support of the nonsense?  It's like me saying the answer to this last question is A), and giving the reason that it is because the teacher just accidently made a typo when typing up the question and obviously meant to type a single 2! The question as written is clear, and the question as written, simply has no valid answer.  End of story.  Nothing else to discuss.

It asks if you randomly choose, what are the chances YOU would be correct?  Well then I say it is up to me if the answer is right. So there for it is right 100% of the time.  Now then 100% is not one of the A B C D answers... But does it really tell me I have to pick from those 4?

The probability of getting it right is 33.33333% because there are actually three percentages, since there is twice the number 25, so it's one out of three to get it right. That is my humble opinion.    Log in or register to post comments              Blitz   Sun, 13/05/2012 - 6:14pm   Permalink       Focus on the ?   I love this question because it had so many layers. First thought was of course, what they said in school. "If you don't know the answer, you have a one in four chance if you guess." But then you see the other 25%... OK now it's 50%... but wait now there is a is a 0%... but that's not one of the answers ether. Take the answers out, and answer THIS question.  Multiple Choice: If you choose an answer to this question at random, what is the chance you will be correct?    A  B  C  D  or what if the answers were A)Blue B)Yellow C)Red D)Blue  This answer implies that there is another question. But the question states "this question"  So if I choose Yellow, Red, or ether Blue, I'm right... What if the implied question was whats my favorite color?     Log in or register to post comments              garybird   Thu, 17/05/2012 - 3:49pm   Permalink       Zero   The question doesn't imply that any of the answers are necessarily correct. So in that sense the actual answer to the question isn't tied to the multiple choice options. An equivalent question would be:
What are the chances of answering this question "what is the capital of Spain" correct.
A) Paris B) London C) Tokyo D) Wellington. 
You would have a zero percent chance of answering the question correctly. Every option in the probability example is also wrong, therefore the answer is zero percent chance of answering correctly.

How many answers are right from a set of four possible answers? It is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4.  You also always have an answer to the question : 2. What is the probability of randomly picking the right answer from a set of four alternatives, given a fixed number of right answers? It is either 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%.  In this case they’re sort of asking you both questions simultaneously, since the content of the possible answers should be fixing and allowing you to discover both a. the number of right answers and b. the right answer  Once you give an answer to either 1 or 2 you immediately get an answer to the other. In this case none of those answers is actually fixed, you should discover both at the same time: hence the (apparent) problem. The trouble is that there are very there are some (actually very strict) constrains regarding the possible relation between a and b that are not being respected by the given possible answers: hence the incoherence. Notice that for someone to be able to pick an answer correctly the following conditions must be met: I)	There is one correct answer ←→ There is one and only one option = 25% II)	There are two correct answers ←→ There should be two and only two options = 50% III)	There are three correct answers ←→ There should be three and only three options = 75% IV)	There are four correct answers ←→ There should be four and only four options = 100% once you don’t respect this conditions you have an incompatibility between picking the right answer and picking the number of right answers, and so there is no way to answer the question and you should not be bogged by the appearance that there should be such an answer.

BUT i think it should be 50 %.......
cause answer -A and -D can't be occur , it doesn't make sense .
BECAUSE , if you choose A , D also will be correct !!! , so the probability would be 50 % , , but the answer of A , D is 25 % , which means answer A , D will never be correct. !!!!!
so the options which works will only be B and C , so it s only 1/2 chance to get the correct answer ....
i am not sure , please suggest !!!!!    Log in or register to post comments              hole34   Sun, 01/06/2014 - 10:28am   Permalink       The answer  -----------------   The answer  -------------------                   ditch diggers     ------------------- -50%-

After coming up with a thousand different answers I jumped on here and saw I'd missed the point entirely. I looked at it like this:  The question says "If you pick an answer to this question at random..." I think that's loaded with implications...  It never says I have to choose an answer from the ones provided, just that I have to provide "an answer at random". It's not a 1 in 4 probability because I can give any answer I choose. "purple monkey dishwasher" is a valid answer. 17 is a valid answer. The question doesn't limit me to the four choices provided.  Pus, there are no values (numeric or otherwise) provided in the question. How is the answer calculated? Someone above asked "what if the question is 'what is the capital of Spain?'" Well then, there is an answer and only one correct answer. But what if the question was "what's your opinion of toasted cheese sandwiches?" What I mean is who decides whether the answer I provide is correct or not if there are no ways of calculating the answer in the first place? That implies to me that the answer is subject to evaluation and gradation by the person asking the question. I guess that would mean I can be anywhere from completely incorrect (zero%) or completely correct (100%). It's "correctness" is not a cold-hard right or wrong.  Finally, I thought "how can I know my chances of picking a correct answer if I don't know the question?". No question is provided. To which my friend replied "it IS the question". again, the wording is ambiguous. "If you provide an answer to THIS question". That means the question is self-referential. Wouldn't that mean it becomes an infinite regression, a logic-loop?  In the end I jumped online to find "the answer" only to discover I have missed the point entirely. I guess that's why my education ended in high school :) It's comforting to know that the university-educated aren't having much more luck than I am.  Oh, and I also felt that the question was attempting to be confusing by providing percentages as the answers. I started thinking it would be best to substitute the values provided with symbols ie:  A) 25% (substitute "orange") B) 50% ("apple") C) 60% ("banana") D) 25% ("orange")  as long as you still have 3 different answers out of four possible choices it removes the confusion but still leaves the same probability of getting the "right" answer; assuming you are approaching it as a probability question.

SEARCH  HOME       Math Central Quandaries & Queries          Question from Carla, a student:  You are taking a multiple choice quiz  that consist in 3 questions, each question has 3 possible answers only one is correct. To complete the quiz you randomly guess the answer to each question. Find the probability of guessing  exactly 2 answer correctly. b) at least to answer correctly . c)less than two answer correctly       Hi Carla.  If there were just one question, then the probability of guessing correctly would be 1/3.  Since all the answers are independent (the answer to one question has no bearing on the answers to the others), then this is the case with each question, so the chances of guessing all answers correctly is 1/3 × 1/3 × 1/3 = 1/27. Independent choices are linked by multiplication .  To have exactly 2 answers correct, we have to think of which one is wrong: there are 3 questions and any single one could be wrong. The probability that the first question is wrong is 2/3. And we know that the probabilities of the other two being right is 1/3 each, so the probability of just the first question being wrong and the others right is 2/3 × 1/3 × 1/3 = 2/27. But this is just one of the three cases: 1/3 × 2/3 × 1/3 and 1/3 × 1/3 × 2/3 also both equal 2/27 each. So here we add the cases together: 2/27 + 2/27 + 2/27 = 6/27 = 2/9. So the answer to part (a) of your question is 2/9.  To solve (b) Consider that (b) is the same as (a) with "all answers right" added in. So you can simply add answer (a) to the chance of guessing all answers correctly.  To solve (c) it might help you to think of the equivalent problem: what is the probability of getting 0 correct plus the probability of getting 1 correct?

A) 24/256 B) 53/512 C) 105/512 D) 459/512 E) 47/256 The probability of getting correct (C) answer is 1/4 and the the probability of getting wrong (W) answer is 3/4. We need to find the probability of getting at 3, 4 or 5 correct answers: The probability of getting 3 correct answers out of 5 is \(\frac{5!}{3!2!}*(\frac{1}{4})^3*(\frac{3}{4})^2\), we are multiplying by \(\frac{5!}{3!2!}\) since CCCWW scenario can occur in several ways: CCCWW, WWCCC, CWCWC, ... basically the number of permutations of 5 letters CCCWW, out of which 3 C's and 2 W's are identical (\(\frac{5!}{3!2!}\)); The probability of getting 4 correct answers out of 5 is \(\frac{5!}{4!}*(\frac{1}{4})^4*(\frac{3}{4})\); The probability of getting 5 correct answers out of 5 is simply \((\frac{1}{4})^5\). The overall probabity will be the sum of the above probabilities: \(\frac{5!}{3!2!}*(\frac{1}{4})^3*(\frac{3}{4})^2+\frac{5!}{4!}*(\frac{1}{4})^4*(\frac{3}{4})+(\frac{1}{4})^5=\frac{53}{512}\).

A) 24/256 B) 53/512 C) 105/512 D) 459/512 E) 47/256 We can compute either the probability of answering 3, 4, or 5 questions correctly, or subtract from 1 the probability of answering 0, 1, or 2 questions. The probability of answering any question correctly is 1/4, and obviously, answering incorrectly is 3/4. P(3 correct answers) =\(\frac{5*4}{2}(\frac{1}{4})^3(\frac{3}{4})^2=\frac{90}{4^5}\) P(4 correct answers) =\(5(\frac{1}{4})^4(\frac{3}{4})=\frac{15}{4^5}\) P(5 correct answers) =\((\frac{1}{4})^5=\frac{1}{4^5}\) The sum of the above probabilities gives \(\frac{106}{4^5}=\frac{53}{512}\). Answer B Relevant topic for this question - Binomial probability distribution Being a straightforward technical question, I question its importance for a real test. _________________  PhD in Applied Mathematics Love GMAT Quant questions and running.                           mayankdangi      Intern           Joined: 15 Apr 2012   Posts: 8                      Re: In a multiple choice test comprising 5 Questions, each with [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     07 Aug 2012, 08:16      Here is my approach- Probability for choosing correct answer is 1/4 and incorrect answer is 3/4 For 3 correct answers, C(5,3)*(1/4)^3*(3/4)^2=90/(4^5) For 4 correct answers, C(5,4)*(1/4)^4*(3/4)^1=15/(4^5) For 5 correct answers, C(5,5)*(1/4)^5*(3/4)^0=1/(4^5) So total probability =106/1024 =53/512 Ans B                        mvictor      Board of Directors     P     Joined: 17 Jul 2014   Posts: 2735   Location: United States (IL)   Concentration: Finance, Economics   Schools:  Stanford '20 (WD)    GMAT 1 : 650 Q49 V30     GPA: 3.92   WE: General Management (Transportation)                         Re: In a multiple choice test comprising 5 Questions, each with [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     18 Mar 2016, 19:59       SOURH7WK wrote: In a multiple choice test comprising 5 Questions, each with 4 choices, what is the probability of a student getting 3 or more questions correct?

Note that conceptually the question is fine for GMAT but the calculations  involved make it unsuitable. You can use approximation but I don't think GMAT will give you such a question.

We also don't know the exact number of questions. Not sufficient. Using both together, P(Answering all questions correctly) \(= (0.9)^n\) We know that n is up to 9. Now check using approximation: \((.9)^ = .81\) \((.9)^3 = (.9)*(.8) = .72\) \((.9)^4 = (.9) * (.9)^3 = (.9)*(.7) = .63\) (Ignore 2 of the .72 and use only .7) \((.9)^5 = (.9)*(.6) = .54\) \((.9)^6 = (.9)*(.5) = .45\) Note that using approximation, \((.9)^6\) came out to be less than 50%. The powers of 9 will not deplete as fast as we have approximated since we only took the first digit after decimal. But we do get the idea that soon enough powers of .9 will go below 50%. Perhaps it will go less than 50% on the 7th power. So depending on the number of questions, the probability of answering all questions correctly can be more than 50% or less than 50%.

(1) For each question on the chemistry exam, Patty has a 90% chance of answering the question correctly. (2) There are fewer than 10 questions on Patty's chemistry exam. Opt1). Probability the she answers correctly, P(C) = 0.9 therefore, probability for wrong answer, P(W) = 0.1 if number of questions on the test is 2, then P(C) = (0.9)^2 = 0.81 --------------------------------------------3------------- = (0.9)^3 = 0.729 examine the pattern , Probability of getting correct answers will reduce with the increase in number of questions since no information about the number of questions is provided, this option is not sufficient. Opt.2) there are fewer than 10 questions. This is still not sufficient as no information about the probability of correctly answering the question is provided. It can be 1, 0.5, 0.9 or anything. Not sufficient. opt1 & opt2 together are still not sufficient. if number of questions is 4 , P(getting all correct) = (0.9)^4 = ~0.64 this probability will decrease with the subsequent increase in the number of questions. Hence, both statements together are not sufficient. Answer.

(1) For each question on the chemistry exam, Patty has a 90% chance of answering the question correctly. (2) There are fewer than 10 questions on Patty's chemistry exam. Let's phrase what we are looking for: Let's assume that all the questions are independent from each other, and that each question have an euqal chance to be solved by Patty - lets denote the chance to solve correctly with P. In addition, let's denote the number of questions in the test with N So, the question asks to find out if (p)^n>0.5. St1. - since 0.5 = 5/10, we can see that (9/10)^2 will be greater than 5/10 only for n=1. if n>1, the answer will be no. St.2 Based on the mentioned above this statment does not give us any new information. To conclude-> answer is E.                        shashankism      Director        P     Joined: 13 Mar 2017   Posts: 591   Location: India   Concentration: General Management, Entrepreneurship   GPA: 3.8   WE: Engineering (Energy and Utilities)                      Re: Is the probability that Patty will answer all of the questio [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     22 Aug 2017, 07:37       pkhats wrote: Is the probability that Patty will answer all of the questions on her chemistry exam correctly greater than 50%?

DS: probability that Patty will answer all of the questions on her chemistry exam correctly > 50% ? Statement 1: P(correct answer) = 0.9 NOT SUFFICIENT Statement 2: For <10 question probabilities can be P = (0.9)^9, 0.9^8......, 0.9^2, 0.9 Now 0.9 = 0.9 .9^2 = 0.81 .9^3 = 0.729 ~ 0.73 .9^4 ~ 0.73 * .9 = .657 .9^5 ~ .657*.9 = .5913 ~.59 .9^6 ~ .59 * .9 = .531 ~ .53 .9^7 = .53*.9 = .477 So, values above .5 and below .5 exists.

If there is a .8 probability of getting a wrong answer on any given question, why isn't there a .2 probability of getting a right answer?   Because the question ask for "at least". 0.2^4 will give you the probability of getting them all right, which is a possibility, but the possibility of getting "at least" one right is much higher than that.                           anonymousegmat      Senior Manager           Joined: 14 Jun 2007   Posts: 395                        [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     06 Aug 2007, 19:16       Robin in NC wrote: trancing wrote: I think it goes like this: prob (>= 1 correct) = 1 - prob (0 correct) = 1 - (0.8^4) = 1 - 256/625 = 369/625=0.59 Answer D Hope this helps.

What makes these problems a bit messy is that we're dealing with a 9-question test.  If this was about a single question, it's not too horrible.  But here, it's asking the probability of getting four questions right out of nine, so I've got a bit of an issue.  It doesn't tell me which four questions I got right or wrong!  I could answer the first four questions right, or questions 2/5/7/8, or questions 3/6/8/9...you get the idea.  There are a lot of different ways of doing that, and then for each of those questions, I have a 1 in 4 chance that I got it right.  How do we deal with both of those issues at the same time?    Thankfully, there's a formula for this.  :)  Because each question on the test is either right or wrong, we're dealing with something called a binomial experiment...and then there's a formula for binomial probabilities.    The probability of getting exactly k successes in n attempts is equal to:    P( k successes in n attempts) = n C k * (p k ) * (q n-k )    In this specific problem, I've got 9 attempts to get exactly 4 questions right.  So, can you figure out what n and k are from that?    - The big C is "n choose k," which you hopefully have covered in your class...and your calculator will do it for you.  - The little p is "the probability of success on a single attempt."  So, in this problem, what is my chance of getting a single question right?  And then we raise that to the k power.  - The little q is "the probability of failure on a single attempt."  In this problem, what is my chance of getting a single question wrong?  - The "n - k" in the exponent is something we should be able to figure out by now, because we know n and k.  "n - k" will tell us how many failures we'll get out of our n attempts.  (In this problem, how many questions will we get wrong on the test if we got exactly 4 right?)    Hope this helps!         4/10/2015 | Michael W.

The answer is 45/118, but I am unsure of how. Update : The book may have had the question worded incorrectly, because the answer stated is incorrect.  What i know : Each question has 3 selections, and the probability of getting one wrong is 2/3. I thought it would be as simple as the multiplicative rule, but there's more to it apparently. I think it has to do with a formula as you go along in the questions, but it states that each probability is equal, as a 1/3 chance.

$$\binom{n}{k}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^k \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-k}.$$  And it is the Muliplication Rule. To make typing simpler, I will take $k=2$, $n=5$. Write $C$ for correct, $N$ for not correct.  By the Multiplication Rule, the probability of $CCNNN$ (first two right, next three wrong) is $(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$. But we can also get two right, three wrong in several other ways, like $CNCNN$, $CNNCN$, and so on. Each has probability $(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$.  How many such strings are there? We have to choose $2$ places from the $5$ available to put a $C$ into. There are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to do this, giving total probability $\binom{5}{2}(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$.  The same reasoning gives the general formula quoted above.  Remark: If there are only $5$ questions on the test, and we want the probability of answering all $5$ correctly, the probability is $(1/3)^5$, which is nowhere near the number quoted.  Because the formula for the probability has only $3$'s in the denominator, any probability we compute will have to be of shape $\frac{m}{3^e}$, where $m$ and $e$ are non-negative integers. The number $\frac{45}{118}$ is not of that shape, so cannot be the answer for the problem, or for any closely related problem.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 31 '13 at 2:11             answered Jan 31 '13 at 1:49       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  It is impossible to get $45/118$ as OP mentioned. – Patrick Li  Jan 31 '13 at 1:57            i have no idea why that was the answer in the book, investigation time -.- – Ben Sewards  Jan 31 '13 at 1:59             @BenSewards You still didn't say the total number of questions. – Patrick Li  Jan 31 '13 at 1:59            no total number of questions were of concern in the question. Maybe a total of 5? I got the same answer as above, so I guess I'll stick with that in the future when it is the case. – Ben Sewards  Jan 31 '13 at 2:01         add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      A simple bit of logic can quickly prove that 45/118 is incorrect. The chance of guessing one answer on its own is 1/3.  45/118 is slightly more than 1/3 which means that guessing all 5 correctly is more probable than guessing only one correctly. This is obviously untrue as guessing each additional answer is increasingly less likely.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 10 '17 at 13:49       WDB   11 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

\end{array}  Only one of these $16$ sequences is correct.  Assuming each of these $16$ sequences is equally likely to occur (as would result from random guessing), the probability that all four questions are answered correctly is $1/16$.  If we assume that a person is equally likely to guess true or false on each question, then he or she has probability $1/2$ of answering each question correctly.  Under the assumption of independence , the probability that all four questions are answered correctly is 
$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}$$
We add probabilities of mutually exclusive events (events that cannot occur at the same time).  We multiply probabilities of independent events.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 25 '17 at 4:02             answered Jun 25 '17 at 3:51       N. F.

Since there are four questions, each has a 1/2 chance of getting the right answer. So to find it, you do (1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2). Therefore, for this case, there is a 1/16 chance of getting the right answer or (1/(2^4)) chance. Or a 6.25% chance.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 25 '17 at 3:29       Tom Himler   499 12                  Here is a tutorial on how to typeset mathematics on this site. – N.

A multiple choice test consists of 8 questions each with 4 choices. A student guesses the answers by choosing an answer at random. We can't use binomcdf or anything like that to find the answer  a) Compute the probability that the student answers 2 or more correctly.  b) If the student is able to eliminate one answer in each question as incorrect and chooses randomly from the other three choices, what is the probability the student answers 2 or more correctly?    probability  statistics  binomial-distribution     share | cite | improve this question     asked Oct 8 '15 at 15:35       Lauren Burke   158 1 9              add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  0  down vote  accepted      The simplest way to do (a) is to find the probability of answering 0 or only 1 correctly, then subtracting that from 1.  With four possible answer to each problem, the probability of answering one correctly by choosing at random is 1/4 and the probability of answering incorrectly is 3/4.  So the probability of answering all 8 questions incorrectly (0 correctly) is $(3/4)^8= 0.31640625$.  The probability of answering a specific question correctly and the other seven incorrectly is $(1/4)(3/4)^7= 0.033370971679685$.  The probability any one of the seven is correct and the other 3 incorrect is that times 8, 0.2669677734375.  The probability that either all 8 are incorrect or one is correct and the other 7 are incorrect is 0.31640625+ 0.2669677734375= 0.5833740234375.  The probability of answer 2 or more correctly is 1- 0.5833740234375= 0.4166259765625.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 8 '15 at 16:10       user247327   8,682 1 4 14              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

I used Number of Combinations, written en $nCr$ or $nCr(n, r)$.  $n$ = Number of questions.  $r$ = Chances of getting more than $X$ correct (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 correct).  $a$ = Number of choices per question.  $\textbf{Let's fill the blanks!}$  $n = 5$  $r = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$  $a = 4$  $P(X \geq 0) = 1 - P(X < 1)$ $\textbf{..can also be written as..}$ $1 - P(X = 0)$  The probability of getting 1 or more correct out of 5 by chance with 4 choices per item  The formula is $nCr$ * $(chances-of-getting-correct)^r$ * $(chances-of-getting-wrong)^{n-r}$  $\hspace{17.1mm} =1 - nCr(5, 0) * (1/a)^0 * 3/a)^{5-0}$  $\hspace{17.1mm} =1 - nCr(5, 0) * (1/4)^0 * (3/4)^{5-0}$  $\hspace{17.1mm} =1 - 1 * 1 * 0.237305$  $\hspace{17.1mm} = 0.762695$  $\hspace{17.1mm} = \textbf{76.27%}$  But what about getting 2 or more correct? Simple!  1 - chances of getting 0 correct + chances of getting 1 correct.  $P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X < 2)$  $\hspace{17.1mm} =1 - (nCr(5, 0) * (1/4)^0 * (3/4)^{5-0}$  $\hspace{18.5mm} + nCr(5, 1) * (1/4)^1 * (3/4)^{5-1})$  $\hspace{17.1mm} = 1 - 0.632813$  $\hspace{17.1mm} = 0.367188$  $\hspace{17.1mm} = \textbf{36.72%}$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 1 '17 at 17:29             answered May 31 '17 at 18:31       ingolfsson   1 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

But it cannot be 0% either, because then the correct answer would be 25%. So none of the answers are correct, so the answer must be 0%. But then it is 25%. And so forth.  It's a multiple-choice variant (with bells and whistles) of the classical liar paradox , which asks whether the statement   This statement is false.   is true or false. There are various more or less contrived "philosophical" attempts to resolve it, but by far the most common resolution is to deny that the statement means anything in the first place; therefore it is also meaningless to ask for its truth value.   Edited much later to add: There's a variant of this puzzle that's very popular on the internet at the moment, in which answer option (c) is 60% rather than 0%. In this variant it is at least internally consistent to claim that all of the answers are wrong, and so the possibility of getting a right one by choosing randomly is 0%.  Whether this actually resolves the variant puzzle is more a matter of taste and temperament than an objective mathematical question. It is not in general true for self-referencing questions that simply being internally consistent is enough for an answer to be unambiguously right; otherwise the question   Is the correct answer to this question "yes"?   would have two different "right" answers, because "yes" and "no" are both internally consistent. In the 60% variant of the puzzle it is happens that the only internally consistent answer is "0%", but even so one might, as a matter of caution, still deny that such reasoning by elimination is valid for self-referential statements at all. If one adopts this stance, one would still consider the 60% variant meaningless.  One rationale for taking this strict position would be that we don't want to accept reasoning by elimination on   True or false?   The Great Pumpkin exists.  Both of these statements are false.    where the only internally consistent resolution is that the first statement is true and the second one is false. However, it appears to be unsound to conclude that the Great Pumpkin exists on the basis simply that the puzzle was posed.  On the other hand, it is difficult to argue that there is no possible principle that will cordon off the Great Pumpkin example as meaningless while still allowing the 60% variant to be meaningful.  In the end, though, these things are more matters of taste and philosophy than they are mathematics. In mathematics we generally prefer to play it safe and completely refuse to work with explicitly self-referential statements. This avoids the risk of paradox, and does not seem to hinder mathematical arguments about the things mathematicians are ordinarily interested in. So whatever one decides to do with the question-about-itself, what one does is not really mathematics.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 1 '11 at 16:12             answered Oct 27 '11 at 22:31       Henning Makholm   214k 14 276 500              16      Liar paradox is also known as the Epimenides paradox after Epimenides of Crete who claimed: "All Cretans are liars". – GEL  Oct 28 '11 at 1:39        6      Bertrand's paradox, the proof of the halting problem, and the proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem all rely on similar self-referencing statements. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Oct 28 '11 at 7:29        14      @BlueRaja, are you on first names with Bertrand Russell ? Usually, "Bertrand's paradox" is about failure to specify a distribution when saying "chose a random chord in a circle". An interesting distinction for Gödel's argument (and the halting problem, which is closely analogous) is that in Gödel's case the self-referential statement doesn't itself know it's being self-referential. It just happens to be. If we do some trivial rewriting on it (such as swapping two conjuncts somewhere) it still means the same but is not exactly self-referential. – Henning Makholm  Oct 28 '11 at 10:13        1      Henning, I agree that @BlueRaja's formulation is overly ambiguous, see this other Bertrand paradox . – Did  Oct 28 '11 at 13:27        66      How dare you question the existence of the Great Pumpkin!? – joriki  Nov 1 '11 at 15:30        |  show 2 more comments            up vote  77  down vote      The question is underspecified since it doesn't say which distribution is used in choosing an answer at random.

If I choose a. with probability 50% and b. with probability 50%, b is correct.  If I choose a. with probability 75% and b. with probability 25%, c is correct.

If 25 percent is the "right" answer, then you actually have two options.  If you have 2 options, then 50 percent is the statistical answer. And if since 50 percent is the only option place to mark down, that means that you will only get this answer right 25 percent of the time because you have a 1 in four chance.  It is impossible without a miracle. Plus, if it is impossible then does that leave the option of 0 open because then there are no right answers? That is saying: "If there are no right answers, this is the right answer." What are you really saying there? Nothing.  I think maybe you can't find out how many answers there are in the first place. There can't be only one. There can't be only two. There can't be three. There can't be four, and therefore one is the right answer? No. Because then you start back at the beginning.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 28 '11 at 0:20       Robert Sturgis   261 2 2              1      I haven't downvoted, but I believe it could be just because it doesn't add anything new to the previous answers. – Mark Hurd  Jan 16 '14 at 1:33        add a comment |             up vote  11  down vote      Well, I must be pretty insane if I start competing with these already heavily upvoted answers from high rep users. But although the following solution may sound a little creative or even frivolous, it could easily be the right one. You could say that this solution is reverse engineered , as follows:  The question instructs to only choose one single answer out of four. And assume a uniform distribution, since that is most likely intended, then each answer has a chance of 25% to become chosen.  So the correct answer should be: 25%.  This computes to answer A being correct, as well as answer D. Could that be? Yes, it can. The question does not reveal how many of the four given answers are correct, but since there is one to be picked, assume that at least one of the four answers is correct.  Let's call answer A + answer D the correct answer pair.  Now, there are two possible choices (A or D) that result in 50% of the correct answer (A and D). Secondly, there is 50% chance of picking one (A or D) of two (A and D) out of four (A to D). So whether answer A or answer D is chosen, in either case the probability of being correct (50% × 50%) is 25%, which evaluates true.  Thus, yes, the question has 2 correct answers.  And now I realize that this post is the long version of the by joriki ages ago given comment. ;)   Ok, to be clear about what I mean, I believe the question is a special variant of the following trick question:   What is the color of the car?   Black  Blue  Gray  Metallic    As owner of the car I know the correct answer is metallic black. But this would render the question unfair, because it is never possible to give this answer by only selecting one. The difference with the question in question is the equality of both answers to give, which makes it slightly more fair. But since you can select only half of the full solution, the probability is still 25%.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 28 '11 at 8:33             answered Oct 28 '11 at 2:20       NGLN   238 1 7              3      If I'm reading your response correctly, you're both giving meaning to the answers (answers A and D are possibly correct because they are both 25%), and ignoring this meaning (by assuming that one of A or D is the "correct" answer, as in on an answer key or in a computer).

Don't look if you want to solve it yourself.   a) can't be the answer because it says b) is correct, but the statement of b) directly contradicts the statement of a)  c) can't be correct, because it means a) and b) are correct but they contradict each other  d) can't be correct.  If it were, it would imply a) or b) or c) to be correct.  The only possibility left is b), since I have already ruled out a) and c).  But, b) contradicts d).  b) can’t be correct for the same reason, basically.  If it were true, since a) and c) can’t be true, this would imply d) is correct.  But b) contradicts d).  f) can't be correct.  If it were, it would imply that e) is also correct, which would contradict the statement of f).  This leaves only e) and none of the statements contradict e) so e) must be the correct answer.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 28 '11 at 21:04             answered Oct 28 '11 at 20:21       Graphth   9,253 2 28 66                  So, what's wrong with a similar question that actually has a solution?

Submitted by david on Mon, 31/10/2011 - 8:49am   I recently tweeted a link to this problem drawn on a blackboard , which got a lot of retweets.  Multiple Choice: If you choose an answer to this question at random, what is the chance you will be correct? A) 25% B) 50% C) 60% D) 25%  This is a fun question whose paradoxical, self-referential nature quickly reveals itself – A) seems to be fine until one realizes the D) option is also 25%.  A quick search reveals hundreds of discussion contributions of this problem, for example here and here and from a year ago. People often appear very confident that their answer is the only possible solution.  I am no logician and so unqualified to place this within the grand structures of mathematical paradoxes. I have not waded through all the discussions and so there may be something I have missed, but in among all the arguments there seem to be four conclusions that could be considered as 'correct'. These are my personal comments:  1) There can be no solution, since the ambiguity of ‘correct’ makes the question ill-posed. It's true the question is ambiguous, but this still seems a bit of a cop-out.  2) There is no solution.  This seems to take this interpretation of the question.  Which answer (or set of answers) of “p%”, is such that the statement ‘the probability of picking such an answer is p%’ is true?  Then this appears to be a well-posed question, but there is no solution.  3)  0%.  Consider a different interpretation of the question.  Is there a p%, such that the statement ‘the probability of picking an answer “p%” is p%’ is true?  Then this appears a well-posed question and has the solution p = 0, even though this is not one of the answers.  Of course if answer C) were changed to “0%” (as it is in this 2007 version of the question ), then this would also have no solution.  4) We can produce any answer we want by changing the probability distribution for the choice.  Why should ‘random’ mean an equally likely chance of picking the 4 answers?   If we, say, assume the probabilities of choosing (A) (B) (C) (D) to be (10%, 20%, 60%, 10%) then the answer to either formulation (2) and (3) is now “60%”.  But if we make the distribution (12.5%, 15%, 60%, 12.5%) then we seem to back to square one again, since there is now both a 25% chance of picking “25%”, and a 60% chance of picking “60%”.  I like conclusion 3) best, ie 0% .  Maybe the main lesson is: ambiguity and paradox are often the basis for a good joke.

I give my reasoning at http://djmarsay.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/uncertainty-puzzle/ . I also give a variant that would be a probability if you thought that everything that looked like a well-formed question was, and that all probabilties are numeric. I think that it is well-formed, so it must be an example of a non-numeric probability. But you may want to ask a logician.

Let me give you a simple example to help you understand your error.  Multiple Choice:  If you flip a fair coin, what is the probability of getting heads? A) 75% B) 25% C) 100% D) All of the above E) None of the above  The answer is E.  That's how multiple choice questions are answered.  If you write 50% below the answers on the test paper, you would be marked wrong.  Writing a number is a NOT a valid answer to a multiple choice question even if the question is "what is the probability".  If you still think that the answer to the paradox is 0%, then you have shown a basic failure in your ability to follow instructions.  Let me give you another example:  Multiple Choice:  What is 1+1? A) 22 B) 11 C) 0  What is the answer?  There is no correct answer!  Would this question make you start making up nonsense answers like you did in the Paradox question?  Or would you just admit the question is stupid and has no answer?  Why is it that people can't grasp that the paradox question simply has no valid answer?  What is it about the question that causes people keep making up nonsense answers and try to argue in support of the nonsense?  It's like me saying the answer to this last question is A), and giving the reason that it is because the teacher just accidently made a typo when typing up the question and obviously meant to type a single 2! The question as written is clear, and the question as written, simply has no valid answer.  End of story.  Nothing else to discuss.

But the question states "this question"  So if I choose Yellow, Red, or ether Blue, I'm right... What if the implied question was whats my favorite color?

So in that sense the actual answer to the question isn't tied to the multiple choice options. An equivalent question would be:
What are the chances of answering this question "what is the capital of Spain" correct.
A) Paris B) London C) Tokyo D) Wellington. 
You would have a zero percent chance of answering the question correctly. Every option in the probability example is also wrong, therefore the answer is zero percent chance of answering correctly.

How many answers are right from a set of four possible answers? It is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4.  You also always have an answer to the question : 2. What is the probability of randomly picking the right answer from a set of four alternatives, given a fixed number of right answers? It is either 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%.  In this case they’re sort of asking you both questions simultaneously, since the content of the possible answers should be fixing and allowing you to discover both a. the number of right answers and b. the right answer  Once you give an answer to either 1 or 2 you immediately get an answer to the other. In this case none of those answers is actually fixed, you should discover both at the same time: hence the (apparent) problem. The trouble is that there are very there are some (actually very strict) constrains regarding the possible relation between a and b that are not being respected by the given possible answers: hence the incoherence. Notice that for someone to be able to pick an answer correctly the following conditions must be met: I)	There is one correct answer ←→ There is one and only one option = 25% II)	There are two correct answers ←→ There should be two and only two options = 50% III)	There are three correct answers ←→ There should be three and only three options = 75% IV)	There are four correct answers ←→ There should be four and only four options = 100% once you don’t respect this conditions you have an incompatibility between picking the right answer and picking the number of right answers, and so there is no way to answer the question and you should not be bogged by the appearance that there should be such an answer.

Then:  P(correct|right(25)) = 1/2 P(correct|right(50)) = 1/4 P(correct|right(65)) = 1/4  P(correct & right(25)) = 1/2 * 1/3 = 1/6 P(correct & right(50)) = 1/4 * 1/3 = 1/12 P(correct & right(65)) = 1/4 * 1/3 = 1/12  So P(correct) = 4/12 = 1/3  None of the a,b,c,d  Try again:  Four possible answers: a, b, c, d  Correct answer just 1/4  Again: But if we look at the content of the answers, then two of them are 1/4, so it's 1/2     Log in or register to post comments              mariahcareyhero1993   Fri, 07/03/2014 - 6:41pm   Permalink       but..........................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   BUT i think it should be 50 %.......
cause answer -A and -D can't be occur , it doesn't make sense .
BECAUSE , if you choose A , D also will be correct !!! , so the probability would be 50 % , , but the answer of A , D is 25 % , which means answer A , D will never be correct. !!!!!
so the options which works will only be B and C , so it s only 1/2 chance to get the correct answer ....
i am not sure , please suggest !!!!!    Log in or register to post comments              hole34   Sun, 01/06/2014 - 10:28am   Permalink       The answer  -----------------   The answer  -------------------                   ditch diggers     ------------------- -50%-

After coming up with a thousand different answers I jumped on here and saw I'd missed the point entirely. I looked at it like this:  The question says "If you pick an answer to this question at random..." I think that's loaded with implications...  It never says I have to choose an answer from the ones provided, just that I have to provide "an answer at random". It's not a 1 in 4 probability because I can give any answer I choose. "purple monkey dishwasher" is a valid answer. 17 is a valid answer. The question doesn't limit me to the four choices provided.  Pus, there are no values (numeric or otherwise) provided in the question. How is the answer calculated? Someone above asked "what if the question is 'what is the capital of Spain?'" Well then, there is an answer and only one correct answer. But what if the question was "what's your opinion of toasted cheese sandwiches?" What I mean is who decides whether the answer I provide is correct or not if there are no ways of calculating the answer in the first place? That implies to me that the answer is subject to evaluation and gradation by the person asking the question. I guess that would mean I can be anywhere from completely incorrect (zero%) or completely correct (100%). It's "correctness" is not a cold-hard right or wrong.  Finally, I thought "how can I know my chances of picking a correct answer if I don't know the question?". No question is provided. To which my friend replied "it IS the question". again, the wording is ambiguous. "If you provide an answer to THIS question". That means the question is self-referential. Wouldn't that mean it becomes an infinite regression, a logic-loop?  In the end I jumped online to find "the answer" only to discover I have missed the point entirely. I guess that's why my education ended in high school :) It's comforting to know that the university-educated aren't having much more luck than I am.  Oh, and I also felt that the question was attempting to be confusing by providing percentages as the answers. I started thinking it would be best to substitute the values provided with symbols ie:  A) 25% (substitute "orange") B) 50% ("apple") C) 60% ("banana") D) 25% ("orange")  as long as you still have 3 different answers out of four possible choices it removes the confusion but still leaves the same probability of getting the "right" answer; assuming you are approaching it as a probability question.

SEARCH  HOME       Math Central Quandaries & Queries          Question from Carla, a student:  You are taking a multiple choice quiz  that consist in 3 questions, each question has 3 possible answers only one is correct. To complete the quiz you randomly guess the answer to each question. Find the probability of guessing  exactly 2 answer correctly. b) at least to answer correctly . c)less than two answer correctly       Hi Carla.  If there were just one question, then the probability of guessing correctly would be 1/3.  Since all the answers are independent (the answer to one question has no bearing on the answers to the others), then this is the case with each question, so the chances of guessing all answers correctly is 1/3 × 1/3 × 1/3 = 1/27. Independent choices are linked by multiplication .  To have exactly 2 answers correct, we have to think of which one is wrong: there are 3 questions and any single one could be wrong. The probability that the first question is wrong is 2/3. And we know that the probabilities of the other two being right is 1/3 each, so the probability of just the first question being wrong and the others right is 2/3 × 1/3 × 1/3 = 2/27. But this is just one of the three cases: 1/3 × 2/3 × 1/3 and 1/3 × 1/3 × 2/3 also both equal 2/27 each. So here we add the cases together: 2/27 + 2/27 + 2/27 = 6/27 = 2/9. So the answer to part (a) of your question is 2/9.  To solve (b) Consider that (b) is the same as (a) with "all answers right" added in. So you can simply add answer (a) to the chance of guessing all answers correctly.  To solve (c) it might help you to think of the equivalent problem: what is the probability of getting 0 correct plus the probability of getting 1 correct?

The overall probabity will be the sum of the above probabilities: \(\frac{5!}{3!2!}*(\frac{1}{4})^3*(\frac{3}{4})^2+\frac{5!}{4!}*(\frac{1}{4})^4*(\frac{3}{4})+(\frac{1}{4})^5=\frac{53}{512}\).

Answer B Relevant topic for this question - Binomial probability distribution Being a straightforward technical question, I question its importance for a real test. _________________  PhD in Applied Mathematics Love GMAT Quant questions and running.                           mayankdangi      Intern           Joined: 15 Apr 2012   Posts: 8                      Re: In a multiple choice test comprising 5 Questions, each with [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     07 Aug 2012, 08:16      Here is my approach- Probability for choosing correct answer is 1/4 and incorrect answer is 3/4 For 3 correct answers, C(5,3)*(1/4)^3*(3/4)^2=90/(4^5) For 4 correct answers, C(5,4)*(1/4)^4*(3/4)^1=15/(4^5) For 5 correct answers, C(5,5)*(1/4)^5*(3/4)^0=1/(4^5) So total probability =106/1024 =53/512 Ans B                        mvictor      Board of Directors     P     Joined: 17 Jul 2014   Posts: 2735   Location: United States (IL)   Concentration: Finance, Economics   Schools:  Stanford '20 (WD)    GMAT 1 : 650 Q49 V30     GPA: 3.92   WE: General Management (Transportation)                         Re: In a multiple choice test comprising 5 Questions, each with [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     18 Mar 2016, 19:59       SOURH7WK wrote: In a multiple choice test comprising 5 Questions, each with 4 choices, what is the probability of a student getting 3 or more questions correct?

The powers of 9 will not deplete as fast as we have approximated since we only took the first digit after decimal. But we do get the idea that soon enough powers of .9 will go below 50%. Perhaps it will go less than 50% on the 7th power. So depending on the number of questions, the probability of answering all questions correctly can be more than 50% or less than 50%.

(1) For each question on the chemistry exam, Patty has a 90% chance of answering the question correctly. (2) There are fewer than 10 questions on Patty's chemistry exam. Opt1). Probability the she answers correctly, P(C) = 0.9 therefore, probability for wrong answer, P(W) = 0.1 if number of questions on the test is 2, then P(C) = (0.9)^2 = 0.81 --------------------------------------------3------------- = (0.9)^3 = 0.729 examine the pattern , Probability of getting correct answers will reduce with the increase in number of questions since no information about the number of questions is provided, this option is not sufficient. Opt.2) there are fewer than 10 questions. This is still not sufficient as no information about the probability of correctly answering the question is provided. It can be 1, 0.5, 0.9 or anything. Not sufficient. opt1 & opt2 together are still not sufficient. if number of questions is 4 , P(getting all correct) = (0.9)^4 = ~0.64 this probability will decrease with the subsequent increase in the number of questions. Hence, both statements together are not sufficient. Answer.

(1) For each question on the chemistry exam, Patty has a 90% chance of answering the question correctly. (2) There are fewer than 10 questions on Patty's chemistry exam. Let's phrase what we are looking for: Let's assume that all the questions are independent from each other, and that each question have an euqal chance to be solved by Patty - lets denote the chance to solve correctly with P. In addition, let's denote the number of questions in the test with N So, the question asks to find out if (p)^n>0.5. St1. - since 0.5 = 5/10, we can see that (9/10)^2 will be greater than 5/10 only for n=1. if n>1, the answer will be no. St.2 Based on the mentioned above this statment does not give us any new information. To conclude-> answer is E.                        shashankism      Director        P     Joined: 13 Mar 2017   Posts: 591   Location: India   Concentration: General Management, Entrepreneurship   GPA: 3.8   WE: Engineering (Energy and Utilities)                      Re: Is the probability that Patty will answer all of the questio [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     22 Aug 2017, 07:37       pkhats wrote: Is the probability that Patty will answer all of the questions on her chemistry exam correctly greater than 50%?

DS: probability that Patty will answer all of the questions on her chemistry exam correctly > 50% ?

Because the question ask for "at least". 0.2^4 will give you the probability of getting them all right, which is a possibility, but the possibility of getting "at least" one right is much higher than that.                           anonymousegmat      Senior Manager           Joined: 14 Jun 2007   Posts: 395                        [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     06 Aug 2007, 19:16       Robin in NC wrote: trancing wrote: I think it goes like this: prob (>= 1 correct) = 1 - prob (0 correct) = 1 - (0.8^4) = 1 - 256/625 = 369/625=0.59 Answer D Hope this helps.

What makes these problems a bit messy is that we're dealing with a 9-question test.  If this was about a single question, it's not too horrible.  But here, it's asking the probability of getting four questions right out of nine, so I've got a bit of an issue.  It doesn't tell me which four questions I got right or wrong!  I could answer the first four questions right, or questions 2/5/7/8, or questions 3/6/8/9...you get the idea.  There are a lot of different ways of doing that, and then for each of those questions, I have a 1 in 4 chance that I got it right.  How do we deal with both of those issues at the same time?    Thankfully, there's a formula for this.  :)  Because each question on the test is either right or wrong, we're dealing with something called a binomial experiment...and then there's a formula for binomial probabilities.    The probability of getting exactly k successes in n attempts is equal to:    P( k successes in n attempts) = n C k * (p k ) * (q n-k )    In this specific problem, I've got 9 attempts to get exactly 4 questions right.  So, can you figure out what n and k are from that?    - The big C is "n choose k," which you hopefully have covered in your class...and your calculator will do it for you.  - The little p is "the probability of success on a single attempt."  So, in this problem, what is my chance of getting a single question right?  And then we raise that to the k power.  - The little q is "the probability of failure on a single attempt."  In this problem, what is my chance of getting a single question wrong?  - The "n - k" in the exponent is something we should be able to figure out by now, because we know n and k.  "n - k" will tell us how many failures we'll get out of our n attempts.  (In this problem, how many questions will we get wrong on the test if we got exactly 4 right?)    Hope this helps!         4/10/2015 | Michael W.

When I punch everything into my calculator...if I did it right...I get a probability of .118, or 11.8%.             4/10/2015 |  Michael W.
