Although some heart attacks are sudden and intense, most start slowly, with mild pain or discomfort. Pay attention to your body — and call 911 if you feel: Chest discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain.  Discomfort in other areas of the upper body. Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.  Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.  Other signs may include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness. Download our heart attack warning signs infographic. Symptoms Vary Between Men and Women As with men, women's most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort . But women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particularly shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and back or jaw pain . Learn about the warning signs of heart attack in women .  Act Fast Learn the signs, but remember this: Even if you're not sure it's a heart attack, have it checked out. Minutes matter! Fast action can save lives — maybe your own. Don't wait - call 911 or your emergency response number. Call 911 Calling 911 is almost always the fastest way to get lifesaving treatment.

      one. By taking action you can significantly reduce your chance for a second heart
      attack.  Risk factors  These factors increase your risk for another heart attack, according to experts:    Inactive lifestyle    Being overweight or obese    High cholesterol    High blood sugar, if you have diabetes    High blood pressure    Smoking    Excess stress    What you should do  The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends the following actions to reduce your
      risk for a second heart attack:     Quit smoking. You can cut your risk for another heart attack in half by not smoking. Talk to your
            healthcare provider about a smoking cessation program or nicotine replacement products.
            This is the biggest preventable risk factor for heart disease.    Eat a heart-healthy diet. By cutting back on saturated fat and trans fat, you can lower your LDL ("bad") cholesterol.
            This is one of the primary substances that causes heart attacks. Manufacturers are
            reducing or eliminating trans fats from their products. You can avoid most trans fatty
            acids, however, by eating less margarine and fewer cookies, crackers, fries, doughnuts,
            and other snack foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils. It's important to
            continue this eating pattern even when you eat out.    Control your cholesterol. Besides eating a heart-healthy diet, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop
            Hypertension) diet, you can help keep your cholesterol under control by exercising
            regularly. Your healthcare provider may also prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medicine,
            such as a statin. It's important to take this medicine as prescribed. Talk to your
            healthcare provider if you have any concerns.    Exercise regularly. Exercise is important because it strengthens your heart muscle. It also boosts your
            energy level and helps with weight management, cholesterol, and blood pressure. The
            AHA recommends a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of walking or other moderately vigorous
            exercise at least 3 to 5 times each week. If you've had a heart attack, you must get
            your healthcare provider's OK before starting an exercise program. If you have any
            of these symptoms during exercise, call your healthcare provider immediately:    Shortness of breath that lasts for more than 10 minutes    Chest pain or pain in your arms, neck, jaw, or stomach    Dizzy spells    Pale or splotchy skin    Very fast heartbeat or irregular heartbeat    Cold sweats    Nausea and vomiting    Weakness, swelling, or pain in your legs      Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight greatly increases your risk for a second heart attack. If you need
            to lose weight, ask your healthcare provider for help. Your BMI (body mass index)
            should be between 18.5 and 24.9. This is the healthiest range.    Control high blood pressure. Follow your healthcare provider's suggestions.    Assess your mental health. Depression, stress, anxiety, and anger can damage your heart and overall health. Talk
            with your healthcare provider about seeing a therapist if you need help with your
            emotions.    Take your medicines as directed. Your heart, cholesterol, and blood pressure medicines are an important part of your
            heart health. If you have any questions about them, talk with your healthcare provider
            or your pharmacist.

A stent is a small mesh tube that's used to treat narrow or weak arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from your heart to other parts of your body.  A stent is placed in an artery as part of a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty. PCI restores blood flow through narrow or blocked arteries. A stent helps support the inner wall of the artery in the months or years after PCI.  Doctors also may place stents in weak arteries to improve blood flow and help prevent the arteries from bursting.  Stents usually are made of metal mesh, but sometimes they're made of fabric. Fabric stents, also called stent grafts, are used in larger arteries.  Some stents are coated with medicine that is slowly and continuously released into the artery. These stents are called drug-eluting stents. The medicine helps prevent the artery from becoming blocked again.                     How Are Stents Used?                    For the Coronary Arteries Doctors may use stents to treat coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis . Plaque narrows the coronary arteries, reducing the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart. This can lead to chest pain or discomfort called angina . The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your coronary arteries. If blood clots block a coronary artery, a heart attack will occur. Doctors may use percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, and stents to treat CHD. During PCI, a thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrow or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery, which reduces angina and other CHD symptoms. Unless an artery is too small, a stent usually is placed in the treated portion of the artery during PCI. The stent supports the artery's inner wall. It also reduces the chance that the artery will become narrow or blocked again. A stent also can support an artery that was torn or injured during PCI. Even with a stent, there's about a 10–20 percent chance that an artery will become narrow or blocked again in the first year after PCI. When a stent isn't used, the risk can be as much as 10 times as high. Research has shown that as time goes by, people who have coronary artery stents are in less danger of risks from the surgery but more prone to the risks of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and renal failure. For the Carotid Arteries Doctors also may use stents to treat carotid artery disease . This is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that run along each side of your neck. These arteries, called carotid arteries, supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. The buildup of plaque in the carotid arteries limits blood flow to your brain and puts you at risk for a stroke . Doctors use stents to help support the carotid arteries after they're widened with PCI. Researchers continue to explore the risks and benefits of carotid artery stenting. For Other Arteries Plaque also can narrow other arteries, such as those in the kidneys and limbs. Narrow kidney arteries can affect kidney function and lead to severe high blood pressure . Narrow arteries in the limbs, a condition called peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.), can cause pain and cramping in the affected arm or leg. Severe narrowing can completely cut off blood flow to a limb, which could require surgery. To relieve these problems, doctors may do PCI on a narrow kidney, arm, or leg artery. They often will place a stent in the affected artery during the procedure. The stent helps support the artery and keep it open. For the Aorta in the Abdomen or Chest The aorta is a major artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left side of the heart to the body. This artery runs through the chest and down into the abdomen. Over time, some areas of the aorta's walls can weaken. These weak areas can cause a bulge in the artery called an aneurysm . An aneurysm in the aorta can burst, leading to serious internal bleeding. When aneurysms occur, they're usually in the abdominal aorta. To help avoid a burst, doctors may place a fabric stent in the weak area of the abdominal aorta. The stent creates a stronger inner lining for the artery. Aneurysms also can develop in the part of the aorta that runs through the chest. Doctors also use stents to treat these aneurysms. How well the stents work over the long term still isn't known. To Close Off Aortic Tears Another problem that can occur in the aorta is a tear in its inner wall. If blood is forced into the tear, it will widen. The tear can reduce blood flow to the tissues that the aorta serves. Over time, the tear can block blood flow through the artery or burst. If this happens, it usually occurs in the chest portion of the aorta. Researchers are developing and testing new kinds of stents that will prevent blood from flowing into aortic tears. A stent placed within the torn area of the aorta might help restore normal blood flow and reduce the risk of a burst aorta.                     How Are Stents Placed?                    Doctors place stents in arteries as part of a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty. To place a stent, your doctor will make a small opening in a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh), arm, or neck.  Through this opening, your doctor will thread a thin, flexible tube called a catheter. The catheter will have a deflated balloon at its tip.  A stent is placed around the deflated balloon. Your doctor will move the tip of the catheter to the narrow section of the artery or to the aneurysm or aortic tear site.  Special x-ray movies will be taken of the tube as it's threaded through your blood vessel. These movies will help your doctor position the catheter.  For Arteries Narrowed by Plaque  Your doctor will use special dye to help show narrow or blocked areas in the artery. He or she will then move the catheter to the area and inflate the balloon.  As the balloon inflates, it pushes the plaque against the artery wall. This widens the artery and helps restore blood flow. The fully extended balloon also expands the stent, pushing it into place in the artery.  The balloon is deflated and pulled out along with the catheter. The stent remains in your artery. Over time, cells in your artery grow to cover the mesh of the stent. They create an inner layer that looks like the inside of a normal blood vessel.  Coronary Artery Stent Placement      Figure A shows the location of the heart and coronary arteries. Figure B shows the deflated balloon catheter and closed stent inserted into the narrow coronary artery. The inset image shows a cross-section of the artery with the inserted balloon catheter and closed stent. In figure C, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent and compressing the plaque against the artery wall. Figure D shows the stent-widened artery. The inset image shows a cross-section of the compressed plaque and stent-widened artery.   A very narrow artery, or one that's hard to reach with a catheter, may require more steps to place a stent. At first, your doctor may use a small balloon to expand the artery. He or she then removes the balloon.  The small balloon is replaced with a larger balloon that has a collapsed stent around it. At this point, your doctor can follow the standard process of compressing the plaque and placing the stent.  Doctors use a special filter device when doing PCI and stent placement on the carotid arteries. The filter helps keep blood clots and loose pieces of plaque from traveling to the brain during the procedure.  For Aortic Aneurysms  The procedure to place a stent in an artery with an aneurysm is very similar to the one described above. However, the stent used to treat an aneurysm is different. It's made out of pleated fabric instead of metal mesh, and it often has one or more tiny hooks.  The stent is expanded to fit tight against the artery wall. The hooks latch on to the wall of the artery, holding the stent in place.  The stent creates a new inner lining for that portion of the artery. Over time, cells in the artery grow to cover the fabric. They create an inner layer that looks like the inside of a normal blood vessel.                     What To Expect Before a Stent Procedure                    Most stent procedures require an overnight stay in a hospital and someone to take you home. Talk with your doctor about:  When to stop eating and drinking before coming to the hospital  What medicines you should or shouldn't take on the day of the procedure  When to come to the hospital and where to go  If you have diabetes, kidney disease, or other conditions, ask your doctor whether you need to take any extra steps during or after the procedure to avoid complications.  Before the procedure, your doctor may talk to you about medicines you'll likely need to take after the stent is placed. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the stent.  You'll need to know how long you should take these medicines and why they're important. For more information about these medicines, go to "What To Expect After a Stent Procedure."                     What To Expect During a Stent Procedure                    For Arteries Narrowed by Plaque This procedure usually takes about an hour. It might take longer if stents are inserted into more than one artery during the procedure. Before the procedure starts, you'll get medicine to help you relax. You'll be on your back and awake during the procedure. This allows you to follow your doctor's instructions. Your doctor will numb the area where the catheter will be inserted. You won't feel the doctor threading the catheter, balloon, or stent inside the artery. You may feel some pain when the balloon is expanded to push the stent into place. For Aortic Aneurysms Although this procedure takes only a few hours, it often requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Before the procedure, you'll be given medicine to help you relax. If your doctor is placing the stent in your abdominal aorta, you may receive medicine to numb your stomach area. However, you'll be awake during the procedure. If your doctor is placing the stent in the chest portion of your aorta, you'll likely receive medicine to make you sleep during the procedure. Once you're numb or asleep, your doctor will make a small cut in your groin (upper thigh). He or she will insert a catheter into the blood vessel through this cut. Sometimes two cuts (one in the groin area of each leg) are needed to place fabric stents that come in two parts. You will not feel the doctor threading the catheter, balloon, or stent into the artery.                     What To Expect After a Stent Procedure                    Recovery  After either type of stent procedure (for arteries narrowed by plaque or aortic aneurysms), your doctor will remove the catheter from your artery. The site where the catheter was inserted will be bandaged.  A small sandbag or other type of weight may be put on top of the bandage to apply pressure and help prevent bleeding. You'll recover in a special care area, where your movement will be limited.  While you're in recovery, a nurse will check your heart rate and blood pressure regularly. The nurse also will look to see whether you're bleeding from the insertion site.  Eventually, a small bruise and sometimes a small, hard "knot" will appear at the insertion site. This area may feel sore or tender for about a week.  You should let your doctor know if:  You have a constant or large amount of bleeding at the insertion site that can't be stopped with a small bandage  You have any unusual pain, swelling, redness, or other signs of infection at or near the insertion site  Common Precautions After a Stent Procedure  Blood Clotting Precautions  After a stent procedure, your doctor will likely recommend that you take aspirin and another anticlotting medicine. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the stent. A blood clot can lead to a heart attack , stroke , or other serious problems.  If you have a metal stent, your doctor may recommend aspirin and another anticlotting medicine for at least 1 month. If your stent is coated with medicine, your doctor may recommend aspirin and another anticlotting medicine for 12 months or more. Your doctor will work with you to decide the best course of treatment.  Your risk of blood clots significantly increases if you stop taking the anticlotting medicine too early. Taking these medicines for as long as your doctor recommends is important. He or she may recommend lifelong treatment with aspirin.  If you're considering surgery for some other reason while you're on these medicines, talk to your doctor about whether it can wait until after you've stopped the medicine. Anticlotting medicines may increase the risk of bleeding.  Also, anticlotting medicines can cause side effects, such as an allergic rash. Talk to your doctor about how to reduce the risk of these side effects.  Other Precautions  You should avoid vigorous exercise and heavy lifting for a short time after the stent procedure. Your doctor will let you know when you can go back to your normal activities.  Metal detectors used in airports and other screening areas don't affect stents. Your stent shouldn't cause metal detectors to go off.  If you have an aortic fabric stent, your doctor will likely recommend followup imaging tests (for example, chest x ray ) within the first year of having the procedure. After the first year, he or she may recommend yearly imaging tests.  Lifestyle Changes  Stents help prevent arteries from becoming narrow or blocked again in the months or years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty. However, stents aren't a cure for atherosclerosis or its risk factors.  Making lifestyle changes can help prevent plaque from building up in your arteries again. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for atherosclerosis and the lifestyle changes you'll need to make.  Lifestyle changes may include changing your diet, quitting smoking , being physically active , losing weight , and reducing stress . You also should take all medicines as your doctor prescribes. Your doctor may suggest taking statins, which are medicines that lower blood cholesterol levels.

Risks Related to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the procedure used to place stents, is a medical procedure that is commonly known as coronary angioplasty. PCI carries a small risk of serious complications, such as:  Bleeding from the site where the catheter was inserted into the skin  Damage to the blood vessel from the catheter  Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)  Damage to the kidneys caused by the dye used during the procedure  An allergic reaction to the dye used during the procedure  Infection  Another problem that can occur after PCI is too much tissue growth within the treated portion of the artery. This can cause the artery to become narrow or blocked again. When this happens, it's called restenosis (RE-sten-no-sis).  Using drug-eluting stents can help prevent this problem. These stents are coated with medicine to stop excess tissue growth.  Treating the tissue around the stent with radiation also can delay tissue growth. For this procedure, the doctor threads a wire through a catheter to the stent. The wire releases radiation and stops cells around the stent from growing and blocking the artery.  Restenosis of a Stent-Widened Coronary Artery      Figure A shows the coronary arteries located on the surface of the heart. Figure B shows a stent-widened artery with normal blood flow. The inset image shows a cross-section of the stent-widened artery. In figure C, tissue grows through and around the stent over time. This causes a partial blockage of the artery and abnormal blood flow. The inset image shows a cross-section of the tissue growth around the stent.

This causes a partial blockage of the artery and abnormal blood flow. The inset image shows a cross-section of the tissue growth around the stent.  Risks Related to Stents  About 1–2 percent of people who have stented arteries develop a blood clot at the stent site. Blood clots can cause a heart attack , stroke , or other serious problems. The risk of blood clots is greatest during the first few months after the stent is placed in the artery.  Your doctor will likely recommend that you take aspirin and another anticlotting medicine, such as clopidogrel, for at least 1 month or up to a year or more after having a stent procedure. These medicines help prevent blood clots.  The length of time you need to take anticlotting medicines depends on the type of stent you have. Your doctor may recommend lifelong treatment with aspirin.  Stents coated with medicine may raise your risk of dangerous blood clots. (These stents often are used to keep clogged heart arteries open.) However, research hasn't proven that these stents increase the chances of having a heart attack or dying, if used as recommended.  Risks Related to Aortic Stents in the Abdomen  Although rare, a few serious problems can occur when surgery or a fabric stent is used to repair an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta. These problems include:  A burst artery (aneurysm rupture).  Blocked blood flow to the stomach or lower body.  Paralysis in the legs due to interruption of blood flow to the spinal cord. This problem is very rare.  Another possible problem is the fabric stent moving further down the aorta. This sometimes happens years after the stent is first placed. The stent movement may require a doctor to place another fabric stent in the area of the aneurysm.

Risk for Repeat Heart Attacks   By MELISSA SCHORR  B O S T O N, Sept. 27   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The good news: You’ve just survived a heart attack. The bad news: Your heart troubles could get worse, if your attack was caused by one of several “vulnerable plaques” — tiny, inflamed buildups of fat that burst and plug up blood vessels — any of which could be a ticking time bomb for another attack. Doctors have come to believe as many as two-thirds of all heart attacks are caused by these vulnerable plaques brewing on blood vessel walls, which become inflamed and suddenly rupture for undetermined reasons. The other third are due to fatty blockages, or clogged arteries, and rarely, vessel spasms. A new study being published in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine lends further credence to the theory that plaques in several locations throughout the heart’s vessels increase the likelihood of further heart disruptions. Tip of the Iceberg
“When you have a heart attack, the area that emerges is the tip of the iceberg,” explains the study’s lead author, James A. Goldstein, a cardiologist at the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. “There is corrosion in the pipes throughout the house.” In the study, Goldstein and his colleagues examined the angiograms, or the X-ray images of the heart’s blood vessels, from 253 heart attack patients and found that 40 percent of them had several remaining unstable plaques throughout the vessels in their hearts. Those patients with the multiple plaques, he found, were more likely to be repeat offenders for heart attack within the year. They were also more likely to develop symptoms that require repeated repeat angioplasty or bypass surgery, he says. Goldstein says these findings may suggest a new treatment style for heart attack patients, including taking megadoses of cholesterol-lowering drugs and anti-inflamatory medications immediately after the attack to stabilize the remaining plaques, as well as interventional surgery on the plaques that look especially “nasty” and rupture-prone.  Treatment Unclear
But experts say they have yet to determine the best way to treat these vulnerable plaques to prevent them from doing damage. This month, cardiologists met at a conference held in New York City to discuss the best ways to identify and treat plaques. “At this point, we’re not certain of the right treatment — aggressive lipid-lowering or addressing these lesions specifically,” says Dr. Sergio Waxman, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, who presented research at the meeting. “There are some data that suggest that being more aggressive is associated with more benefit.” Waxman adds it may be cheaper to treat the patient with drug interventions than performing costly surgery on each lesion, such as implanting a stent, a wire mesh placed in the blood vessel to hold back any obstruction. Others doctors are exploring different potential methods of treating the plaques, such as using heat or gene therapy, says Dr. James Willerson, medical director of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston. The important message from this study is that heart attack victims need to remain on top of their treatment, says Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston.
.
“The perception is that you have an aggressive treatment for a heart attack, you go home and you’re fixed,” Cannon says. “This is a pretty strong reminder that isn’t always the case — there are other lesions that can cause problems. You really have to follow through with your treatment.” Plaque Prevention
The findings may also have implications for those who have not suffered a heart attack, but are concerned about their future heart health. In addition to an angiogram, a simple blood test that measures something called C-reactive protein and amyloid protein can be performed to test whether inflammation is present in the body, indicating these vulnerable plaques are present, says study author Goldstein. But the test is not yet widely available.  The plaques also can be aggressively treated with cholesterol-lowering medications, which have been shown to lessen a chance of a rupture by somehow stabilizing the plaques, says Dr. James Januzzi a cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a member of their Vulnerable Plaque Project. Unfortunately, there is still no way to accurate predict which plaque will go on to rupture and cause a heart attack. “That’s the million-dollar question,” sighs Januzzi. “This doesn’t solve that problem — but it adds all sorts of enthusiasm towards finding a technology that can.”        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Afterward, he went back to his high-stress job at a financial services company. That night, he ended up in the emergency room - thanks to his anxious wife who took him there - after he'd felt pain and a weight "like an elephant sitting on my chest." Steve had had a myocardial infarction (MI), more commonly known as a heart attack. For him and his family, it was a major wake-up call. With one child in high school and another in college, a mortgage, and elderly parents to worry about, Steve couldn't afford to be sick. He also couldn't afford to go on living the way he had been. Like many baby boomers, Steve thought he would stay young forever. But a lifetime of less-than-healthy eating, diminishing physical activity, and workplace stress - not to mention some predispositions inherited from his father - had caught up with him. Steve's not alone. Dr. Fred Leya, director of interventional cardiology at the Loyola University Health System in Chicago, one of the top-ranked U.S. heart hospitals, says that baby boomers are entering a higher-risk period for heart attack. Men enter this period in their late 40s; women, in their mid-50s. "Baby boomers need to focus carefully on the state of their health, including lifetime cardiovascular risk control," says Leya. "Genetics, on top of smoking , diabetes , high blood pressure, lack of exercise, and other cardiovascular risk factors, plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries." To reduce the risk of heart attack, boomers should learn their risk factors and control them. "Know your numbers - the good and bad cholesterol, HDL and LDL; blood pressure; heart rate; glucose - and check them annually," says Leya. After evaluation and treatment, Steve underwent an angioplasty and received a stent - a small stainless-steel scaffold to keep blood vessels open and maintain blood flow to the heart. He was sent home with a list of admonitions from his doctor, who also enlisted Steve's family in helping him get better and stay better. Although each patient is different, and each situation may call for variations in approach, according to the American Heart Association, patients routinely feel worried and upset after a heart attack. A heart attack is an emotional as well as a physical event, and the emotions affect everyone in the family. Caregivers should encourage heart attack survivors to talk about their feelings of fear, anxiety, irritation, depression, and anger. Remember that these are normal and usually disappear on their own - within two to six months after the event. However, caregivers should watch for signs of serious depression . Some studies have shown that serious depression heightens the risk of a second heart attack. If you think the person you are caring for is seriously depressed, consult a professional. If you are caring for someone who is recovering from a heart attack, there are several areas of concern you should familiarize yourself with. The following information will help you help the patient - you'll feel more in control and able to manage your own feelings of anxiety. What about pain? You - and the person you're caring for - will probably wonder if chest pain is normal after a heart attack. Not all heart attack survivors experience it, but some do feel light pain or pressure in the chest (angina pectoris) during or right after physical exertion, after a heavy meal, or when feeling powerful emotions. Keep the doctor apprised of this pain and how it progresses - treatment is available. It's especially important to contact a doctor if angina gets worse over time. What about work? A heart attack doesn't have to end a career. Most people go back to work anywhere from two weeks to three months after having a heart attack, but some may need to make adjustments in the type of work they do and the amount of stress or physical demand their job entails. What about driving? Most people who have had a heart attack without complications can resume driving within a week, provided they follow state law. Some states have special restrictions for people recovering from serious illness, such as not driving alone or not driving at night. Commercial drivers must wait two months and be recertified before they can go back to work. What about sex? Most people can return to their usual pattern of sexual activity after they recover from a heart attack. According to the American Heart Association, a patient should be ready to have sex once he or she is able to walk around easily. If chest pain occurs during sex, you and your loved one can talk to a doctor about treatment. What about exercise? It's likely that a heart attack patient will need more physical activity than before the attack, but it's important to exercise safely. Consider a cardiac rehabilitation program at a hospital or clinic in your area. In these programs, physical activity is designed specifically for heart health and is closely monitored. What about rest? Getting a good night's rest is important for heart attack patients. A nap or short rest during the day is a good idea, too. Heart patients should always rest before they get too tired. And why not take a cue from new parents: Use naptime to grab a few winks yourself! You, too, are under strain during this recovery period. What if there's another heart attack? Know the warning signs of a heart attack and act fast when you see them. The signs and symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, indigestion, nausea, and pain in the back, neck, or jaw. Someone in your family might want to take a CPR course - not only to be prepared but also to learn more about how to recognize a heart attack if it happens. What About the Future? Many, many people recover fully from their heart attacks and go on to lead long, healthier lives. You can help the person you are caring for do that by making sure that he or she follows the ABCs of prevention: Avoid tobacco. Smoking after a heart attack doubles your chances of having a second one, according to the American Heart Association. Become more active. Regular exercise or activity at a cardiac rehabilitation program can make a significant difference. Physical activity eases stress and depression, helps control weight, and can lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Choose good nutrition. Healthful eating will help control weight, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and help the body heal faster. This is good advice for everyone in the family - not just the heart attack survivor.

It’s an experience you don’t want to repeat, ever.    From the Pritikin Longevity Center, learn in this article how to prevent a second heart attack. And start a new life, a better life. For the last four decades, Pritikin's renowned experts have helped thousands worldwide. The success of Pritikin's heart-healthy lifestyle is proven in 100+ studies.         Decreasing heart attack risk depends largely on your lifestyle. Healthy changes in the way you live, particularly diet and exercise, have been proven to dramatically reduce major risk factors.   How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack  To understand how to prevent a second heart attack, it’s important to understand why the first heart attack likely occurred, and what heart disease is.  It’s also important to understand that you’re not alone.  Heart disease is the #1 killer in the U.S. of both men and women. The Centers for Disease Control has estimated that someone in America is having a heart attack every 34 seconds. Every 60 seconds someone is dying from a heart disease-related event.  What Is Heart Disease?  Most heart disease results from an inflammatory process within the arteries called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis injures and clogs arteries, and it can develop in any artery of the body.  Preventing a second heart attack means preventing plaque growth.  Plaque  The material inside the arteries causing the blockage is commonly referred to as plaque. Plaque causes the inner walls of the arteries to balloon and swell to accommodate the space that plaque occupies. The process becomes critical when small blood clots form near the plaque, which can completely choke blood flow to vital organs.  In most cases, it is the sudden rupture of the weakened area (plaque) that triggers blood clots and stops blood flow, causing an interruption in the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the involved organ (heart, brain, etc.). Depending upon which cells and tissues die, the result could be a heart attack, stroke, or other circulatory problem.  Heart Disease Risk Factors  Plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries for many reasons. Here are four key risk factors:    High forms of bad cholesterol, such as LDL and non-HDL The higher the bad cholesterol concentration in your blood, the more plaque you are likely to have, and the more damaged your artery walls become.  High glucose (blood sugar)  Hypertension (high blood pressure)  Smoking    How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack  Decreasing heart attack risk depends largely on your lifestyle. Healthy changes in the way you live, particularly diet and exercise, have been proven to:    Dramatically reduce heart disease risk factors like high LDL and non-HDL cholesterol, high glucose, and hypertension  Stabilize plaques  Slow down, and even reverse the progression of coronary heart disease.    Diet – The Most Significant Lifestyle-Related Factor  Reducing saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol in your diet will help prevent a second heart attack.  A large body of research (detailed later in this article) has found that the following dietary characteristics, all part of the Pritikin Eating Plan , are effective in reducing bad cholesterol and other risk factors, and reverses the progression of heart disease:    Reduce saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol in the diet.  Foods rich in saturated fats include red meats, processed meats like bacon and bologna, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and fatty dairy foods like cheese, ice cream, butter, and whole milk.  Foods high in trans fats are often margarines, fries, donuts, cookies, crackers, and other snack foods. Avoid foods containing partially hydrogenated oil – i.e., trans fat.  Foods especially high in dietary cholesterol are egg yolks and organ meats.   Increase fiber in the form of whole, nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans.     Other Key Lifestyle-Related Measures To Prevent Heart Attacks Include:    Smoking cessation  Blood pressure control  Physical activity  Weight management , particularly reductions in abdominal (belly) fat  Blood sugar control  Stress management      Medical Care How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack   No matter how healthy your lifestyle, it’s vital to consult regularly with your cardiologist to give your heart optimal protection. Physician-supervised care, states the National, Heart, and Blood Institute , should involve not only lifestyle-change education but also:   Medicines, if needed, to control chest pain or discomfort, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and your heart’s workload  A cardiac rehabilitation program    A new Medicare-approved form of cardiac rehabilitation, called intensive cardiac rehabilitation (ICR), is now being conducted at the Pritikin Longevity Center .  Medicare May Partially Cover Your Stay At Pritikin Did you know that M​edicare coverage is now accepted at the Pritikin Longevity Center for qualifying individuals? Find Out If You Qualify  Like traditional cardiac rehab (CR) programs, Pritikin’s ICR program focuses on exercise. But it also provides comprehensive education in all the key skills that foster a healthy lifestyle, including food shopping, cooking, dining out, smoking cessation, and reducing the stress in your life.   What Science Says How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack   Below is a summary of key research over the last three decades on the benefits of lifestyle interventions for the heart:  The Intensive Cardiac Rehab program at the Pritikin Center in Miami, Florida, is lauded by many as the best available. Oprah.com called Pritikin “the gold standard.” The New York Times described Pritikin as the “the granddaddy of health-based wellness spas.” If you’ve had a heart attack, your life-transforming vacation at the Pritikin Center may be covered in part by Medicare.    Sixty-four patients with coronary artery disease were recommended by their cardiologists to have bypass surgery. Instead, they chose to attend the Pritikin Longevity Center. In the follow-up study conducted five years after the patients had left Pritikin, researchers at UCLA reported that 80% of the patients had never needed bypass surgery. In addition, 68% of those who had suffered from angina (chest pain) before coming to Pritikin reported being completely free of angina. 1  Scientists at University of Southern California showed that a combination of drugs and diet decreased plaque lesions in the arteries of humans. 2  Researchers at University of California, San Francisco, showed that lifestyle changes – a low-fat, fiber-rich diet, regular exercise, and stress management – caused shrinking of plaque in most people with atherosclerosis, and without the need for any heart or cholesterol-reducing medications. 3  The Stanford Coronary Risk Intervention Project followed 300 people with coronary artery disease for four years. Half were assigned to usual care (no lifestyle intervention), and half received intensive lifestyle education in dietary change, exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management. The best predictor of new coronary blockages was dietary fat intake. As fat intake rose, the number of coronary blockages rose. Those patients with the lowest intake of dietary fat (about 10% to 15%, like the Pritikin Eating Plan) had the greatest amount of plaque shrinkage, or regression. 4  Caldwell B. Esselstyn, Jr., MD, at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation found that a plant-based diet in conjunction with cholesterol-reducing medication reversed heart disease in 70% of patients over a 12-year period. All patients who maintained the diet achieved the total cholesterol goal of less than 150 and had no heart attacks or other heart-related problems during the 12 years. These data are particularly compelling considering that the same group had experienced more than 49 coronary events during the eight years before the study. 5  Scientists at the University of Washington conducted a study involving 202 people with a history of heart attacks. Half were given intensive dietary education (similar to the education received at the Pritikin Longevity Center). The remaining 101 patients received minimal education (one short visit from a dietitian). Six years later, the intensive education group had slashed the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and deaths, by two-thirds compared to the minimal care group. 6  Among 333 coronary artery disease patients , all of whom had been recommended for angioplasties or coronary bypass surgery, 194 elected to forgo the procedures and instead adopt lifestyle changes similar to the Pritikin Program. After three years, 77% in the lifestyle-change group had still avoided the surgeries. 7  Research funded by the U.S. Army followed 158 coronary patients with activity-limiting angina and 90 with mild angina. After three months of lifestyle intervention that included a predominately whole foods diet low in fat (10% of calories) and moderate exercise, 186 of the patients were angina-free and 23 reduced their angina from activity-limiting to mild. 8  Summed up Dr. Esselstyn in Preventive Cardiology : “Compelling data from nutritional studies, population surveys, and interventional studies support the effectiveness of a plant-based diet and aggressive lipid [cholesterol]-lowering to arrest, prevent, and selectively reverse heart disease. In essence, this is an offensive strategy.” 9 A diet like the Pritikin Eating Plan, based on fiber-rich plant foods, “can achieve total disease arrest and selective regression even in advanced cases,” concluded Dr. Esselstyn.    Why Heart Patients Do Well With Lifestyle Interventions Like the Pritikin Program  Research, as outlined above, demonstrates reversal (regression) of plaque build-up, but scientists are finding that many other biological benefits are also taking place. Here are three:   1. Improvement in the arteries’ ability to dilate, or open up  Using PET scans, scientists at UCLA measured blood flow in people before and after they began the Pritikin Program. The “after” scans showed an increase in the ability of the coronary circulation to vasodilate (open up) and increases in maximum coronary blood flow. 10  Similar results 11 have been reported for other patients following a very-low-fat diet and exercise intervention.  Metaphorically speaking, when your arterial “highways” are wide open, your blood cells have little problem delivering more oxygen to the heart.  Studies have also shown that one single high-fat meal has just the opposite effect on the arteries, namely, it causes constriction (vasoconstriction) and reduces maximum blood flow, like traffic that has slowed to nearly a standstill. 12    2. Reduced inflammation  Inflammation can be a very good thing. Think of inflammation like a burner on a gas stove. When you suffer an injury, like a cut on your finger, your body turns up the flame. Your immune system sends in an army of white blood cells that fight infection and promote healing. This is called local or acute inflammation.  But problems can occur for the arteries and heart when your body keeps that burner going.  This low, steady burn, known as chronic inflammation, is not caused by a single injury. Rather, it’s the result of constant injury to the inner walls of our arteries, and it’s brought on by excess LDL (bad) cholesterol and other lifestyle-related insults like high blood pressure, high blood glucose, and smoking.  Chronic inflammation leads to the formation of fatty streaks throughout our arteries, which can eventually lead to cholesterol-rich plaques.  Heart attack prevention is all about quelling these inflammatory flames. In several studies, the Pritikin Program has been proven to lower inflammatory markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, in men , 13  women , 14 and children . 15  Other markers of inflammation include noxious chemicals released by both white blood cells and fat cells. They’re called inflammatory cytokines. In recent research on overweight and normal-weight children at the Pritikin Longevity Center, scientists found that within two weeks, levels of inflammatory cytokines dropped markedly. 16  Similar results, published in studies over the past decade, have been observed in adults attending the Pritikin Program.    3. Reduction in risk of plaque rupture and blood clots  Plaque rupture occurs in what are known as vulnerable plaques – cholesterol-rich plaques with a high level of inflammation. The inflammation is thought to activate enzymes like matrix metallo proteinases.  These enzymes do a lot of dirty work. Like sandpaper rubbing on an inflamed boil, they degrade the fibrous cap covering the cholesterol plaque, making the cap vulnerable to cracking or rupture.  The Pritikin Program has been shown to reduce the level of one of the metalloproteinases (MMP-9), 17 which should immediately reduce the risk for plaque rupture, blood clot formation, and a heart attack.  If plaque does rupture, the plaque’s contents spew out into the bloodstream, triggering a swift gathering, or aggregation, of blood platelets. Plateletes are cells that circulate in the blood and clot to heal injuries. But clotting that occurs within our arterial pipelines can build to the point where it blocks blood flow. Research on Pritikin Program participants has shown a reduction in the tendency for platelets to aggregate and clots to form. 18   Summing Up… How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack  Act now.

Heart attacks aren't as deadly as they used to be. Thanks to advances in emergency treatment, hundreds of thousands of Americans who have had heart attacks survive the experience, some after more than one attack.  If you're one of those survivors, protecting your heart should be your top priority. One out of four men and one out of three women who live through an attack will die within the following year, most often of cardiac arrest or another heart attack, according to the American Heart Association. By making some healthy lifestyle changes and working closely with your doctor, you can remain a survivor -- not a victim.  What can I do to prevent a second heart attack?  Your risk for a second heart attack depends largely on your lifestyle. In other words, prevention is in your hands. Here's a look at the lifestyle changes that can help keep your heart in working order:  If you smoke, stop. Think of your first heart attack as a very serious wake-up call. Cigarettes damage your arteries, disrupt your heart's rhythm, and lower your HDL "good" cholesterol. You can cut your risk of another heart attack in half by giving up the habit. You should also avoid secondhand smoke at work and at home.  Eat a heart-healthy diet. Watching your diet, especially your fat intake, has never been more important. By cutting back on fats -- particularly saturated fat -- you can lower your LDL cholesterol, the artery-clogging substance that sets the stage for a heart attack.  According to the American Heart Association, heart attack survivors should get less than 30 percent of their calories from fat, and less than 7 percent from saturated fat (which is found in animal products). For a typical 2,000-calorie diet, this translates to less than 67 grams of fat (with less than 16 grams of that being saturated fat) every day.  Avoid trans fatty acids. These are found in some margarines, cookies, crackers, fries, donuts, and other snack foods. Some studies suggest that trans fats may actually increase cholesterol levels more than saturated fat! Check labels and avoid foods containing "partially hydrogenated oils" -- i.e., trans fat. You should also aim for less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol each day. To reach that goal, have no more than two egg yolks in your diet each week.  While you cut back on fatty foods, you can fill the void with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods will lower your blood pressure, control your cholesterol, and protect your arteries. For more information on a heart-healthy diet, see Warding Off Heart Disease Through Diet, Reversing Heart Disease Through Diet, and Watching Your Cholesterol. Some researchers, such as Dean Ornish, MD, have found that an extremely low-fat vegetarian diet has actually reversed heart disease by reducing the amount of blockage in the arteries.  Other researchers have found that taking "good fats" such as fish oil supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids -- which can help lower cholesterol -- is beneficial for the heart. You can also give your heart a boost by adding two fish meals to your diet each week. Cold water fish such as salmon and mackerel are especially rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Finally, substituting olive oil or canola oil for butter, margarine, and corn oil seems to have heart-protective effects as well.  Get regular exercise. Regular workouts strengthen your heart, lower your levels of LDL cholesterol, and boost levels of HDL cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol that helps keep your arteries clear. Exercise also helps ward off depression, a major threat to heart patients. All of this adds up to potent protection. A study published in the journal Circulation found that survivors who increased their activity levels were nearly twice as likely as inactive patients to still be alive seven years after the attack.  The American Heart Association recommends a minimum of 30 minutes of walking or other moderately vigorous exercise at least five times each week, or 20 minutes of vigorous exercise at least three times each week, supplemented by extra activity such as gardening and housework. Any activity is better than nothing. You can give your heart a boost simply by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or doing errands on foot instead of the car.  Not every heart can handle the rigors of exercise. You should have a thorough checkup before starting an exercise program. Your doctor may want to give you a stress test, an exam that monitors your heart while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bicycle. Many patients will be advised to participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program after their first heart attack. This program monitors your heart during exercise training to make sure it's safe to exercise.  Control your cholesterol. Government health experts recommend keeping your LDL ("bad") cholesterol under 100 milligrams per deciliter if you have heart disease or diabetes. however, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommends a different treatment option for those people who are at "very high risk" for a heart attack: taking statins or other drugs to get your LDL levels below 70 mg/dL. (You are considered very high risk if you have heart disease plus other risk factors like smoking or diabetes, or if you have been hospitalized for a heart attack.)  After lowering your LDL, your next most important goals are to keep your "good" HDL cholesterol above 40 mg/dL and your overall cholesterol under 200 mg/dL, according to the latest guidelines. (Women should actually keep their HDL cholesterol above 50 mg/dL, according to the American Heart Association.) An additional fat in the blood, triglycerides, ideally should be less than 150 mg/dL.  Watch your weight. Overweight people are especially vulnerable to heart trouble, including heart attacks. Ideally, your body mass index (BMI) should be between 18.5 and 24.9. (To calculate your BMI, see our BMI calculator.) A simpler alternative to the BMI, according to the American Heart Association, is to take your waist measurement. Men should keep theirs to 40 inches or less, women to 35 inches or less. If you're carrying some extra pounds, your doctor can help you set up an exercise and diet program. And even if you don't lose much weight, regular workouts and a low-fat diet will go a long way toward preventing another attack.  Reduce your stress. If you're feeling stressed, depressed, anxious, or angry, your emotional state may be damaging your heart. Many heart programs have shown that incorporating meditation or yoga to reduce stress helps damaged arteries. Developing better social support can also help (see Resurrection and After a Heart Attack: Reaching Out).  Follow a consistent care program. Taking your heart medications on schedule and booking regular doctor visits are also crucial, as is keeping your blood pressure under control. Your goal should be to keep your blood pressure under 140/90 (under 130/80 if you have kidney disease or are diabetic). Regular exercise and eating foods rich in potassium, especially bananas, has been shown to help keep blood pressure in check. If lifestyle changes fail to control your blood pressure, your doctor will likely recommend blood pressure medication.  What can my doctor do to help?  Preventing a second heart attack isn't just a one-person job. No matter how healthy your lifestyle, you'll need to work closely with your doctor to give your heart the best possible protection. In addition to providing valuable advice on diet and exercise, your doctor can prescribe medications to ward off another attack.  Here's a sampling of drugs that may be of help:  Beta blockers. Many heart attack survivors can benefit from these drugs (which include atenolol and metoprolol, among others). Beta blockers lower blood pressure, slow down the heart rate, and increase the heart's pumping power. In addition, beta blockers may prevent a sudden cardiac arrest. Ideally, patients should start taking the drugs within 24 hours of an attack and stay on them indefinitely. However, you shouldn't take beta blockers if you have uncontrolled heart failure, a dangerously slow heart beat, dangerously low blood pressure, or active reactive airway disease (asthma).  Cholesterol-lowering drugs. If regular exercise and a healthy diet aren't enough to bring your cholesterol levels under control, your doctor can prescribe medications to finish the job. As a general rule, any heart attack survivor with an LDL cholesterol level over 100 mg/dL will need drug treatment.  The 2004 NCEP guidelines recommend statins or other cholesterol-lowering drugs for people with an LDL level above 100 mg/dl who are at high risk for a heart attack. (You are at high risk if you have coronary heart disease, diabetes, or multiple risk factors like smoking and high blood pressure.)  If you are at very high risk for a heart attack (which means you have heart disease plus other risk factors like smoking or diabetes, or have been hospitalized for a heart attack), doctors may recommend that you use drug therapy to bring your LDL readings below 70 mg/dL.  The most effective cholesterol medications available today belong to a class called "statins." These drugs (including simvastatin and lovastatin) can dramatically lower cholesterol levels and come with few side effects, although some patients complain of constipation, stomach pains, and cramps. Recent studies of heart patients have found that statins can lower the risk of fatal heart complications by 20 to 42 percent.  Aspirin. By thinning the blood and preventing blood clots, this humble pain-reliever can make a big difference. In a study of nearly 20,000 heart attack survivors, a daily dose of aspirin cut the risk of a second heart attack by more than 30 percent.  Because regular doses of aspirin can cause stomach problems, you should talk to your doctor before starting an aspirin routine. For most people, a low-to-medium dose (75 to 160 milligrams per day, or the equivalent of one to two baby aspirins) of an enteric coated aspirin provides ample protection with relatively few side effects. In fact, a Duke University review published in 2008 found that a low dose of 50 mg was just as effective as a dose of 325 mg, but with less risk of stomach bleeding.

Syed W. Bokhari, MD on behalf of Riverside Community Hospital    Cardiology (Cardiovascular Disease)         If you've had one heart attack, it's likely you'll have another in the next five to 10 years. In this video, Syed Bokhari, MD, an interventional cardiologist at Riverside Community Hospital, says that this risk is even higher for women.                     Marco T. Bologna, MD on behalf of Baptist Health South Florida    Thoracic Surgery (Cardiothoracic Vascular)         The American Heart Association estimates approximately one million heart attacks occur in the United States every year, including 320,000 recurrent cases. After the first heart attack, patients face a “substantial” risk of another attack, heart failure, a stroke or sudden death, according to the heart association; 18% of men and about 35% of women will have a second heart attack within five years of the first attack.

Although some heart attacks are sudden and intense, most start slowly, with mild pain or discomfort. Pay attention to your body — and call 911 if you feel: Chest discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain.  Discomfort in other areas of the upper body. Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.  Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.  Other signs may include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness. Download our heart attack warning signs infographic.

But women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particularly shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and back or jaw pain . Learn about the warning signs of heart attack in women .  Act Fast Learn the signs, but remember this: Even if you're not sure it's a heart attack, have it checked out. Minutes matter! Fast action can save lives — maybe your own. Don't wait - call 911 or your emergency response number. Call 911 Calling 911 is almost always the fastest way to get lifesaving treatment.

      one. By taking action you can significantly reduce your chance for a second heart
      attack.  Risk factors  These factors increase your risk for another heart attack, according to experts:    Inactive lifestyle    Being overweight or obese    High cholesterol    High blood sugar, if you have diabetes    High blood pressure    Smoking    Excess stress    What you should do  The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends the following actions to reduce your
      risk for a second heart attack:     Quit smoking. You can cut your risk for another heart attack in half by not smoking. Talk to your
            healthcare provider about a smoking cessation program or nicotine replacement products.
            This is the biggest preventable risk factor for heart disease.    Eat a heart-healthy diet. By cutting back on saturated fat and trans fat, you can lower your LDL ("bad") cholesterol.
            This is one of the primary substances that causes heart attacks. Manufacturers are
            reducing or eliminating trans fats from their products. You can avoid most trans fatty
            acids, however, by eating less margarine and fewer cookies, crackers, fries, doughnuts,
            and other snack foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils. It's important to
            continue this eating pattern even when you eat out.    Control your cholesterol. Besides eating a heart-healthy diet, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop
            Hypertension) diet, you can help keep your cholesterol under control by exercising
            regularly. Your healthcare provider may also prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medicine,
            such as a statin. It's important to take this medicine as prescribed. Talk to your
            healthcare provider if you have any concerns.    Exercise regularly. Exercise is important because it strengthens your heart muscle. It also boosts your
            energy level and helps with weight management, cholesterol, and blood pressure. The
            AHA recommends a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of walking or other moderately vigorous
            exercise at least 3 to 5 times each week. If you've had a heart attack, you must get
            your healthcare provider's OK before starting an exercise program. If you have any
            of these symptoms during exercise, call your healthcare provider immediately:    Shortness of breath that lasts for more than 10 minutes    Chest pain or pain in your arms, neck, jaw, or stomach    Dizzy spells    Pale or splotchy skin    Very fast heartbeat or irregular heartbeat    Cold sweats    Nausea and vomiting    Weakness, swelling, or pain in your legs      Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight greatly increases your risk for a second heart attack. If you need
            to lose weight, ask your healthcare provider for help. Your BMI (body mass index)
            should be between 18.5 and 24.9. This is the healthiest range.    Control high blood pressure. Follow your healthcare provider's suggestions.    Assess your mental health. Depression, stress, anxiety, and anger can damage your heart and overall health. Talk
            with your healthcare provider about seeing a therapist if you need help with your
            emotions.    Take your medicines as directed. Your heart, cholesterol, and blood pressure medicines are an important part of your
            heart health. If you have any questions about them, talk with your healthcare provider
            or your pharmacist.

A stent is a small mesh tube that's used to treat narrow or weak arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from your heart to other parts of your body.  A stent is placed in an artery as part of a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty. PCI restores blood flow through narrow or blocked arteries. A stent helps support the inner wall of the artery in the months or years after PCI.  Doctors also may place stents in weak arteries to improve blood flow and help prevent the arteries from bursting.  Stents usually are made of metal mesh, but sometimes they're made of fabric. Fabric stents, also called stent grafts, are used in larger arteries.  Some stents are coated with medicine that is slowly and continuously released into the artery. These stents are called drug-eluting stents. The medicine helps prevent the artery from becoming blocked again.                     How Are Stents Used?                    For the Coronary Arteries Doctors may use stents to treat coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis . Plaque narrows the coronary arteries, reducing the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart. This can lead to chest pain or discomfort called angina . The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your coronary arteries. If blood clots block a coronary artery, a heart attack will occur. Doctors may use percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, and stents to treat CHD. During PCI, a thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrow or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery, which reduces angina and other CHD symptoms. Unless an artery is too small, a stent usually is placed in the treated portion of the artery during PCI. The stent supports the artery's inner wall. It also reduces the chance that the artery will become narrow or blocked again. A stent also can support an artery that was torn or injured during PCI. Even with a stent, there's about a 10–20 percent chance that an artery will become narrow or blocked again in the first year after PCI. When a stent isn't used, the risk can be as much as 10 times as high. Research has shown that as time goes by, people who have coronary artery stents are in less danger of risks from the surgery but more prone to the risks of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and renal failure. For the Carotid Arteries Doctors also may use stents to treat carotid artery disease . This is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that run along each side of your neck. These arteries, called carotid arteries, supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. The buildup of plaque in the carotid arteries limits blood flow to your brain and puts you at risk for a stroke . Doctors use stents to help support the carotid arteries after they're widened with PCI. Researchers continue to explore the risks and benefits of carotid artery stenting. For Other Arteries Plaque also can narrow other arteries, such as those in the kidneys and limbs. Narrow kidney arteries can affect kidney function and lead to severe high blood pressure . Narrow arteries in the limbs, a condition called peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.), can cause pain and cramping in the affected arm or leg. Severe narrowing can completely cut off blood flow to a limb, which could require surgery. To relieve these problems, doctors may do PCI on a narrow kidney, arm, or leg artery. They often will place a stent in the affected artery during the procedure. The stent helps support the artery and keep it open. For the Aorta in the Abdomen or Chest The aorta is a major artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left side of the heart to the body. This artery runs through the chest and down into the abdomen. Over time, some areas of the aorta's walls can weaken. These weak areas can cause a bulge in the artery called an aneurysm . An aneurysm in the aorta can burst, leading to serious internal bleeding. When aneurysms occur, they're usually in the abdominal aorta. To help avoid a burst, doctors may place a fabric stent in the weak area of the abdominal aorta. The stent creates a stronger inner lining for the artery. Aneurysms also can develop in the part of the aorta that runs through the chest. Doctors also use stents to treat these aneurysms. How well the stents work over the long term still isn't known. To Close Off Aortic Tears Another problem that can occur in the aorta is a tear in its inner wall. If blood is forced into the tear, it will widen. The tear can reduce blood flow to the tissues that the aorta serves. Over time, the tear can block blood flow through the artery or burst. If this happens, it usually occurs in the chest portion of the aorta. Researchers are developing and testing new kinds of stents that will prevent blood from flowing into aortic tears. A stent placed within the torn area of the aorta might help restore normal blood flow and reduce the risk of a burst aorta.                     How Are Stents Placed?                    Doctors place stents in arteries as part of a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty. To place a stent, your doctor will make a small opening in a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh), arm, or neck.  Through this opening, your doctor will thread a thin, flexible tube called a catheter. The catheter will have a deflated balloon at its tip.  A stent is placed around the deflated balloon. Your doctor will move the tip of the catheter to the narrow section of the artery or to the aneurysm or aortic tear site.  Special x-ray movies will be taken of the tube as it's threaded through your blood vessel. These movies will help your doctor position the catheter.  For Arteries Narrowed by Plaque  Your doctor will use special dye to help show narrow or blocked areas in the artery. He or she will then move the catheter to the area and inflate the balloon.  As the balloon inflates, it pushes the plaque against the artery wall. This widens the artery and helps restore blood flow. The fully extended balloon also expands the stent, pushing it into place in the artery.  The balloon is deflated and pulled out along with the catheter. The stent remains in your artery. Over time, cells in your artery grow to cover the mesh of the stent. They create an inner layer that looks like the inside of a normal blood vessel.  Coronary Artery Stent Placement      Figure A shows the location of the heart and coronary arteries. Figure B shows the deflated balloon catheter and closed stent inserted into the narrow coronary artery. The inset image shows a cross-section of the artery with the inserted balloon catheter and closed stent. In figure C, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent and compressing the plaque against the artery wall. Figure D shows the stent-widened artery. The inset image shows a cross-section of the compressed plaque and stent-widened artery.   A very narrow artery, or one that's hard to reach with a catheter, may require more steps to place a stent. At first, your doctor may use a small balloon to expand the artery. He or she then removes the balloon.  The small balloon is replaced with a larger balloon that has a collapsed stent around it. At this point, your doctor can follow the standard process of compressing the plaque and placing the stent.  Doctors use a special filter device when doing PCI and stent placement on the carotid arteries. The filter helps keep blood clots and loose pieces of plaque from traveling to the brain during the procedure.  For Aortic Aneurysms  The procedure to place a stent in an artery with an aneurysm is very similar to the one described above. However, the stent used to treat an aneurysm is different. It's made out of pleated fabric instead of metal mesh, and it often has one or more tiny hooks.  The stent is expanded to fit tight against the artery wall. The hooks latch on to the wall of the artery, holding the stent in place.  The stent creates a new inner lining for that portion of the artery. Over time, cells in the artery grow to cover the fabric. They create an inner layer that looks like the inside of a normal blood vessel.                     What To Expect Before a Stent Procedure                    Most stent procedures require an overnight stay in a hospital and someone to take you home. Talk with your doctor about:  When to stop eating and drinking before coming to the hospital  What medicines you should or shouldn't take on the day of the procedure  When to come to the hospital and where to go  If you have diabetes, kidney disease, or other conditions, ask your doctor whether you need to take any extra steps during or after the procedure to avoid complications.  Before the procedure, your doctor may talk to you about medicines you'll likely need to take after the stent is placed. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the stent.  You'll need to know how long you should take these medicines and why they're important. For more information about these medicines, go to "What To Expect After a Stent Procedure."                     What To Expect During a Stent Procedure                    For Arteries Narrowed by Plaque This procedure usually takes about an hour. It might take longer if stents are inserted into more than one artery during the procedure. Before the procedure starts, you'll get medicine to help you relax. You'll be on your back and awake during the procedure. This allows you to follow your doctor's instructions. Your doctor will numb the area where the catheter will be inserted. You won't feel the doctor threading the catheter, balloon, or stent inside the artery. You may feel some pain when the balloon is expanded to push the stent into place. For Aortic Aneurysms Although this procedure takes only a few hours, it often requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Before the procedure, you'll be given medicine to help you relax. If your doctor is placing the stent in your abdominal aorta, you may receive medicine to numb your stomach area. However, you'll be awake during the procedure. If your doctor is placing the stent in the chest portion of your aorta, you'll likely receive medicine to make you sleep during the procedure. Once you're numb or asleep, your doctor will make a small cut in your groin (upper thigh). He or she will insert a catheter into the blood vessel through this cut. Sometimes two cuts (one in the groin area of each leg) are needed to place fabric stents that come in two parts. You will not feel the doctor threading the catheter, balloon, or stent into the artery.                     What To Expect After a Stent Procedure                    Recovery  After either type of stent procedure (for arteries narrowed by plaque or aortic aneurysms), your doctor will remove the catheter from your artery. The site where the catheter was inserted will be bandaged.  A small sandbag or other type of weight may be put on top of the bandage to apply pressure and help prevent bleeding. You'll recover in a special care area, where your movement will be limited.  While you're in recovery, a nurse will check your heart rate and blood pressure regularly. The nurse also will look to see whether you're bleeding from the insertion site.  Eventually, a small bruise and sometimes a small, hard "knot" will appear at the insertion site. This area may feel sore or tender for about a week.  You should let your doctor know if:  You have a constant or large amount of bleeding at the insertion site that can't be stopped with a small bandage  You have any unusual pain, swelling, redness, or other signs of infection at or near the insertion site  Common Precautions After a Stent Procedure  Blood Clotting Precautions  After a stent procedure, your doctor will likely recommend that you take aspirin and another anticlotting medicine. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the stent. A blood clot can lead to a heart attack , stroke , or other serious problems.  If you have a metal stent, your doctor may recommend aspirin and another anticlotting medicine for at least 1 month. If your stent is coated with medicine, your doctor may recommend aspirin and another anticlotting medicine for 12 months or more. Your doctor will work with you to decide the best course of treatment.  Your risk of blood clots significantly increases if you stop taking the anticlotting medicine too early. Taking these medicines for as long as your doctor recommends is important. He or she may recommend lifelong treatment with aspirin.  If you're considering surgery for some other reason while you're on these medicines, talk to your doctor about whether it can wait until after you've stopped the medicine. Anticlotting medicines may increase the risk of bleeding.  Also, anticlotting medicines can cause side effects, such as an allergic rash. Talk to your doctor about how to reduce the risk of these side effects.  Other Precautions  You should avoid vigorous exercise and heavy lifting for a short time after the stent procedure. Your doctor will let you know when you can go back to your normal activities.  Metal detectors used in airports and other screening areas don't affect stents. Your stent shouldn't cause metal detectors to go off.  If you have an aortic fabric stent, your doctor will likely recommend followup imaging tests (for example, chest x ray ) within the first year of having the procedure. After the first year, he or she may recommend yearly imaging tests.  Lifestyle Changes  Stents help prevent arteries from becoming narrow or blocked again in the months or years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty. However, stents aren't a cure for atherosclerosis or its risk factors.  Making lifestyle changes can help prevent plaque from building up in your arteries again. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for atherosclerosis and the lifestyle changes you'll need to make.  Lifestyle changes may include changing your diet, quitting smoking , being physically active , losing weight , and reducing stress . You also should take all medicines as your doctor prescribes. Your doctor may suggest taking statins, which are medicines that lower blood cholesterol levels.  For more information about lifestyle changes, go to the treatment section of the Health Topics Atherosclerosis article.                     What Are the Risks of Having a Stent?                    Risks Related to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the procedure used to place stents, is a medical procedure that is commonly known as coronary angioplasty. PCI carries a small risk of serious complications, such as:  Bleeding from the site where the catheter was inserted into the skin  Damage to the blood vessel from the catheter  Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)  Damage to the kidneys caused by the dye used during the procedure  An allergic reaction to the dye used during the procedure  Infection  Another problem that can occur after PCI is too much tissue growth within the treated portion of the artery. This can cause the artery to become narrow or blocked again. When this happens, it's called restenosis (RE-sten-no-sis).  Using drug-eluting stents can help prevent this problem. These stents are coated with medicine to stop excess tissue growth.  Treating the tissue around the stent with radiation also can delay tissue growth. For this procedure, the doctor threads a wire through a catheter to the stent. The wire releases radiation and stops cells around the stent from growing and blocking the artery.  Restenosis of a Stent-Widened Coronary Artery      Figure A shows the coronary arteries located on the surface of the heart. Figure B shows a stent-widened artery with normal blood flow. The inset image shows a cross-section of the stent-widened artery. In figure C, tissue grows through and around the stent over time. This causes a partial blockage of the artery and abnormal blood flow. The inset image shows a cross-section of the tissue growth around the stent.   Figure A shows the coronary arteries located on the surface of the heart. Figure B shows a stent-widened artery with normal blood flow. The inset image shows a cross-section of the stent-widened artery. In figure C, tissue grows through and around the stent over time. This causes a partial blockage of the artery and abnormal blood flow. The inset image shows a cross-section of the tissue growth around the stent.  Risks Related to Stents  About 1–2 percent of people who have stented arteries develop a blood clot at the stent site. Blood clots can cause a heart attack , stroke , or other serious problems. The risk of blood clots is greatest during the first few months after the stent is placed in the artery.  Your doctor will likely recommend that you take aspirin and another anticlotting medicine, such as clopidogrel, for at least 1 month or up to a year or more after having a stent procedure. These medicines help prevent blood clots.  The length of time you need to take anticlotting medicines depends on the type of stent you have. Your doctor may recommend lifelong treatment with aspirin.  Stents coated with medicine may raise your risk of dangerous blood clots. (These stents often are used to keep clogged heart arteries open.) However, research hasn't proven that these stents increase the chances of having a heart attack or dying, if used as recommended.  Risks Related to Aortic Stents in the Abdomen  Although rare, a few serious problems can occur when surgery or a fabric stent is used to repair an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta. These problems include:  A burst artery (aneurysm rupture).  Blocked blood flow to the stomach or lower body.  Paralysis in the legs due to interruption of blood flow to the spinal cord. This problem is very rare.  Another possible problem is the fabric stent moving further down the aorta. This sometimes happens years after the stent is first placed. The stent movement may require a doctor to place another fabric stent in the area of the aneurysm.

Risk for Repeat Heart Attacks   By MELISSA SCHORR  B O S T O N, Sept. 27   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The good news: You’ve just survived a heart attack. The bad news: Your heart troubles could get worse, if your attack was caused by one of several “vulnerable plaques” — tiny, inflamed buildups of fat that burst and plug up blood vessels — any of which could be a ticking time bomb for another attack. Doctors have come to believe as many as two-thirds of all heart attacks are caused by these vulnerable plaques brewing on blood vessel walls, which become inflamed and suddenly rupture for undetermined reasons. The other third are due to fatty blockages, or clogged arteries, and rarely, vessel spasms. A new study being published in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine lends further credence to the theory that plaques in several locations throughout the heart’s vessels increase the likelihood of further heart disruptions. Tip of the Iceberg
“When you have a heart attack, the area that emerges is the tip of the iceberg,” explains the study’s lead author, James A. Goldstein, a cardiologist at the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. “There is corrosion in the pipes throughout the house.” In the study, Goldstein and his colleagues examined the angiograms, or the X-ray images of the heart’s blood vessels, from 253 heart attack patients and found that 40 percent of them had several remaining unstable plaques throughout the vessels in their hearts. Those patients with the multiple plaques, he found, were more likely to be repeat offenders for heart attack within the year. They were also more likely to develop symptoms that require repeated repeat angioplasty or bypass surgery, he says. Goldstein says these findings may suggest a new treatment style for heart attack patients, including taking megadoses of cholesterol-lowering drugs and anti-inflamatory medications immediately after the attack to stabilize the remaining plaques, as well as interventional surgery on the plaques that look especially “nasty” and rupture-prone.  Treatment Unclear
But experts say they have yet to determine the best way to treat these vulnerable plaques to prevent them from doing damage. This month, cardiologists met at a conference held in New York City to discuss the best ways to identify and treat plaques. “At this point, we’re not certain of the right treatment — aggressive lipid-lowering or addressing these lesions specifically,” says Dr. Sergio Waxman, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, who presented research at the meeting. “There are some data that suggest that being more aggressive is associated with more benefit.” Waxman adds it may be cheaper to treat the patient with drug interventions than performing costly surgery on each lesion, such as implanting a stent, a wire mesh placed in the blood vessel to hold back any obstruction. Others doctors are exploring different potential methods of treating the plaques, such as using heat or gene therapy, says Dr. James Willerson, medical director of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston. The important message from this study is that heart attack victims need to remain on top of their treatment, says Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston.
.
“The perception is that you have an aggressive treatment for a heart attack, you go home and you’re fixed,” Cannon says. “This is a pretty strong reminder that isn’t always the case — there are other lesions that can cause problems. You really have to follow through with your treatment.” Plaque Prevention
The findings may also have implications for those who have not suffered a heart attack, but are concerned about their future heart health. In addition to an angiogram, a simple blood test that measures something called C-reactive protein and amyloid protein can be performed to test whether inflammation is present in the body, indicating these vulnerable plaques are present, says study author Goldstein. But the test is not yet widely available.  The plaques also can be aggressively treated with cholesterol-lowering medications, which have been shown to lessen a chance of a rupture by somehow stabilizing the plaques, says Dr. James Januzzi a cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a member of their Vulnerable Plaque Project. Unfortunately, there is still no way to accurate predict which plaque will go on to rupture and cause a heart attack. “That’s the million-dollar question,” sighs Januzzi. “This doesn’t solve that problem — but it adds all sorts of enthusiasm towards finding a technology that can.”        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Afterward, he went back to his high-stress job at a financial services company. That night, he ended up in the emergency room - thanks to his anxious wife who took him there - after he'd felt pain and a weight "like an elephant sitting on my chest." Steve had had a myocardial infarction (MI), more commonly known as a heart attack. For him and his family, it was a major wake-up call. With one child in high school and another in college, a mortgage, and elderly parents to worry about, Steve couldn't afford to be sick. He also couldn't afford to go on living the way he had been. Like many baby boomers, Steve thought he would stay young forever. But a lifetime of less-than-healthy eating, diminishing physical activity, and workplace stress - not to mention some predispositions inherited from his father - had caught up with him. Steve's not alone. Dr. Fred Leya, director of interventional cardiology at the Loyola University Health System in Chicago, one of the top-ranked U.S. heart hospitals, says that baby boomers are entering a higher-risk period for heart attack. Men enter this period in their late 40s; women, in their mid-50s. "Baby boomers need to focus carefully on the state of their health, including lifetime cardiovascular risk control," says Leya. "Genetics, on top of smoking , diabetes , high blood pressure, lack of exercise, and other cardiovascular risk factors, plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries." To reduce the risk of heart attack, boomers should learn their risk factors and control them. "Know your numbers - the good and bad cholesterol, HDL and LDL; blood pressure; heart rate; glucose - and check them annually," says Leya. After evaluation and treatment, Steve underwent an angioplasty and received a stent - a small stainless-steel scaffold to keep blood vessels open and maintain blood flow to the heart. He was sent home with a list of admonitions from his doctor, who also enlisted Steve's family in helping him get better and stay better. Although each patient is different, and each situation may call for variations in approach, according to the American Heart Association, patients routinely feel worried and upset after a heart attack. A heart attack is an emotional as well as a physical event, and the emotions affect everyone in the family. Caregivers should encourage heart attack survivors to talk about their feelings of fear, anxiety, irritation, depression, and anger. Remember that these are normal and usually disappear on their own - within two to six months after the event. However, caregivers should watch for signs of serious depression . Some studies have shown that serious depression heightens the risk of a second heart attack. If you think the person you are caring for is seriously depressed, consult a professional. If you are caring for someone who is recovering from a heart attack, there are several areas of concern you should familiarize yourself with. The following information will help you help the patient - you'll feel more in control and able to manage your own feelings of anxiety. What about pain? You - and the person you're caring for - will probably wonder if chest pain is normal after a heart attack. Not all heart attack survivors experience it, but some do feel light pain or pressure in the chest (angina pectoris) during or right after physical exertion, after a heavy meal, or when feeling powerful emotions. Keep the doctor apprised of this pain and how it progresses - treatment is available. It's especially important to contact a doctor if angina gets worse over time. What about work? A heart attack doesn't have to end a career. Most people go back to work anywhere from two weeks to three months after having a heart attack, but some may need to make adjustments in the type of work they do and the amount of stress or physical demand their job entails. What about driving? Most people who have had a heart attack without complications can resume driving within a week, provided they follow state law. Some states have special restrictions for people recovering from serious illness, such as not driving alone or not driving at night. Commercial drivers must wait two months and be recertified before they can go back to work. What about sex? Most people can return to their usual pattern of sexual activity after they recover from a heart attack. According to the American Heart Association, a patient should be ready to have sex once he or she is able to walk around easily. If chest pain occurs during sex, you and your loved one can talk to a doctor about treatment. What about exercise? It's likely that a heart attack patient will need more physical activity than before the attack, but it's important to exercise safely. Consider a cardiac rehabilitation program at a hospital or clinic in your area. In these programs, physical activity is designed specifically for heart health and is closely monitored. What about rest? Getting a good night's rest is important for heart attack patients. A nap or short rest during the day is a good idea, too. Heart patients should always rest before they get too tired. And why not take a cue from new parents: Use naptime to grab a few winks yourself! You, too, are under strain during this recovery period. What if there's another heart attack? Know the warning signs of a heart attack and act fast when you see them. The signs and symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, indigestion, nausea, and pain in the back, neck, or jaw. Someone in your family might want to take a CPR course - not only to be prepared but also to learn more about how to recognize a heart attack if it happens. What About the Future? Many, many people recover fully from their heart attacks and go on to lead long, healthier lives. You can help the person you are caring for do that by making sure that he or she follows the ABCs of prevention: Avoid tobacco. Smoking after a heart attack doubles your chances of having a second one, according to the American Heart Association. Become more active. Regular exercise or activity at a cardiac rehabilitation program can make a significant difference. Physical activity eases stress and depression, helps control weight, and can lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Choose good nutrition. Healthful eating will help control weight, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and help the body heal faster. This is good advice for everyone in the family - not just the heart attack survivor.

It’s an experience you don’t want to repeat, ever.    From the Pritikin Longevity Center, learn in this article how to prevent a second heart attack. And start a new life, a better life. For the last four decades, Pritikin's renowned experts have helped thousands worldwide. The success of Pritikin's heart-healthy lifestyle is proven in 100+ studies.         Decreasing heart attack risk depends largely on your lifestyle. Healthy changes in the way you live, particularly diet and exercise, have been proven to dramatically reduce major risk factors.   How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack  To understand how to prevent a second heart attack, it’s important to understand why the first heart attack likely occurred, and what heart disease is.  It’s also important to understand that you’re not alone.  Heart disease is the #1 killer in the U.S. of both men and women. The Centers for Disease Control has estimated that someone in America is having a heart attack every 34 seconds. Every 60 seconds someone is dying from a heart disease-related event.  What Is Heart Disease?  Most heart disease results from an inflammatory process within the arteries called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis injures and clogs arteries, and it can develop in any artery of the body.  Preventing a second heart attack means preventing plaque growth.  Plaque  The material inside the arteries causing the blockage is commonly referred to as plaque. Plaque causes the inner walls of the arteries to balloon and swell to accommodate the space that plaque occupies. The process becomes critical when small blood clots form near the plaque, which can completely choke blood flow to vital organs.  In most cases, it is the sudden rupture of the weakened area (plaque) that triggers blood clots and stops blood flow, causing an interruption in the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the involved organ (heart, brain, etc.). Depending upon which cells and tissues die, the result could be a heart attack, stroke, or other circulatory problem.  Heart Disease Risk Factors  Plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries for many reasons. Here are four key risk factors:    High forms of bad cholesterol, such as LDL and non-HDL The higher the bad cholesterol concentration in your blood, the more plaque you are likely to have, and the more damaged your artery walls become.  High glucose (blood sugar)  Hypertension (high blood pressure)  Smoking    How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack  Decreasing heart attack risk depends largely on your lifestyle. Healthy changes in the way you live, particularly diet and exercise, have been proven to:    Dramatically reduce heart disease risk factors like high LDL and non-HDL cholesterol, high glucose, and hypertension  Stabilize plaques  Slow down, and even reverse the progression of coronary heart disease.    Diet – The Most Significant Lifestyle-Related Factor  Reducing saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol in your diet will help prevent a second heart attack.  A large body of research (detailed later in this article) has found that the following dietary characteristics, all part of the Pritikin Eating Plan , are effective in reducing bad cholesterol and other risk factors, and reverses the progression of heart disease:    Reduce saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol in the diet.  Foods rich in saturated fats include red meats, processed meats like bacon and bologna, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and fatty dairy foods like cheese, ice cream, butter, and whole milk.  Foods high in trans fats are often margarines, fries, donuts, cookies, crackers, and other snack foods. Avoid foods containing partially hydrogenated oil – i.e., trans fat.  Foods especially high in dietary cholesterol are egg yolks and organ meats.   Increase fiber in the form of whole, nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans.     Other Key Lifestyle-Related Measures To Prevent Heart Attacks Include:    Smoking cessation  Blood pressure control  Physical activity  Weight management , particularly reductions in abdominal (belly) fat  Blood sugar control  Stress management      Medical Care How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack   No matter how healthy your lifestyle, it’s vital to consult regularly with your cardiologist to give your heart optimal protection. Physician-supervised care, states the National, Heart, and Blood Institute , should involve not only lifestyle-change education but also:   Medicines, if needed, to control chest pain or discomfort, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and your heart’s workload  A cardiac rehabilitation program    A new Medicare-approved form of cardiac rehabilitation, called intensive cardiac rehabilitation (ICR), is now being conducted at the Pritikin Longevity Center .  Medicare May Partially Cover Your Stay At Pritikin Did you know that M​edicare coverage is now accepted at the Pritikin Longevity Center for qualifying individuals? Find Out If You Qualify  Like traditional cardiac rehab (CR) programs, Pritikin’s ICR program focuses on exercise. But it also provides comprehensive education in all the key skills that foster a healthy lifestyle, including food shopping, cooking, dining out, smoking cessation, and reducing the stress in your life.   What Science Says How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack   Below is a summary of key research over the last three decades on the benefits of lifestyle interventions for the heart:  The Intensive Cardiac Rehab program at the Pritikin Center in Miami, Florida, is lauded by many as the best available. Oprah.com called Pritikin “the gold standard.” The New York Times described Pritikin as the “the granddaddy of health-based wellness spas.” If you’ve had a heart attack, your life-transforming vacation at the Pritikin Center may be covered in part by Medicare.    Sixty-four patients with coronary artery disease were recommended by their cardiologists to have bypass surgery. Instead, they chose to attend the Pritikin Longevity Center. In the follow-up study conducted five years after the patients had left Pritikin, researchers at UCLA reported that 80% of the patients had never needed bypass surgery. In addition, 68% of those who had suffered from angina (chest pain) before coming to Pritikin reported being completely free of angina. 1  Scientists at University of Southern California showed that a combination of drugs and diet decreased plaque lesions in the arteries of humans. 2  Researchers at University of California, San Francisco, showed that lifestyle changes – a low-fat, fiber-rich diet, regular exercise, and stress management – caused shrinking of plaque in most people with atherosclerosis, and without the need for any heart or cholesterol-reducing medications. 3  The Stanford Coronary Risk Intervention Project followed 300 people with coronary artery disease for four years. Half were assigned to usual care (no lifestyle intervention), and half received intensive lifestyle education in dietary change, exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management. The best predictor of new coronary blockages was dietary fat intake. As fat intake rose, the number of coronary blockages rose. Those patients with the lowest intake of dietary fat (about 10% to 15%, like the Pritikin Eating Plan) had the greatest amount of plaque shrinkage, or regression. 4  Caldwell B. Esselstyn, Jr., MD, at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation found that a plant-based diet in conjunction with cholesterol-reducing medication reversed heart disease in 70% of patients over a 12-year period. All patients who maintained the diet achieved the total cholesterol goal of less than 150 and had no heart attacks or other heart-related problems during the 12 years. These data are particularly compelling considering that the same group had experienced more than 49 coronary events during the eight years before the study. 5  Scientists at the University of Washington conducted a study involving 202 people with a history of heart attacks. Half were given intensive dietary education (similar to the education received at the Pritikin Longevity Center). The remaining 101 patients received minimal education (one short visit from a dietitian). Six years later, the intensive education group had slashed the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and deaths, by two-thirds compared to the minimal care group. 6  Among 333 coronary artery disease patients , all of whom had been recommended for angioplasties or coronary bypass surgery, 194 elected to forgo the procedures and instead adopt lifestyle changes similar to the Pritikin Program. After three years, 77% in the lifestyle-change group had still avoided the surgeries. 7  Research funded by the U.S. Army followed 158 coronary patients with activity-limiting angina and 90 with mild angina. After three months of lifestyle intervention that included a predominately whole foods diet low in fat (10% of calories) and moderate exercise, 186 of the patients were angina-free and 23 reduced their angina from activity-limiting to mild. 8  Summed up Dr. Esselstyn in Preventive Cardiology : “Compelling data from nutritional studies, population surveys, and interventional studies support the effectiveness of a plant-based diet and aggressive lipid [cholesterol]-lowering to arrest, prevent, and selectively reverse heart disease. In essence, this is an offensive strategy.” 9 A diet like the Pritikin Eating Plan, based on fiber-rich plant foods, “can achieve total disease arrest and selective regression even in advanced cases,” concluded Dr. Esselstyn.    Why Heart Patients Do Well With Lifestyle Interventions Like the Pritikin Program  Research, as outlined above, demonstrates reversal (regression) of plaque build-up, but scientists are finding that many other biological benefits are also taking place. Here are three:   1. Improvement in the arteries’ ability to dilate, or open up  Using PET scans, scientists at UCLA measured blood flow in people before and after they began the Pritikin Program. The “after” scans showed an increase in the ability of the coronary circulation to vasodilate (open up) and increases in maximum coronary blood flow. 10  Similar results 11 have been reported for other patients following a very-low-fat diet and exercise intervention.  Metaphorically speaking, when your arterial “highways” are wide open, your blood cells have little problem delivering more oxygen to the heart.  Studies have also shown that one single high-fat meal has just the opposite effect on the arteries, namely, it causes constriction (vasoconstriction) and reduces maximum blood flow, like traffic that has slowed to nearly a standstill. 12    2. Reduced inflammation  Inflammation can be a very good thing. Think of inflammation like a burner on a gas stove. When you suffer an injury, like a cut on your finger, your body turns up the flame. Your immune system sends in an army of white blood cells that fight infection and promote healing. This is called local or acute inflammation.  But problems can occur for the arteries and heart when your body keeps that burner going.  This low, steady burn, known as chronic inflammation, is not caused by a single injury. Rather, it’s the result of constant injury to the inner walls of our arteries, and it’s brought on by excess LDL (bad) cholesterol and other lifestyle-related insults like high blood pressure, high blood glucose, and smoking.  Chronic inflammation leads to the formation of fatty streaks throughout our arteries, which can eventually lead to cholesterol-rich plaques.  Heart attack prevention is all about quelling these inflammatory flames. In several studies, the Pritikin Program has been proven to lower inflammatory markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, in men , 13  women , 14 and children . 15  Other markers of inflammation include noxious chemicals released by both white blood cells and fat cells. They’re called inflammatory cytokines. In recent research on overweight and normal-weight children at the Pritikin Longevity Center, scientists found that within two weeks, levels of inflammatory cytokines dropped markedly. 16  Similar results, published in studies over the past decade, have been observed in adults attending the Pritikin Program.    3. Reduction in risk of plaque rupture and blood clots  Plaque rupture occurs in what are known as vulnerable plaques – cholesterol-rich plaques with a high level of inflammation. The inflammation is thought to activate enzymes like matrix metallo proteinases.  These enzymes do a lot of dirty work. Like sandpaper rubbing on an inflamed boil, they degrade the fibrous cap covering the cholesterol plaque, making the cap vulnerable to cracking or rupture.  The Pritikin Program has been shown to reduce the level of one of the metalloproteinases (MMP-9), 17 which should immediately reduce the risk for plaque rupture, blood clot formation, and a heart attack.  If plaque does rupture, the plaque’s contents spew out into the bloodstream, triggering a swift gathering, or aggregation, of blood platelets. Plateletes are cells that circulate in the blood and clot to heal injuries. But clotting that occurs within our arterial pipelines can build to the point where it blocks blood flow. Research on Pritikin Program participants has shown a reduction in the tendency for platelets to aggregate and clots to form. 18   Summing Up… How To Prevent a Second Heart Attack  Act now. It could save your life.

Heart attacks aren't as deadly as they used to be. Thanks to advances in emergency treatment, hundreds of thousands of Americans who have had heart attacks survive the experience, some after more than one attack.  If you're one of those survivors, protecting your heart should be your top priority. One out of four men and one out of three women who live through an attack will die within the following year, most often of cardiac arrest or another heart attack, according to the American Heart Association. By making some healthy lifestyle changes and working closely with your doctor, you can remain a survivor -- not a victim.  What can I do to prevent a second heart attack?  Your risk for a second heart attack depends largely on your lifestyle. In other words, prevention is in your hands. Here's a look at the lifestyle changes that can help keep your heart in working order:  If you smoke, stop. Think of your first heart attack as a very serious wake-up call. Cigarettes damage your arteries, disrupt your heart's rhythm, and lower your HDL "good" cholesterol. You can cut your risk of another heart attack in half by giving up the habit. You should also avoid secondhand smoke at work and at home.  Eat a heart-healthy diet. Watching your diet, especially your fat intake, has never been more important. By cutting back on fats -- particularly saturated fat -- you can lower your LDL cholesterol, the artery-clogging substance that sets the stage for a heart attack.  According to the American Heart Association, heart attack survivors should get less than 30 percent of their calories from fat, and less than 7 percent from saturated fat (which is found in animal products). For a typical 2,000-calorie diet, this translates to less than 67 grams of fat (with less than 16 grams of that being saturated fat) every day.  Avoid trans fatty acids. These are found in some margarines, cookies, crackers, fries, donuts, and other snack foods. Some studies suggest that trans fats may actually increase cholesterol levels more than saturated fat! Check labels and avoid foods containing "partially hydrogenated oils" -- i.e., trans fat. You should also aim for less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol each day. To reach that goal, have no more than two egg yolks in your diet each week.  While you cut back on fatty foods, you can fill the void with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods will lower your blood pressure, control your cholesterol, and protect your arteries. For more information on a heart-healthy diet, see Warding Off Heart Disease Through Diet, Reversing Heart Disease Through Diet, and Watching Your Cholesterol. Some researchers, such as Dean Ornish, MD, have found that an extremely low-fat vegetarian diet has actually reversed heart disease by reducing the amount of blockage in the arteries.  Other researchers have found that taking "good fats" such as fish oil supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids -- which can help lower cholesterol -- is beneficial for the heart. You can also give your heart a boost by adding two fish meals to your diet each week. Cold water fish such as salmon and mackerel are especially rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Finally, substituting olive oil or canola oil for butter, margarine, and corn oil seems to have heart-protective effects as well.  Get regular exercise. Regular workouts strengthen your heart, lower your levels of LDL cholesterol, and boost levels of HDL cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol that helps keep your arteries clear. Exercise also helps ward off depression, a major threat to heart patients. All of this adds up to potent protection. A study published in the journal Circulation found that survivors who increased their activity levels were nearly twice as likely as inactive patients to still be alive seven years after the attack.  The American Heart Association recommends a minimum of 30 minutes of walking or other moderately vigorous exercise at least five times each week, or 20 minutes of vigorous exercise at least three times each week, supplemented by extra activity such as gardening and housework. Any activity is better than nothing. You can give your heart a boost simply by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or doing errands on foot instead of the car.  Not every heart can handle the rigors of exercise. You should have a thorough checkup before starting an exercise program. Your doctor may want to give you a stress test, an exam that monitors your heart while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bicycle. Many patients will be advised to participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program after their first heart attack. This program monitors your heart during exercise training to make sure it's safe to exercise.  Control your cholesterol. Government health experts recommend keeping your LDL ("bad") cholesterol under 100 milligrams per deciliter if you have heart disease or diabetes. however, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommends a different treatment option for those people who are at "very high risk" for a heart attack: taking statins or other drugs to get your LDL levels below 70 mg/dL. (You are considered very high risk if you have heart disease plus other risk factors like smoking or diabetes, or if you have been hospitalized for a heart attack.)  After lowering your LDL, your next most important goals are to keep your "good" HDL cholesterol above 40 mg/dL and your overall cholesterol under 200 mg/dL, according to the latest guidelines. (Women should actually keep their HDL cholesterol above 50 mg/dL, according to the American Heart Association.) An additional fat in the blood, triglycerides, ideally should be less than 150 mg/dL.  Watch your weight. Overweight people are especially vulnerable to heart trouble, including heart attacks. Ideally, your body mass index (BMI) should be between 18.5 and 24.9. (To calculate your BMI, see our BMI calculator.) A simpler alternative to the BMI, according to the American Heart Association, is to take your waist measurement. Men should keep theirs to 40 inches or less, women to 35 inches or less. If you're carrying some extra pounds, your doctor can help you set up an exercise and diet program. And even if you don't lose much weight, regular workouts and a low-fat diet will go a long way toward preventing another attack.  Reduce your stress. If you're feeling stressed, depressed, anxious, or angry, your emotional state may be damaging your heart. Many heart programs have shown that incorporating meditation or yoga to reduce stress helps damaged arteries. Developing better social support can also help (see Resurrection and After a Heart Attack: Reaching Out).  Follow a consistent care program. Taking your heart medications on schedule and booking regular doctor visits are also crucial, as is keeping your blood pressure under control. Your goal should be to keep your blood pressure under 140/90 (under 130/80 if you have kidney disease or are diabetic). Regular exercise and eating foods rich in potassium, especially bananas, has been shown to help keep blood pressure in check. If lifestyle changes fail to control your blood pressure, your doctor will likely recommend blood pressure medication.  What can my doctor do to help?  Preventing a second heart attack isn't just a one-person job. No matter how healthy your lifestyle, you'll need to work closely with your doctor to give your heart the best possible protection. In addition to providing valuable advice on diet and exercise, your doctor can prescribe medications to ward off another attack.  Here's a sampling of drugs that may be of help:  Beta blockers. Many heart attack survivors can benefit from these drugs (which include atenolol and metoprolol, among others). Beta blockers lower blood pressure, slow down the heart rate, and increase the heart's pumping power. In addition, beta blockers may prevent a sudden cardiac arrest. Ideally, patients should start taking the drugs within 24 hours of an attack and stay on them indefinitely. However, you shouldn't take beta blockers if you have uncontrolled heart failure, a dangerously slow heart beat, dangerously low blood pressure, or active reactive airway disease (asthma).  Cholesterol-lowering drugs. If regular exercise and a healthy diet aren't enough to bring your cholesterol levels under control, your doctor can prescribe medications to finish the job. As a general rule, any heart attack survivor with an LDL cholesterol level over 100 mg/dL will need drug treatment.  The 2004 NCEP guidelines recommend statins or other cholesterol-lowering drugs for people with an LDL level above 100 mg/dl who are at high risk for a heart attack. (You are at high risk if you have coronary heart disease, diabetes, or multiple risk factors like smoking and high blood pressure.)  If you are at very high risk for a heart attack (which means you have heart disease plus other risk factors like smoking or diabetes, or have been hospitalized for a heart attack), doctors may recommend that you use drug therapy to bring your LDL readings below 70 mg/dL.  The most effective cholesterol medications available today belong to a class called "statins." These drugs (including simvastatin and lovastatin) can dramatically lower cholesterol levels and come with few side effects, although some patients complain of constipation, stomach pains, and cramps. Recent studies of heart patients have found that statins can lower the risk of fatal heart complications by 20 to 42 percent.  Aspirin. By thinning the blood and preventing blood clots, this humble pain-reliever can make a big difference. In a study of nearly 20,000 heart attack survivors, a daily dose of aspirin cut the risk of a second heart attack by more than 30 percent.  Because regular doses of aspirin can cause stomach problems, you should talk to your doctor before starting an aspirin routine. For most people, a low-to-medium dose (75 to 160 milligrams per day, or the equivalent of one to two baby aspirins) of an enteric coated aspirin provides ample protection with relatively few side effects. In fact, a Duke University review published in 2008 found that a low dose of 50 mg was just as effective as a dose of 325 mg, but with less risk of stomach bleeding.

Syed W. Bokhari, MD on behalf of Riverside Community Hospital    Cardiology (Cardiovascular Disease)         If you've had one heart attack, it's likely you'll have another in the next five to 10 years. In this video, Syed Bokhari, MD, an interventional cardiologist at Riverside Community Hospital, says that this risk is even higher for women.                     Marco T. Bologna, MD on behalf of Baptist Health South Florida    Thoracic Surgery (Cardiothoracic Vascular)         The American Heart Association estimates approximately one million heart attacks occur in the United States every year, including 320,000 recurrent cases. After the first heart attack, patients face a “substantial” risk of another attack, heart failure, a stroke or sudden death, according to the heart association; 18% of men and about 35% of women will have a second heart attack within five years of the first attack.
