 (NOAA) and other partners, Lightning Safety Week is held the last
 full week of June each year.  Lightning is one of the leading weather-related causes of death and injury in the United States. Most people do not realize that they can be struck by lightning even when the center of a thunderstorm is 10 miles (16 kilometers) away and there are blue skies overhead.

And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

It can possess more power than a nuclear reactor. Rolf Maeder, Photography Sedona Somewhere in the sky, in the guts of a storm, lightning is forming. Although it's rare, with the odds of getting struck in your lifetime being roughly 1 in 12,000 , every now and then a human will provide an attractive target for lightning bolts to unleash their power. And of the roughly 500 people who are struck by lightning each year, about 90% survive. Here's what you should expect if you ever find yourself in the path of lightning. How lightning forms Although we're still not sure what causes it, scientists believe that ice particles bumping together inside a cloud can cause an excess of negative charge to collect at the bottom of the cloud. This charge can be so powerful that it repels electrons, negatively charged particles, on the ground beneath it, causing the ground to become positively charged. As an insanely strong electrical field roils in the cloud above, an intense attraction builds between the cloud and the ground. Lightning is the runaway force that discharges this field. It races toward the ground at nearly 300,000 kilometers per hour, striking the ground with a power of 300 kV, up to 150 times stronger than an industrial shock. It can even exceed the power of a nuclear reactor . When the lightning hits the ground, it causes a trail of plasma that lights the sky with those telltale zigzags of blueish white light that we see as lightning. The first three milliseconds Lichtenberg figures are a type of scarring that can occur when you've been struck by lightning. Winston Kemp A lot can happen in the three milliseconds it takes for a lightning bolt to course through your body. As the lightning strikes and then exits your body, it will leave you with deep wounds, often accompanied with third degree burns. Your hair and clothing might singe or catch fire. Your cl othes might even be shredded by the explosive force of the surrounding air being superheated to up to 50,000 degrees F ( five times hotter than the surface of the sun ). If you happen to be wearing any metal objects, like necklaces or a piercings, they could channel the electric current, superheating and searing your skin. And if the lightning exits through your feet, the force could literally knock your shoes off . Blood vessels bursting from the electric discharge and heat might create something called a Lichtenberg figure on your skin. This is a pattern of scars that branches out across your body like the limbs of a tree, likely tracing the path the electricity took as it traveled through you. It's not uncommon for the blast to rupture your eardrums, possibly leading to hearing loss. And, of course, you can expect a whole world of pain. One victim recalled it as " the pain of a thousand wasps stinging from within ." In the wake of a lightning strike Immediately after being struck, the disruption the lightning would have caused to your heart's electrical rhythm could result in cardiac arrest , one of the leading causes of death in lightning strike victims. The shock could also cause seizures or respiratory arrest. If the electric current enters your skull, it could literally cook your brain, resulting in brain damage or putting you in a coma. The strike could even cause temporary or permanent paralysis. But it doesn't end there. In the wake of a lightning attack, you might be faced with a lifetime of neurological afflictions for reasons that scientists still don't fully understand. Some scientists believe that the lightning scrambles your internal circuitry , altering the behavior of your cells. You might undergo personality changes, mood swings, and memory loss. It's also possible that you will suffer from chronic pain and constant Parkinson's-like muscle twitches. In some cases, however, a lightning strike can lead to strange super talents. In a blog post for Psychology Today, University of Miami neuroscientist Berit Brogaard writes about an incident where an orthopedic surgeon who was struck by lightning developed an urge to learn to play the piano. He began to compose music he had mysteriously started hearing in his head since the strike. After a few months he abandoned his career as a surgeon and became a classical musician. This type of phenomenon baffles scientists. One theory that Brogaard says is currently being tested is that cell death caused by being struck by lightning could cause a one-time flooding of the brain with neurotransmitters that are released from the dying neurons. This causes a rewiring of neurons, providing access to areas of the brain that were previously inaccessible. But as cool as it would be, you shouldn't count on that stray bolt of electricity turning you into a prodigy in one swift flash. The overwhelming majority of consequences of being struck by lightning are painful and debilitating, and could stay with you for the rest of your life. While your chances of being struck by lightning are low, you can stay safe by tossing aside that fishing pole or golf club when you see clouds forming and heading indoors.

Sometimes, the electrical discharge can leave a tattoo-like marking or scar known as a Lichtenberg figure . The patterns created are known to be examples of fractals.  Lichtenberg figures are branching electric discharges that sometimes appear on the surface or the interior of insulating materials. They are named after the German physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who originally discovered and studied them. When they were first discovered, it was thought that their characteristic shapes might help to reveal the nature of positive and negative electric “fluids”.  In 1777, Lichtenberg built a large electrophorus to generate high voltage static electricity through induction. After discharging a high voltage point to the surface of an insulator, he recorded the resulting radial patterns in fixed dust. By then pressing blank sheets of paper onto these patterns, Lichtenberg was able to transfer and record these images, thereby discovering the basic principle of modern Xerography. This discovery was also the forerunner of modern day plasma physics.  Although Lichtenberg only studied 2-dimensional (2D) figures, modern high voltage researchers study 2D and 3D figures (electrical trees) on, and within, insulating materials [Souce: Wikipedia ]. There is a video at the end of this post that shows a Lichtenberg figure being created.  Below will find a small gallery of people who were struck by lightning and the fractal pattern it left behind.

And the odds of surviving one of these major bolts of electricity are surprisingly good. Only about one in 10 people who are struck by lightning are killed . But those who survive often experience immediate and lasting side-effects that can be as bizarre as they are unpleasant. "Lightning can cause injuries to every single organ system and neurological system in the body," Dr. George Rossie, a neuropsychologist, tells Elisabeth Kwak-Hefferan of Denver's 5280 magazine . Symptoms include everything from forgetfulness and irritability to personalty changes or depression, which may be related to actual nerve damage or a psychological effect. Kwak-Hefferan describes the experience of three lightning strike survivors in her article. Here are some of the highlights: Phil Broscovak, of Wyoming, was electrocuted by a bolt of lightning during a climbing trip. He described the pain as "being stung by 10,000 wasps from the inside out." Broscovak suffered damage to his nervous system. He experienced severe mood swings and insomnia. Some days he could not speak or write basic words. Brock Nevill was hiking through the woods when a lightning bolt struck a tree he had been leaning up against, and stopped his heart. The 15-year-old was bed-ridden for three months and doesn't remember anything after his rescue. Now 21, he's mostly recovered, but has been allergic to metal since the strike. Betsy Smith lost consciousness when she was hit by lightning on a rock ledge in Wyoming. " I was convinced my body had become soup inside my clothes ," she told the magazine. Smith was out for 45 minutes and her left arm was severely burned. One of her fingers had to be amputated too.

That talking on the telephone is the leading cause of lightning injuries inside the home? That standing under a tall tree is one of the most dangerous places to take shelter? And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

The year was 1969 when Steve Marshburn was struck by lightning. He wasn’t out golfing or fishing, he was working inside a bank. Lightning found a path through an underground speaker at the drive-through window and worked its way to the stool where he sat. "I still have the migraines," Marshburn told NPR . "The lightning – when it hit my back, it went up my spine, went to the left side of my brain and scorched it, came down, went out my right hand that was holding a metal teller stamp." Which goes to show, lightning is an unruly beast; heard to predict and filled with surprises. And according to the National Weather Service, so far this year lightning strikes have killed at least 20 people in the United States, which is almost double the norm. Behind those strikes are some pretty wild facts. Consider the following: 1. Lightning strikes the United States about 25 million times a year. Although most lightning occurs in the summer, people can be struck at any time of year. 2. The idea of a lightning bolt finding and striking a person directly seems so random, but in fact, most people who were hurt or injured weren’t struck directly . People can fall victim to lightning striking a nearby object when the current jumps, as well as through conduction and ground current. 3. Because ground current strikes affect a much larger area than the other causes of lightning casualties – the current travels over the surface of the ground – this type causes the most lightning deaths and injuries. It's especially bad for livestock. 4. As evidenced by Marshburn’s experience, you don't have to be outside to be harmed by nearby lightning. 5. Brain injuries are the more common injury – rather than burns – from lightning strikes. 6. Lightning strikes can create enduring lifelong discomfort because they cause nerve damage that makes the nerves misfire, which the brain reads as pain. 7. Even though strikes are up this year, the number is much less than in the 1940s when 300 to 400 people died annually. John Jensenius from the National Weather Service explains, "Most homes had corded phones. So a corded phone, when people held it right up to their head, was a direct connection with wires outside." Also, more farmers sitting on open tractors added to the numbers. 8. While people think golfers are at highest risk, between 2006 and 2014 , people fishing accounted for more than three times as many deaths as golfers, while camping and boating each were responsible for almost two times as many deaths as golf. 9. During the same period, the majority of victims were male between the ages of 10 to 60; almost two thirds of them were engaged in outdoor leisure activities before being struck. 10. To measure the distance of lightning, count the seconds between flash and thunder and divide by five; the number is how many miles the lightning is from you. 11. During thunderstorms, lightning can strike up to 10 miles away. That distance is when you can just begin to hear thunder, which is why safety experts urge us to go inside as soon as we hear a distant rumble. Many victims have been either heading to safety at the time of the fatal strike or were just steps away from safety. In addition, follow these safety tips from the National Weather Service: When you hear thunder, immediately move to safe shelter: a substantial building with electricity or plumbing or an enclosed, metal-topped vehicle with windows up. Stay in safe shelter at least 30 minutes after you hear the last sound of thunder. Stay off corded phones, computers and other electrical equipment that put you in direct contact with electricity. Avoid plumbing, including sinks, baths and faucets. Stay away from windows and doors, and stay off porches. Do not lie on concrete floors, and do not lean against concrete walls. If you are caught outside with no safe shelter anywhere nearby the following actions may reduce your risk: Immediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges or peaks. Never lie flat on the ground. Never shelter under an isolated tree. Never use a cliff or rocky overhang for shelter. Immediately get out and away from ponds, lakes and other bodies of water. Stay away from objects that conduct electricity (barbed wire fences, power lines, windmills, etc.). And in a story on lightning in The Week , Charlotte Huff also recommends to "look for a ravine or a depression. Spread out your group, with at least 20 feet between each person, to reduce the risk of multiple injuries. Don't lie down, which boosts your exposure to ground current. There's even a recommended lightning position: crouched down, keeping the feet close together." This updated story was originally published in 2015.

Apparently, the chances are 300,000 to one, according to David Hand in his new book: The Improbability Principle. But while 300,000 to one looks like a minor risk for an individual, there are lots of people on the planet.  Small Data  A series on curious numbers cropping up in the news, by stats watcher Anthony Reuben  As a result, about 24,000 people are killed by lightning each year. Remember, you don't have to be struck by lightning to be killed by it - you could be in a house that's struck by lightning and burns down with you inside. Indeed, with seven billion people on the planet, what would be really, really unlikely would be that nobody was killed by lightning. Of course, 300,000 to one is an average - people in the developing world who spend less time indoors and have fewer tall buildings and more flammable ones are much more likely to be killed by lightning than people in developed ones. On average, three people are killed each year by lightning in the UK, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which are odds 66 times shorter than the global average. Hand's book sets out to explain why things that are considered to be very unlikely keep on happening. It's not just that people win the lottery. Again, while that's unlikely for an individual, it's pretty likely that someone will win it each week. No, we're talking about really unlikely things, like the lottery drawing the same numbers in two consecutive weeks, as happened on the Bulgarian Lottery in 2009. So, if you wait around long enough, it looks like you'll get to see almost anything happen. But not a man being struck by lightning twice in succession, seen on a security camera. The video of that, which Hand showed as part of a talk to the Royal Statistical Society on Thursday, is widely described on the internet as having been a fake. Maybe we'll have to wait a bit longer to see that.

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers Quora User , Trust me, I'm an engineer. Answered Aug 20, 2015 We’ve all heard the reality check before: “You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery. The odds of being struck by lightning, however, are not as simple as we would like them to be. The answer to the question, “What are the odds of being struck by lightning?” is actually, “It depends.” What is the origin of this "one million" number? US population is around 300.000.000 and you can find that the number of injuries due to lightnings is around 300 in average in the US which leads us to this 1 in a million if you live in the US.. What’s particularly noteworthy is that depending on which state you’re in within the United States, your odds of being struck by lightning this year can be much higher or much lower than that 1 in a million figure mentioned above. This map holds for the US again and shows the zone you have more risk to be hit: Clearly, the odds of being struck by lightning are not the same for everyone, everywhere, but why?  We face varying odds of being struck by lightning because of a few key factors. These essentially location-specific factors include: Cloud-to-ground lightning density rates, population size, indoor vs. outdoor activity setting and safety adherence. Indeed, a parameter which sounds obvious is the time you spend outdoor.  More time spent outdoors increases the odds of being struck by lightning. In places where people work and engage in more activities outdoors, the odds of being struck by lightning tend to be higher. Something that has strucked me when I did my researches on the topic is how the lightning safety has evolved the last decades. Prevention seems to be the key to reduce the number of deaths due to storms (about 10% of people, or 1 in 10, struck by lightning are killed). See how there has been an overall decline in lightning fatalities in the U.S. since 1940, largely due to the impact of public education efforts and increased public recognition of the value of following safety principles. I'll finish by giving some numbers: Males accounted for 81% of lightning fatalities. More than 70% of lightning deaths occurred in the months of June, July and August. Slightly more lightning deaths happened on Saturdays and Sundays than other days of the week. Individuals in the age range of 10-60 comprised the greatest number of lightning fatalities, with the 20-29 age bracket having the highest concentration of lightning fatalities. 64% of lightning deaths were related to leisure activities, followed by 17% of lightning deaths related to daily routine and 15% related to work. I feel that you are already asking yourself the same question that I asked myself: why the **** are men the main targets??!? As much as we were hoping to uncover a biological cause—extra iron in the male cranium, perhaps, or the conductive properties of testosterone—it turns out men are... just kind of stupid. "Men take more risks in lightning storms," says John Jensenius, a lightning safety expert with the National Weather Service. For men, Todd says, the risk of getting struck by lightning could be outweighed by the reward of proving to other men—and potential female mates—that they're not afraid of getting struck by lightning. This is particularly true for young men, who have the most to gain by impressing others, thereby raising their status as attractive, daring, healthy mates in the dating pool. And then, zap! In conclusion, if you're a man, not that clever, and you play baseball during the hot weekends of August, then get cover!! 2.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Samarth Singh (Sam) , Commercial Pilot - King Air B200 / 350 Updated Dec 16, 2015 · Author has 208 answers and 527.3k answer views This might scare you. Lightning strikes aircraft all the time, very often. Odds are you've already been in an aircraft that has been struck by lightning. Some reports claim every active aircraft in the world gets struck by lightning once in a year on average. The good news, however, is that a negligible number of these lightning strikes raise any concern at all. Lets explain. Modern airliners are basically made of aluminum. Most of the outer casing, the skin of the fuselage is aluminum which is an extremely good conductor of electricity. Post the 1960s which is when the last set of catastrophic lightning strikes were reported, engineers and researchers have learnt a lot and found that preparing an aircraft for lightning strikes is not all that difficult. A modern airliner has 2 major areas of concern. A spark anywhere near the fuel, and the lightning affecting avionics and instrumentation since a modern airlines like a 737 or a 320 carry a lot of electronics and computers on board. In most cases, an aircraft flying through a thunderstorm causes lightning to pass through it since it makes for an excellent conductor between the positively and negatively charged parts of a cloud cell. When this happens, lightning enters through a single point on the aircraft, perhaps the nose, or the top of a wing or the top of the tail and exits through a similar surface. For the split second that lightning passes through the craft, it conducts across the entire outer casing (fuselage skin). Some passengers and pilots have reported a large flash, some a large bang and some absolutely nothing while an aircraft is struck. Pilots often report a split second confusion in the instrumentation, most obvious being the magnetic compass dancing. The fact of the matter is that scientists have managed to keep the electricity passing through an aircraft very well contained on the outside, so it's hardly a concern anymore. The fuel system is well isolated from the atmosphere, so are the passengers and the instrumentation. The nose of the aircraft is of significant concern when protecting it against a lightning strike because it is one of the most probable areas an aircraft may get struck. Also, it houses the AWR (Airborne Weather Radar) which cannot be concealed or covered to protect it. So scientists have devised various effective ways to deflect lightning off the nose of the aircraft and over to the rest of the fuselage. With airliners now being constructed of better, lighter and less conductive composites, like the 787 dreamliners, lightning is slowly dwindling as a concern to modern aviation. I hope this answer helps. :) 8.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question Quora User , I like cheese :) Answered Jul 23, 2017 tl:dr : The probability that a plane will get struck by lightning in a given trip is between 1/2400 and 1/1200, so between 0.0004167 and 0.0008333 . However, the last time people died from lightning striking a plane was 1967, which was half a century ago and before a lot of newfangled regulations that help keep people safe (like making lightning wicks required). . Planes are very safe. Planes fly through lots of bad weather, and they are designed to be struck by lightning. Don’t worry about it. Like I said, the last time anyone died from this was in 1967, when lightning hit the fuel tank of the airplane (← click on the link for more info). 2. OK, now for math. According to Scientific American , on average, “each airplane in the U.S. commercial fleet is struck lightly by lightning more than once each year”. I don’t know where they got that, but let’s roll with it. In 2016, the FFA recorded 16,054,495 flights, and 6,676 commercial aircraft, so about 2400 flights per aircraft annually. If each aircraft gets struck by lightning once or twice a year, the odds of an aircraft being struck by lightning are between 0.0004167 and 0.0008333 . That’s literally less than one in a thousand at the worst, and half that at the best. .

No, the fact that you have been hit does not make you a more likely target for another hit. But a bit yes, because being hit by lightning often happens to people that have occupations that expose them to the weather, in locations where lightning happens more often. And such people keep that danger around them. That is why you hear stories about people that have been hit more than once. 14.8k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

That being said, the variables that assisted 'X' in initially occurring may be similarly generated on innumerable occasions, and in the cases of natural environs may have been likewise reoccurring for millenia. Using common sense as our guide we look at deliberate functions of structures that have 'built-ins' for lightning to find them attractive - such as, very obviously, lightning rods (conductors protruding from the highest points but directly 'shorted' to earth with enough material density to carry a lightning strike). Ships and boats have them to carry lightning straight to water during a storm as they are usually higher than waves Secondarily, a building may have a mass of such density so that lightning finds it represents a shorter path to ground. Don't forget, Dr Frankenstein regularly harvested lightning for his reanimation experiments. Where I lived at Bucketty, NSW, Australia there was so much ironstone in the sandstone of the hills we were regularly without power after lightning strikes so it is more than likely any environment can be naturally or artificially created to repeatedly attract lightning so long as it represents a path of least resistance. 1.6k Views Thank you for your feedback!

Lightning does not strike randomly or independently, it takes the path of least resistance, which doesn't change much between storms. For example, lightning typically strikes the top of the empire state building 100 times a year, often multiple times during the same storm. Also, independence would mean that the probability it happens twice is equal to the square of the probability it happens once. If the probability it happened twice was equal to the probability it occurred at all, the events would be completely dependent. (It would also mean lightning never strikes only once.) 5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?   Gerhard Adam Answered Oct 3, 2014 · Author has 971 answers and 468.2k answer views It's 100% since lightning occurs in multiple strikes for each visible occurrence.  So, by definition, a lightning strikes has hit the same place several times. Rather obvious examples such as the Empire State Building or the Sears Tower gets struck thousands of times.  So, multiple strikes are 100% assured to occur.

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers Quora User , Eclectineer Answered May 7, 2014 Good link for you on a man struck at least 7 times in a range of locales: Roy Sullivan From the same Wiki page as above: Statistics[ edit ] Top: World map showing relative frequency of lightning strikes. Bottom: US map showing location of Virginia, which has a relatively high lightning rate. The odds of being struck by lightning for a person over the period of 80 years have been roughly estimated as 1:10000. [9] If the lightning strikes were independent events, the probability of being hit seven times would be 1:100007 = 1:1028. These numbers do not quite apply to Sullivan, however, who by the nature of his work was more exposed to storms than the average person. Virginia, where he lived, averages 35 to 45 thunderstorm days per year, most of which fall in June, July, and August. Between 1959 and 2000 lightning killed 58 people and injured at least 238 people in Virginia. In the United States, 3239 people were killed and 13,057 injured by lightning in the same period. Most of those were males between 20 and 40 years old caught outdoors.

Click here to get 30 days free!      We’ve all heard the reality check before: “You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery.”  To most of us, the odds of being struck by lightning, “ 1 in a million ,” are a convenient measuring rod for all things unlikely. Whether it’s winning the lottery or dying in a plane crash, if something is less likely to happen to you than being struck by lightning, then, as the logic goes, it’s probably not worth holding your breath for or worrying about very much (discussions along these very lines can be found here and here ).    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT       Lightning Odds…Not So Simple…  The odds of being struck by lightning, however, are not as simple as we would have them to be. The answer to the question, “What are the odds of being struck by lightning?” is actually, “It depends.”    The Numbers Behind '1 in a Million' That the odds of being struck by lightning are approximately 1 in a million is perhaps one of the most well-known statistics out there. This statistic is nonetheless, an average of the odds of being struck by lightning in the United States. According to the U.S. National Weather Service, this statistic is based on averages of reported lightning deaths and injuries along a U.S. population estimate: Estimated U.S. population as of 2011: 310,000,000 Average Annual Reported U.S. Lightning Deaths and Injures, 2001-2010: 280 Odds of being struck by lightning in a given year  (reported deaths + injuries) =1 in (310,000,000/280) = 1 in 1,107,143 =  Approximately 1 in a million  What’s particularly noteworthy is that depending on which state you’re in within the United States, your odds of being struck by lightning this year can be much higher or much lower than that 1 in a million figure mentioned above. For example, based on lightning data (courtesy StruckByLightning.org ) and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for 2011 presented in the map below, if you live in Montana, your odds of being struck by lightning are roughly 1 in 249,550, considerably higher than the the national average of 1 in a million. Towards the other end of the spectrum, in California, your odds of being struck by lightning are far lower at 1 in 7,538,382.  Lightning Map The Odds of Being Struck By Lightning, By State Click on this map to see the odds of being struck by lightning in your state (based on 2011 lightning data).  Clearly, the odds of being struck by lightning are not the same for everyone, everywhere, but why?  We face varying odds of being struck by lightning because of a few key factors. These essentially location-specific factors include: Cloud-to-ground lightning density rates, population size, indoor vs. outdoor activity setting and safety adherence. Now Available on Amazon  Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities by Jeffrey Rosenthal From terrorist attacks to big money jackpots, Struck by Lightning  deconstructs the odds and oddities of chance, examining both the relevant and irreverent role of randomness in our everyday lives..airplanes crash, bridges collapse, and we never know if we’ll be that one in a million statistic. A basic understanding of the rules of probability theory, applied to real-life circumstances, can help us to make sense of these situations, to avoid unnecessary fear, to seize the opportunities that randomness presents to us, and to actually enjoy the uncertainties we face. In this entertaining yet sophisticated look at the world of probabilities, author Jeffrey Rosenthal–an improbably talented math professor–explains the mechanics of randomness and teaches us how to develop an informed perspective on probability. U.S. Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Density This Vaisala National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) map shows the average annual lightning flash density within the continental U.S. from 1997-2011. In terms of cloud-to-ground lightning averages, Florida ranks highest, with an average of 1,414,284 flashes per year (24.7 flashes per square mile). Historically, Florida has also experienced the highest lightning number of lightning deaths in the United States, with 425 deaths occurring there from 1950-2003. Washington has the lowest cloud-to-ground lightning averages, 20,510 flashes per year (0.3 flashes per square mile). Population State population plays in a key role in determining your odds of being struck by lightning. Florida tops all the states both in terms of cloud-to-ground lightning density and the number of lightning casualties reported annually (31 in 2011), but because of Florida’s population size, an estimated 19,057,542 for 2011, the odds of being struck by lightning there were 1 in 614,759. These odds are lower  than Montana’s 1 in 249,550, even though Montana had only 4 lightning casualties, because in comparison, Montana’s estimated 2011 population was much smaller: 998,199. Indoor vs. Outdoor Simply put, more time spent outdoors increases the odds of being struck by lightning. In places where people work and engage in more activities outdoors, the odds of being struck by lightning tend to be higher. Lightning Fatalities: What Are the Odds of Being Killed by Lightning? According to U.S. NWS Storm Data for the 30 year period spanning the years 1984-2013, about 10% of people, or 1 in 10, struck by lightning are killed  . A recent report, A Detailed Analysis of Lightning Deaths in the United States from 2006 through 2013 , by lightning safety specialist, John S. Jensenius, Jr. at the National Weather Service, NOAA, revealed the following insights into lightning deaths:    Males accounted for 81% of lightning fatalities.  More than 70% of lightning deaths occurred in the months of June, July and August.  Slightly more lightning deaths happened on Saturdays and Sundays than other days of the week.  Individuals in the age range of 10-60 comprised the greatest number of lightning fatalities, with the 20-29 age bracket having the highest concentration of lightning fatalities.  64% of lightning deaths were related to leisure activities, followed by 17% of lightning deaths related to daily routine and 15% related to work.   Did You Know? As discussed in a USA Today article by Doyle Rice, there has been an overall decline in lightning fatalities in the U.S. since 1940, largely due to the impact of public education efforts and increased public recognition of the value of following safety principles.  Lightning Safety The U.S. National Weather Service cautions that when there is a thunderstorm in the area, no place outside that is safe. Moreover, if you can hear thunder, that means that lightning is, in fact, close enough to strike you . If you are outdoors when you hear thunder, seek safe shelter. In short, when it comes to lightning, the message that lightning experts and organizations regard as being the most crucial is to go indoors when there is a thunderstorm in the area. Thus, the National Weather Service , StruckByLighting.org and others have worked hard to get the simple message out: “ When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors!” Featured Image Credit: Brilhasti1/Flickr     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Email Print    Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

By Laura Albert     There is not nearly enough information available on the Internet on the conditional probability of being struck by lightning.  I think of the odds of being struck by lightning and conditional probability every time I am in a thunderstorm. The conditional probability of being struck by lightning is probably not 1 in 6. NOAA estimates that the (unconditional) probability of being struck by lightning is ~1 in 1,000,000 per year and ~1 in 10,000 over a lifetime. That’s of little solace when I’m out running a few miles from home when a thunderstorm rolls in.  Jeffrey Seth Rosenthal’s book Struck by Lightning does not exactly answer this question. He does, however, report the annual probability of being struck by lightning conditioned on where on lives. Below are the figures from his book on the most dangerous states, the safest states, and the most dangerous countries (at least in terms of being struck by lightning). The “Annual Rates” report the expected number of people struck by lightning per year per 100,000. This could be due to differences in the prior probabilities (some areas have more thunderstorms than others) or in attitudes toward risk in thunderstorms.     Any idea of what the conditional probability of being struck by lightning would be given that one is outside in a thunderstorm? I need to know how much to panic the next time a thunderstorm rolls in when I am running.  There is a part II , part III , and part IV to this series.

Our fatality rate is lower than in the US.  Also the statistics show that about five times as many men die as women.  See http://www.torro.org.uk/site/lightning_info.php But, as for: Prob(Laura is hit by lightning before she reaches home | Laura is running miles from home AND there is a thunderstorm) all I can say is it is in the range 0 < p < 1 without equality.              S. Phil Kim (@ksphil)    February 9th, 2012 at 10:00 am    The answer is all about how often people is outside when there is a thunderstorm. Of cause, I am assuming that all the event lightening strike happen outside.  If we can get the data from survey “how many times have you been outside in a thunderstorm a year?”(xi for i th person). Then 45 / Sum(xi) i \in population of American will be the Conditional probability of being stuck by lightening. Let’s say, an average American have been outside in a thunderstorm 0.5 times per year. then, 90/7million is the answer. But, how long should one be outside to be considered as been outside ?  If we consider the time expose to the thunderstorm, it would be more precise. Assuming the event happen as poisson process, we will need to estimate the rate and then we can calculate the probability if one is outside in a thunderstorm for an hour, for example. This case we need to know an average hour people spend outside in a thunderstorm.  Anyway, the portability will go up significantly, because I think most of people will not stay outside when there is a thunderstorm.              Paul A. Rubin    February 9th, 2012 at 5:02 pm    First, the death rate its higher for men because men will continue to play golf (raising metal clubs) during a t-storm. Second, I’ve actually heard of indoor”lightning”, but the story its too long to fit here. Third, in addition to time of exposure, Laura would need to factor in terrain (trees, presence of metal above our below the surface) and the fact that she has above average height. (A lazy lightning bolt will take her before it takes me … unless I’m swinging a golf club.)              Michael C. Grant    February 9th, 2012 at 6:52 pm    I wonder if the metal in my leg reduces my resistance to ground. 😛             Laura McLay   February 9th, 2012 at 8:24 pm    Thoughts from my husband:  why not ask the question this way: what is the probability that a given thunderstorm will injure or kill someone? I googled some stats, and found that the NWS estimates 100000 thunderstorms in the U.S. per year:  http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0052833/m0052833.asp#head002000000000000  The same source quotes about 100 deaths per year, and 257 lightning related injuries per year.  More recent data indicates that the fatalities have been declining to 55 per year averaged 1980-2009:  http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/fatalities.htm  Assume that most incidents are individuals and not groups (seems valid given the tabular data from 2011), for any given storm P(death) = 55/100000 and P(injury) = 257/100000. Of course this is just a rough estimate, and perhaps with better data you could make estimates for geographic regions or specific time of year. Note that the NOAA link indicates that 73% (40/55) of deaths occur in the summer months, but then I’d expect that the majority of thunderstorms also occur in those months.              Jeffrey W. Herrmann    February 10th, 2012 at 8:31 am    I agree that the rates based on where one lives are not relevant to the conditional probability that we’re discussing; the rates above reflect the differences in thunderstorm frequency, the number of people who work and play outside, and other factors.

Laura McLay   February 11th, 2012 at 2:57 pm    @Jeffrey: I completely agree about the locations not being particularly relevant. But they were interesting in their own right, so I included them. I wonder if they *do* shed light on the conditional probability of interest. Perhaps in some locations, lightning tends to hit the ground more frequently? Not all lightning storms may be equally dangerous.  @Paul: I completely agree. Central Illinois was flat and had few trees. I felt like I had a target on me during every thunderstorm. I tried to modify my habits, but when I was a student, I got around by foot. Some risk was unavoidable. Luckily, I survived! 😉              Jeffrey W. Herrmann    February 11th, 2012 at 5:36 pm    Laura,  I didn’t intend to criticize your including the table of location-specific lightning mortality rates in your post; the fault lies with the author who intended such a table as a way to communicate a quite-controllable risk.

The advice (and I am not making this up) is to stand on one leg, to minimise the effect of electricity transmitted across the stance.             Laura McLay   February 13th, 2012 at 8:48 am    Chris: Thank you! I think that the vast majority of people who are struck by lightning survive. I went to high school with someone who was struck by lightning and lived, so I am well aware of this. Your advice to stand on one leg is consistent with other advice I have heard about how to position the arms. I think that these poses do not encourage the lightning to cross the chest, which would cause the heart to stop beating. But I’m not a real doctor.             Laura McLay   February 13th, 2012 at 8:55 am    Jeffrey: no offense taken! Thanks for your clarification. The tables do not display exactly what I would like them to, but they are the best that I have. They are, I think, useful for starting to unpack the impact of the frequency of lightning, the odds that people are outside in storms, and the impact of infrastructure in lowering the conditional probability. For example, the high rate in Cuba could reflect more manual laborers who remain outside in a storm? Or are the different building codes in different countries indirectly factoring into different conditional probabilities? I’m relying on the collective wisdom of my readers here.

 (NOAA) and other partners, Lightning Safety Week is held the last
 full week of June each year.  Lightning is one of the leading weather-related causes of death and injury in the United States. Most people do not realize that they can be struck by lightning even when the center of a thunderstorm is 10 miles (16 kilometers) away and there are blue skies overhead.

And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

It can possess more power than a nuclear reactor. Rolf Maeder, Photography Sedona Somewhere in the sky, in the guts of a storm, lightning is forming. Although it's rare, with the odds of getting struck in your lifetime being roughly 1 in 12,000 , every now and then a human will provide an attractive target for lightning bolts to unleash their power. And of the roughly 500 people who are struck by lightning each year, about 90% survive. Here's what you should expect if you ever find yourself in the path of lightning. How lightning forms Although we're still not sure what causes it, scientists believe that ice particles bumping together inside a cloud can cause an excess of negative charge to collect at the bottom of the cloud. This charge can be so powerful that it repels electrons, negatively charged particles, on the ground beneath it, causing the ground to become positively charged. As an insanely strong electrical field roils in the cloud above, an intense attraction builds between the cloud and the ground. Lightning is the runaway force that discharges this field. It races toward the ground at nearly 300,000 kilometers per hour, striking the ground with a power of 300 kV, up to 150 times stronger than an industrial shock. It can even exceed the power of a nuclear reactor . When the lightning hits the ground, it causes a trail of plasma that lights the sky with those telltale zigzags of blueish white light that we see as lightning. The first three milliseconds Lichtenberg figures are a type of scarring that can occur when you've been struck by lightning. Winston Kemp A lot can happen in the three milliseconds it takes for a lightning bolt to course through your body. As the lightning strikes and then exits your body, it will leave you with deep wounds, often accompanied with third degree burns. Your hair and clothing might singe or catch fire. Your cl othes might even be shredded by the explosive force of the surrounding air being superheated to up to 50,000 degrees F ( five times hotter than the surface of the sun ). If you happen to be wearing any metal objects, like necklaces or a piercings, they could channel the electric current, superheating and searing your skin. And if the lightning exits through your feet, the force could literally knock your shoes off . Blood vessels bursting from the electric discharge and heat might create something called a Lichtenberg figure on your skin. This is a pattern of scars that branches out across your body like the limbs of a tree, likely tracing the path the electricity took as it traveled through you. It's not uncommon for the blast to rupture your eardrums, possibly leading to hearing loss. And, of course, you can expect a whole world of pain. One victim recalled it as " the pain of a thousand wasps stinging from within ." In the wake of a lightning strike Immediately after being struck, the disruption the lightning would have caused to your heart's electrical rhythm could result in cardiac arrest , one of the leading causes of death in lightning strike victims. The shock could also cause seizures or respiratory arrest. If the electric current enters your skull, it could literally cook your brain, resulting in brain damage or putting you in a coma. The strike could even cause temporary or permanent paralysis. But it doesn't end there. In the wake of a lightning attack, you might be faced with a lifetime of neurological afflictions for reasons that scientists still don't fully understand. Some scientists believe that the lightning scrambles your internal circuitry , altering the behavior of your cells. You might undergo personality changes, mood swings, and memory loss. It's also possible that you will suffer from chronic pain and constant Parkinson's-like muscle twitches. In some cases, however, a lightning strike can lead to strange super talents. In a blog post for Psychology Today, University of Miami neuroscientist Berit Brogaard writes about an incident where an orthopedic surgeon who was struck by lightning developed an urge to learn to play the piano. He began to compose music he had mysteriously started hearing in his head since the strike. After a few months he abandoned his career as a surgeon and became a classical musician. This type of phenomenon baffles scientists. One theory that Brogaard says is currently being tested is that cell death caused by being struck by lightning could cause a one-time flooding of the brain with neurotransmitters that are released from the dying neurons. This causes a rewiring of neurons, providing access to areas of the brain that were previously inaccessible. But as cool as it would be, you shouldn't count on that stray bolt of electricity turning you into a prodigy in one swift flash. The overwhelming majority of consequences of being struck by lightning are painful and debilitating, and could stay with you for the rest of your life. While your chances of being struck by lightning are low, you can stay safe by tossing aside that fishing pole or golf club when you see clouds forming and heading indoors.

Sometimes, the electrical discharge can leave a tattoo-like marking or scar known as a Lichtenberg figure . The patterns created are known to be examples of fractals.  Lichtenberg figures are branching electric discharges that sometimes appear on the surface or the interior of insulating materials. They are named after the German physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who originally discovered and studied them. When they were first discovered, it was thought that their characteristic shapes might help to reveal the nature of positive and negative electric “fluids”.  In 1777, Lichtenberg built a large electrophorus to generate high voltage static electricity through induction. After discharging a high voltage point to the surface of an insulator, he recorded the resulting radial patterns in fixed dust. By then pressing blank sheets of paper onto these patterns, Lichtenberg was able to transfer and record these images, thereby discovering the basic principle of modern Xerography. This discovery was also the forerunner of modern day plasma physics.  Although Lichtenberg only studied 2-dimensional (2D) figures, modern high voltage researchers study 2D and 3D figures (electrical trees) on, and within, insulating materials [Souce: Wikipedia ]. There is a video at the end of this post that shows a Lichtenberg figure being created.  Below will find a small gallery of people who were struck by lightning and the fractal pattern it left behind.

And the odds of surviving one of these major bolts of electricity are surprisingly good. Only about one in 10 people who are struck by lightning are killed . But those who survive often experience immediate and lasting side-effects that can be as bizarre as they are unpleasant. "Lightning can cause injuries to every single organ system and neurological system in the body," Dr. George Rossie, a neuropsychologist, tells Elisabeth Kwak-Hefferan of Denver's 5280 magazine . Symptoms include everything from forgetfulness and irritability to personalty changes or depression, which may be related to actual nerve damage or a psychological effect. Kwak-Hefferan describes the experience of three lightning strike survivors in her article. Here are some of the highlights: Phil Broscovak, of Wyoming, was electrocuted by a bolt of lightning during a climbing trip. He described the pain as "being stung by 10,000 wasps from the inside out." Broscovak suffered damage to his nervous system. He experienced severe mood swings and insomnia. Some days he could not speak or write basic words. Brock Nevill was hiking through the woods when a lightning bolt struck a tree he had been leaning up against, and stopped his heart. The 15-year-old was bed-ridden for three months and doesn't remember anything after his rescue. Now 21, he's mostly recovered, but has been allergic to metal since the strike. Betsy Smith lost consciousness when she was hit by lightning on a rock ledge in Wyoming. " I was convinced my body had become soup inside my clothes ," she told the magazine. Smith was out for 45 minutes and her left arm was severely burned. One of her fingers had to be amputated too.

 (NOAA) and other partners, Lightning Safety Week is held the last
 full week of June each year.  Lightning is one of the leading weather-related causes of death and injury in the United States. Most people do not realize that they can be struck by lightning even when the center of a thunderstorm is 10 miles (16 kilometers) away and there are blue skies overhead.

That talking on the telephone is the leading cause of lightning injuries inside the home? That standing under a tall tree is one of the most dangerous places to take shelter? And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

The year was 1969 when Steve Marshburn was struck by lightning. He wasn’t out golfing or fishing, he was working inside a bank. Lightning found a path through an underground speaker at the drive-through window and worked its way to the stool where he sat. "I still have the migraines," Marshburn told NPR . "The lightning – when it hit my back, it went up my spine, went to the left side of my brain and scorched it, came down, went out my right hand that was holding a metal teller stamp." Which goes to show, lightning is an unruly beast; heard to predict and filled with surprises. And according to the National Weather Service, so far this year lightning strikes have killed at least 20 people in the United States, which is almost double the norm. Behind those strikes are some pretty wild facts. Consider the following: 1. Lightning strikes the United States about 25 million times a year. Although most lightning occurs in the summer, people can be struck at any time of year. 2. The idea of a lightning bolt finding and striking a person directly seems so random, but in fact, most people who were hurt or injured weren’t struck directly . People can fall victim to lightning striking a nearby object when the current jumps, as well as through conduction and ground current. 3. Because ground current strikes affect a much larger area than the other causes of lightning casualties – the current travels over the surface of the ground – this type causes the most lightning deaths and injuries. It's especially bad for livestock. 4. As evidenced by Marshburn’s experience, you don't have to be outside to be harmed by nearby lightning. 5. Brain injuries are the more common injury – rather than burns – from lightning strikes. 6. Lightning strikes can create enduring lifelong discomfort because they cause nerve damage that makes the nerves misfire, which the brain reads as pain. 7. Even though strikes are up this year, the number is much less than in the 1940s when 300 to 400 people died annually. John Jensenius from the National Weather Service explains, "Most homes had corded phones. So a corded phone, when people held it right up to their head, was a direct connection with wires outside." Also, more farmers sitting on open tractors added to the numbers. 8. While people think golfers are at highest risk, between 2006 and 2014 , people fishing accounted for more than three times as many deaths as golfers, while camping and boating each were responsible for almost two times as many deaths as golf. 9. During the same period, the majority of victims were male between the ages of 10 to 60; almost two thirds of them were engaged in outdoor leisure activities before being struck. 10. To measure the distance of lightning, count the seconds between flash and thunder and divide by five; the number is how many miles the lightning is from you. 11. During thunderstorms, lightning can strike up to 10 miles away. That distance is when you can just begin to hear thunder, which is why safety experts urge us to go inside as soon as we hear a distant rumble. Many victims have been either heading to safety at the time of the fatal strike or were just steps away from safety. In addition, follow these safety tips from the National Weather Service: When you hear thunder, immediately move to safe shelter: a substantial building with electricity or plumbing or an enclosed, metal-topped vehicle with windows up. Stay in safe shelter at least 30 minutes after you hear the last sound of thunder. Stay off corded phones, computers and other electrical equipment that put you in direct contact with electricity. Avoid plumbing, including sinks, baths and faucets. Stay away from windows and doors, and stay off porches. Do not lie on concrete floors, and do not lean against concrete walls. If you are caught outside with no safe shelter anywhere nearby the following actions may reduce your risk: Immediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges or peaks. Never lie flat on the ground. Never shelter under an isolated tree. Never use a cliff or rocky overhang for shelter. Immediately get out and away from ponds, lakes and other bodies of water. Stay away from objects that conduct electricity (barbed wire fences, power lines, windmills, etc.). And in a story on lightning in The Week , Charlotte Huff also recommends to "look for a ravine or a depression. Spread out your group, with at least 20 feet between each person, to reduce the risk of multiple injuries. Don't lie down, which boosts your exposure to ground current. There's even a recommended lightning position: crouched down, keeping the feet close together." This updated story was originally published in 2015.

Apparently, the chances are 300,000 to one, according to David Hand in his new book: The Improbability Principle. But while 300,000 to one looks like a minor risk for an individual, there are lots of people on the planet.  Small Data  A series on curious numbers cropping up in the news, by stats watcher Anthony Reuben  As a result, about 24,000 people are killed by lightning each year. Remember, you don't have to be struck by lightning to be killed by it - you could be in a house that's struck by lightning and burns down with you inside. Indeed, with seven billion people on the planet, what would be really, really unlikely would be that nobody was killed by lightning. Of course, 300,000 to one is an average - people in the developing world who spend less time indoors and have fewer tall buildings and more flammable ones are much more likely to be killed by lightning than people in developed ones. On average, three people are killed each year by lightning in the UK, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which are odds 66 times shorter than the global average. Hand's book sets out to explain why things that are considered to be very unlikely keep on happening. It's not just that people win the lottery. Again, while that's unlikely for an individual, it's pretty likely that someone will win it each week. No, we're talking about really unlikely things, like the lottery drawing the same numbers in two consecutive weeks, as happened on the Bulgarian Lottery in 2009. So, if you wait around long enough, it looks like you'll get to see almost anything happen. But not a man being struck by lightning twice in succession, seen on a security camera. The video of that, which Hand showed as part of a talk to the Royal Statistical Society on Thursday, is widely described on the internet as having been a fake. Maybe we'll have to wait a bit longer to see that.

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers Quora User , Trust me, I'm an engineer. Answered Aug 20, 2015 We’ve all heard the reality check before: “You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery. The odds of being struck by lightning, however, are not as simple as we would like them to be. The answer to the question, “What are the odds of being struck by lightning?” is actually, “It depends.” What is the origin of this "one million" number? US population is around 300.000.000 and you can find that the number of injuries due to lightnings is around 300 in average in the US which leads us to this 1 in a million if you live in the US.. What’s particularly noteworthy is that depending on which state you’re in within the United States, your odds of being struck by lightning this year can be much higher or much lower than that 1 in a million figure mentioned above. This map holds for the US again and shows the zone you have more risk to be hit: Clearly, the odds of being struck by lightning are not the same for everyone, everywhere, but why?  We face varying odds of being struck by lightning because of a few key factors. These essentially location-specific factors include: Cloud-to-ground lightning density rates, population size, indoor vs. outdoor activity setting and safety adherence. Indeed, a parameter which sounds obvious is the time you spend outdoor.  More time spent outdoors increases the odds of being struck by lightning. In places where people work and engage in more activities outdoors, the odds of being struck by lightning tend to be higher. Something that has strucked me when I did my researches on the topic is how the lightning safety has evolved the last decades. Prevention seems to be the key to reduce the number of deaths due to storms (about 10% of people, or 1 in 10, struck by lightning are killed). See how there has been an overall decline in lightning fatalities in the U.S. since 1940, largely due to the impact of public education efforts and increased public recognition of the value of following safety principles. I'll finish by giving some numbers: Males accounted for 81% of lightning fatalities. More than 70% of lightning deaths occurred in the months of June, July and August. Slightly more lightning deaths happened on Saturdays and Sundays than other days of the week. Individuals in the age range of 10-60 comprised the greatest number of lightning fatalities, with the 20-29 age bracket having the highest concentration of lightning fatalities. 64% of lightning deaths were related to leisure activities, followed by 17% of lightning deaths related to daily routine and 15% related to work. I feel that you are already asking yourself the same question that I asked myself: why the **** are men the main targets??!? As much as we were hoping to uncover a biological cause—extra iron in the male cranium, perhaps, or the conductive properties of testosterone—it turns out men are... just kind of stupid. "Men take more risks in lightning storms," says John Jensenius, a lightning safety expert with the National Weather Service. For men, Todd says, the risk of getting struck by lightning could be outweighed by the reward of proving to other men—and potential female mates—that they're not afraid of getting struck by lightning. This is particularly true for young men, who have the most to gain by impressing others, thereby raising their status as attractive, daring, healthy mates in the dating pool. And then, zap! In conclusion, if you're a man, not that clever, and you play baseball during the hot weekends of August, then get cover!! 2.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Samarth Singh (Sam) , Commercial Pilot - King Air B200 / 350 Updated Dec 16, 2015 · Author has 208 answers and 527.3k answer views This might scare you. Lightning strikes aircraft all the time, very often. Odds are you've already been in an aircraft that has been struck by lightning. Some reports claim every active aircraft in the world gets struck by lightning once in a year on average. The good news, however, is that a negligible number of these lightning strikes raise any concern at all. Lets explain. Modern airliners are basically made of aluminum. Most of the outer casing, the skin of the fuselage is aluminum which is an extremely good conductor of electricity. Post the 1960s which is when the last set of catastrophic lightning strikes were reported, engineers and researchers have learnt a lot and found that preparing an aircraft for lightning strikes is not all that difficult. A modern airliner has 2 major areas of concern. A spark anywhere near the fuel, and the lightning affecting avionics and instrumentation since a modern airlines like a 737 or a 320 carry a lot of electronics and computers on board. In most cases, an aircraft flying through a thunderstorm causes lightning to pass through it since it makes for an excellent conductor between the positively and negatively charged parts of a cloud cell. When this happens, lightning enters through a single point on the aircraft, perhaps the nose, or the top of a wing or the top of the tail and exits through a similar surface. For the split second that lightning passes through the craft, it conducts across the entire outer casing (fuselage skin). Some passengers and pilots have reported a large flash, some a large bang and some absolutely nothing while an aircraft is struck. Pilots often report a split second confusion in the instrumentation, most obvious being the magnetic compass dancing. The fact of the matter is that scientists have managed to keep the electricity passing through an aircraft very well contained on the outside, so it's hardly a concern anymore. The fuel system is well isolated from the atmosphere, so are the passengers and the instrumentation. The nose of the aircraft is of significant concern when protecting it against a lightning strike because it is one of the most probable areas an aircraft may get struck. Also, it houses the AWR (Airborne Weather Radar) which cannot be concealed or covered to protect it. So scientists have devised various effective ways to deflect lightning off the nose of the aircraft and over to the rest of the fuselage. With airliners now being constructed of better, lighter and less conductive composites, like the 787 dreamliners, lightning is slowly dwindling as a concern to modern aviation. I hope this answer helps. :) 8.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question Quora User , I like cheese :) Answered Jul 23, 2017 tl:dr : The probability that a plane will get struck by lightning in a given trip is between 1/2400 and 1/1200, so between 0.0004167 and 0.0008333 . However, the last time people died from lightning striking a plane was 1967, which was half a century ago and before a lot of newfangled regulations that help keep people safe (like making lightning wicks required). . Planes are very safe. Planes fly through lots of bad weather, and they are designed to be struck by lightning. Don’t worry about it. Like I said, the last time anyone died from this was in 1967, when lightning hit the fuel tank of the airplane (← click on the link for more info). 2. OK, now for math. According to Scientific American , on average, “each airplane in the U.S. commercial fleet is struck lightly by lightning more than once each year”. I don’t know where they got that, but let’s roll with it. In 2016, the FFA recorded 16,054,495 flights, and 6,676 commercial aircraft, so about 2400 flights per aircraft annually. If each aircraft gets struck by lightning once or twice a year, the odds of an aircraft being struck by lightning are between 0.0004167 and 0.0008333 . That’s literally less than one in a thousand at the worst, and half that at the best. .

No, the fact that you have been hit does not make you a more likely target for another hit. But a bit yes, because being hit by lightning often happens to people that have occupations that expose them to the weather, in locations where lightning happens more often. And such people keep that danger around them. That is why you hear stories about people that have been hit more than once. 14.8k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers Quora User , Eclectineer Answered May 1, 2014 The chance (really the probability) of lightning striking the same place, or more importantly - the same object, twice or more can be higher than you'd think. Now, probability theory isn't my thing but I like to think common sense is. Common sense dictates that the exact circumstances that produce lightning bolt 'X' once are absolutely unique - and I am talking about 'butterfly effect' levels of particle and field interaction, here. That being said, the variables that assisted 'X' in initially occurring may be similarly generated on innumerable occasions, and in the cases of natural environs may have been likewise reoccurring for millenia. Using common sense as our guide we look at deliberate functions of structures that have 'built-ins' for lightning to find them attractive - such as, very obviously, lightning rods (conductors protruding from the highest points but directly 'shorted' to earth with enough material density to carry a lightning strike). Ships and boats have them to carry lightning straight to water during a storm as they are usually higher than waves Secondarily, a building may have a mass of such density so that lightning finds it represents a shorter path to ground. Don't forget, Dr Frankenstein regularly harvested lightning for his reanimation experiments. Where I lived at Bucketty, NSW, Australia there was so much ironstone in the sandstone of the hills we were regularly without power after lightning strikes so it is more than likely any environment can be naturally or artificially created to repeatedly attract lightning so long as it represents a path of least resistance. 1.6k Views Thank you for your feedback!

Lightning does not strike randomly or independently, it takes the path of least resistance, which doesn't change much between storms. For example, lightning typically strikes the top of the empire state building 100 times a year, often multiple times during the same storm. Also, independence would mean that the probability it happens twice is equal to the square of the probability it happens once. If the probability it happened twice was equal to the probability it occurred at all, the events would be completely dependent. (It would also mean lightning never strikes only once.) 5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?

Rather obvious examples such as the Empire State Building or the Sears Tower gets struck thousands of times.  So, multiple strikes are 100% assured to occur.

Bottom: US map showing location of Virginia, which has a relatively high lightning rate. The odds of being struck by lightning for a person over the period of 80 years have been roughly estimated as 1:10000. [9] If the lightning strikes were independent events, the probability of being hit seven times would be 1:100007 = 1:1028. These numbers do not quite apply to Sullivan, however, who by the nature of his work was more exposed to storms than the average person. Virginia, where he lived, averages 35 to 45 thunderstorm days per year, most of which fall in June, July, and August. Between 1959 and 2000 lightning killed 58 people and injured at least 238 people in Virginia. In the United States, 3239 people were killed and 13,057 injured by lightning in the same period. Most of those were males between 20 and 40 years old caught outdoors.

Click here to get 30 days free!      We’ve all heard the reality check before: “You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery.”  To most of us, the odds of being struck by lightning, “ 1 in a million ,” are a convenient measuring rod for all things unlikely. Whether it’s winning the lottery or dying in a plane crash, if something is less likely to happen to you than being struck by lightning, then, as the logic goes, it’s probably not worth holding your breath for or worrying about very much (discussions along these very lines can be found here and here ).    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT       Lightning Odds…Not So Simple…  The odds of being struck by lightning, however, are not as simple as we would have them to be. The answer to the question, “What are the odds of being struck by lightning?” is actually, “It depends.”    The Numbers Behind '1 in a Million' That the odds of being struck by lightning are approximately 1 in a million is perhaps one of the most well-known statistics out there. This statistic is nonetheless, an average of the odds of being struck by lightning in the United States. According to the U.S. National Weather Service, this statistic is based on averages of reported lightning deaths and injuries along a U.S. population estimate: Estimated U.S. population as of 2011: 310,000,000 Average Annual Reported U.S. Lightning Deaths and Injures, 2001-2010: 280 Odds of being struck by lightning in a given year  (reported deaths + injuries) =1 in (310,000,000/280) = 1 in 1,107,143 =  Approximately 1 in a million  What’s particularly noteworthy is that depending on which state you’re in within the United States, your odds of being struck by lightning this year can be much higher or much lower than that 1 in a million figure mentioned above. For example, based on lightning data (courtesy StruckByLightning.org ) and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for 2011 presented in the map below, if you live in Montana, your odds of being struck by lightning are roughly 1 in 249,550, considerably higher than the the national average of 1 in a million. Towards the other end of the spectrum, in California, your odds of being struck by lightning are far lower at 1 in 7,538,382.  Lightning Map The Odds of Being Struck By Lightning, By State Click on this map to see the odds of being struck by lightning in your state (based on 2011 lightning data).  Clearly, the odds of being struck by lightning are not the same for everyone, everywhere, but why?  We face varying odds of being struck by lightning because of a few key factors. These essentially location-specific factors include: Cloud-to-ground lightning density rates, population size, indoor vs. outdoor activity setting and safety adherence. Now Available on Amazon  Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities by Jeffrey Rosenthal From terrorist attacks to big money jackpots, Struck by Lightning  deconstructs the odds and oddities of chance, examining both the relevant and irreverent role of randomness in our everyday lives..airplanes crash, bridges collapse, and we never know if we’ll be that one in a million statistic. A basic understanding of the rules of probability theory, applied to real-life circumstances, can help us to make sense of these situations, to avoid unnecessary fear, to seize the opportunities that randomness presents to us, and to actually enjoy the uncertainties we face. In this entertaining yet sophisticated look at the world of probabilities, author Jeffrey Rosenthal–an improbably talented math professor–explains the mechanics of randomness and teaches us how to develop an informed perspective on probability. U.S. Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Density This Vaisala National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) map shows the average annual lightning flash density within the continental U.S. from 1997-2011. In terms of cloud-to-ground lightning averages, Florida ranks highest, with an average of 1,414,284 flashes per year (24.7 flashes per square mile). Historically, Florida has also experienced the highest lightning number of lightning deaths in the United States, with 425 deaths occurring there from 1950-2003. Washington has the lowest cloud-to-ground lightning averages, 20,510 flashes per year (0.3 flashes per square mile). Population State population plays in a key role in determining your odds of being struck by lightning. Florida tops all the states both in terms of cloud-to-ground lightning density and the number of lightning casualties reported annually (31 in 2011), but because of Florida’s population size, an estimated 19,057,542 for 2011, the odds of being struck by lightning there were 1 in 614,759. These odds are lower  than Montana’s 1 in 249,550, even though Montana had only 4 lightning casualties, because in comparison, Montana’s estimated 2011 population was much smaller: 998,199. Indoor vs. Outdoor Simply put, more time spent outdoors increases the odds of being struck by lightning. In places where people work and engage in more activities outdoors, the odds of being struck by lightning tend to be higher. Lightning Fatalities: What Are the Odds of Being Killed by Lightning? According to U.S. NWS Storm Data for the 30 year period spanning the years 1984-2013, about 10% of people, or 1 in 10, struck by lightning are killed  . A recent report, A Detailed Analysis of Lightning Deaths in the United States from 2006 through 2013 , by lightning safety specialist, John S. Jensenius, Jr. at the National Weather Service, NOAA, revealed the following insights into lightning deaths:    Males accounted for 81% of lightning fatalities.  More than 70% of lightning deaths occurred in the months of June, July and August.  Slightly more lightning deaths happened on Saturdays and Sundays than other days of the week.  Individuals in the age range of 10-60 comprised the greatest number of lightning fatalities, with the 20-29 age bracket having the highest concentration of lightning fatalities.  64% of lightning deaths were related to leisure activities, followed by 17% of lightning deaths related to daily routine and 15% related to work.   Did You Know? As discussed in a USA Today article by Doyle Rice, there has been an overall decline in lightning fatalities in the U.S. since 1940, largely due to the impact of public education efforts and increased public recognition of the value of following safety principles.  Lightning Safety The U.S. National Weather Service cautions that when there is a thunderstorm in the area, no place outside that is safe. Moreover, if you can hear thunder, that means that lightning is, in fact, close enough to strike you . If you are outdoors when you hear thunder, seek safe shelter. In short, when it comes to lightning, the message that lightning experts and organizations regard as being the most crucial is to go indoors when there is a thunderstorm in the area. Thus, the National Weather Service , StruckByLighting.org and others have worked hard to get the simple message out: “ When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors!” Featured Image Credit: Brilhasti1/Flickr     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Email Print    Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

By Laura Albert     There is not nearly enough information available on the Internet on the conditional probability of being struck by lightning.  I think of the odds of being struck by lightning and conditional probability every time I am in a thunderstorm. The conditional probability of being struck by lightning is probably not 1 in 6. NOAA estimates that the (unconditional) probability of being struck by lightning is ~1 in 1,000,000 per year and ~1 in 10,000 over a lifetime. That’s of little solace when I’m out running a few miles from home when a thunderstorm rolls in.  Jeffrey Seth Rosenthal’s book Struck by Lightning does not exactly answer this question. He does, however, report the annual probability of being struck by lightning conditioned on where on lives. Below are the figures from his book on the most dangerous states, the safest states, and the most dangerous countries (at least in terms of being struck by lightning). The “Annual Rates” report the expected number of people struck by lightning per year per 100,000. This could be due to differences in the prior probabilities (some areas have more thunderstorms than others) or in attitudes toward risk in thunderstorms.     Any idea of what the conditional probability of being struck by lightning would be given that one is outside in a thunderstorm? I need to know how much to panic the next time a thunderstorm rolls in when I am running.  There is a part II , part III , and part IV to this series.

Our fatality rate is lower than in the US.  Also the statistics show that about five times as many men die as women.  See http://www.torro.org.uk/site/lightning_info.php But, as for: Prob(Laura is hit by lightning before she reaches home | Laura is running miles from home AND there is a thunderstorm) all I can say is it is in the range 0 < p < 1 without equality.              S. Phil Kim (@ksphil)    February 9th, 2012 at 10:00 am    The answer is all about how often people is outside when there is a thunderstorm. Of cause, I am assuming that all the event lightening strike happen outside.  If we can get the data from survey “how many times have you been outside in a thunderstorm a year?”(xi for i th person). Then 45 / Sum(xi) i \in population of American will be the Conditional probability of being stuck by lightening. Let’s say, an average American have been outside in a thunderstorm 0.5 times per year. then, 90/7million is the answer. But, how long should one be outside to be considered as been outside ?  If we consider the time expose to the thunderstorm, it would be more precise. Assuming the event happen as poisson process, we will need to estimate the rate and then we can calculate the probability if one is outside in a thunderstorm for an hour, for example. This case we need to know an average hour people spend outside in a thunderstorm.  Anyway, the portability will go up significantly, because I think most of people will not stay outside when there is a thunderstorm.              Paul A. Rubin    February 9th, 2012 at 5:02 pm    First, the death rate its higher for men because men will continue to play golf (raising metal clubs) during a t-storm. Second, I’ve actually heard of indoor”lightning”, but the story its too long to fit here. Third, in addition to time of exposure, Laura would need to factor in terrain (trees, presence of metal above our below the surface) and the fact that she has above average height. (A lazy lightning bolt will take her before it takes me … unless I’m swinging a golf club.)              Michael C. Grant    February 9th, 2012 at 6:52 pm    I wonder if the metal in my leg reduces my resistance to ground. 😛             Laura McLay   February 9th, 2012 at 8:24 pm    Thoughts from my husband:  why not ask the question this way: what is the probability that a given thunderstorm will injure or kill someone? I googled some stats, and found that the NWS estimates 100000 thunderstorms in the U.S. per year:  http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0052833/m0052833.asp#head002000000000000  The same source quotes about 100 deaths per year, and 257 lightning related injuries per year.  More recent data indicates that the fatalities have been declining to 55 per year averaged 1980-2009:  http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/fatalities.htm  Assume that most incidents are individuals and not groups (seems valid given the tabular data from 2011), for any given storm P(death) = 55/100000 and P(injury) = 257/100000. Of course this is just a rough estimate, and perhaps with better data you could make estimates for geographic regions or specific time of year. Note that the NOAA link indicates that 73% (40/55) of deaths occur in the summer months, but then I’d expect that the majority of thunderstorms also occur in those months.              Jeffrey W. Herrmann    February 10th, 2012 at 8:31 am    I agree that the rates based on where one lives are not relevant to the conditional probability that we’re discussing; the rates above reflect the differences in thunderstorm frequency, the number of people who work and play outside, and other factors.

I went to high school with someone who was struck by lightning and lived, so I am well aware of this. Your advice to stand on one leg is consistent with other advice I have heard about how to position the arms. I think that these poses do not encourage the lightning to cross the chest, which would cause the heart to stop beating. But I’m not a real doctor.             Laura McLay   February 13th, 2012 at 8:55 am    Jeffrey: no offense taken! Thanks for your clarification. The tables do not display exactly what I would like them to, but they are the best that I have. They are, I think, useful for starting to unpack the impact of the frequency of lightning, the odds that people are outside in storms, and the impact of infrastructure in lowering the conditional probability. For example, the high rate in Cuba could reflect more manual laborers who remain outside in a storm? Or are the different building codes in different countries indirectly factoring into different conditional probabilities? I’m relying on the collective wisdom of my readers here.
