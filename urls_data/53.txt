Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown.

Eye Colors Around the World: How Rare is Your Eye Color?   June 9, 2017 What's In Style      79   0        0               Eyes are such a unique characteristic that people have. Eyes range in different colors, some that are very common and some that are quite rare. Here are some of the most common and rarest eye colors found around the world.  Brown Eyes  With brown-eye people making up more than 55% of the global population, brown eyes are the most common eye color amongst people. In fact, nearly all members of the African and Asian population share brown eyes. This is because of it being a dominant genetic trait due to melanin existing in the eye.  Blue Eyes  While brown eyes are genetically dominant, blue eye color is recessive genetic trait, which makes them much less common amongst people. Blue eye color exists because there is an absence of pigments, and blue eyes appear from the scattered light reflected off of the iris. Although less common than brown eyes, about 8% of people in the world have blue eyes. They can often be found in people in northern Europe.  Hazel Eyes  While hazel eyes have similarities to brown eyes, they are usually a lighter color with more of a green and yellow tint. Hazel eyes are created because there is higher concentrated melanin around the border of the pupil than the rest of the iris. This results in the appearance of a multi-colored iris that ranges from copper to green in certain lights. Approximately 5-8% of people in the world have hazel eyes.  Green Eyes  Green eyes can often be mistaken for hazel eyes, but they are two completely different eye colors. In addition, green eyes are one of the rarest eye colors found worldwide with only 2% of people having green eyes. Green eyes occur because of a mild amount of melanin, a burst a lipochrome, and a golden tint. The golden tint mixes with a natural base of blue to create the green color. Green eye people most frequently live in northern and central Europe, but western Asia can also be a place where it is found.  Silver Eyes  Often, silver colored eyes are considered to be a variation of blue eyes. However, they are a rare eye color that still look distinct from blue eyes. Like blue colored eyes, silver is created due to low pigmentation in the eyes. Though quite rare, silver eyes can be found most frequently in eastern Europe.  Black Eyes  Although there are some people with eyes as dark as night, this is not true black. It is actually just extremely dark brown. This happens because of a significantly higher concentration of melanin throughout the iris. Often with this eye color, it is even difficult to distinguish between the pupil and the iris.  Red or Pink Eyes  Red or pink colored eyes can be a result of albinism or blood leaking into the iris. Albino people often have extremely light blue eye from lack of pigmentation, but certain forms of albinism causes a red or pink eye color instead.  Amber Eyes  Amber colored eyes are a very rare find around the world, but they are most common in Asia and South America. This eye color can vary from a golden yellow to more of a copper color. While amber eyes are frequently confused with hazel eyes, the difference is that hazel has brown and green while amber is a single color. The high amount of lipochrome gives the appearance of glowing eyes. This eye color is found more in animals than in humans.  Violet Eyes  This is another rare eye color typically found in people with albinism. In fact, it is believed that truly violet eyes cannot exist with having albinism. Violet eyes occurs from mixing lack of pigment and red from light reflecting off of blood vessels within the eyes.  While not all of us have these eye colors, you can still make your pair look good with our glasses!

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this simple model .  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.  The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).  New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.  The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:   The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.  Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.  So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.  And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.  Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!  So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.                             Carrying a Dominant Trait               Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.  People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.  These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.  HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:    These different combinations give the following eye colors:    Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.  But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:    The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:    Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:    The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:    Here are the rest of the possibilities:    Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.  Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!  And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:    All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  (Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)  Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.                She could be carrying a brown eye gene!               Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other               Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click here to learn why no pigment gives blue.)  OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.  Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.  If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.  Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!  Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.  This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.  Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:    When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.  This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.  So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.  The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.   OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked  An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.  Imagine these parents:    If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:   The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.  Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:   Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.  Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called recombination .  That is a story for another day…     By Dr. Barry Starr, Stanford University                                                                                                               The Tech Museum of Innovation 201 South Market Street San Jose, CA 95113 +1 (408) 294-8324  The Tech Museum of Innovation 2013 © All rights reserved.

Your eye color fully matures in infancy. From this early age, you’ll have naturally brown, blue, hazel, green, or gray eyes for the rest of your life. Some people wear colored contacts to enhance the intensity or change the color of their eyes. Others go to more extreme measures.  A new controversial surgical procedure that permanently changes eye color is gaining traction. The practice, popular among celebrities, uses an artificial iris to drastically alter your eye color in a matter of minutes. Many doctors warn that this technique can lead to severe eye damage.  Temporary Temporarily changing your eye color   The easiest and most common way to change your eye color temporarily is to wear contact lenses. You can go from a deep brown to a light hazel eye in a matter of seconds (or minutes, depending how long it takes you to get the contacts in).  Colored contact lenses come in three tints:  Opaque: Opaque-tint lenses are solid and non-transparent, offering a complete color change. This type of tint works best for people with dark eyes who want to go dramatically lighter, such as going from dark brown to ice gray.  The most popular opaque colors include:  blue hazel green violet gray amethyst brown  Enhancement: Enhancement-tint contact lenses boost your natural eye color. These types of lenses are transparent and solid in color. They help define the edges of your iris and add intensity to your eye color. If, for example, you have jade-green eyes and want to alter them to emerald, enhancement lenses would work well.  Visibility: Visibility-tint contact lenses don't actually change your eye color. These lenses have faint flecks of light blue or green, which can accentuate your natural eye color.  Be aware: Decorative contact lenses  Decorative lenses, or plano contacts, are often used as fashion or costume accessories, especially during Halloween. For example, you can create cat eyes and white irises using plano contacts.  You can buy decorative lenses in stores or online, but the American Optometric Association recommends getting a prescription first. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists all contact lenses as medical devices , which means you need a valid prescription in order to purchase them.  Decorative lenses carry the same health risks as corrective lenses when used incorrectly. If you buy corrective or plano contacts without a prescription, or buy lenses that aren’t approved by the FDA, you run the chance of getting defective or unsanitary lenses.  This can increase your risk of:  blurry vision vision loss itchy, watery eyes and other allergic reactions corneal abrasion (a scratch on the outer layer of the eye) blindness  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after wearing contact lenses:  eye redness persistent eye pain discharge from your eyes slight vision loss  These may be symptoms of an eye infection. An untreated eye infection can become severe and possibly lead to blindness.  Learn more: Chronic dry eye and contact lenses »  Permanent Can you change your eye color permanently?   Iris implant surgery was first developed to treat traumatic eye injuries and medical conditions. These include aniridia, when the entire iris is missing, and coloboma, when part of the iris is missing.  During this procedure, the doctor makes a small incision in the cornea and inserts a silicone-based artificial iris, folded to fit into the slit. They then unfold the artificial iris underneath the cornea so that it covers the natural iris. Typically, they’ll use a local anesthetic.  Despite its medical purposes, the procedure has become increasingly popular for cosmetic reasons. Many people opt to undergo surgery to change their eye color, even though their natural iris functions normally.  Research shows that people who have had cosmetic iris implant surgery are more likely to experience complications.  This includes:  some vision loss or blindness glaucoma from the elevated pressure inside the eye cataracts , which occur when the clear lens of the eye becomes clouded cornea injury swelling of the cornea, known as corneal edema uveitis , a form of eye inflammation that leads to redness, pain, and blurred vision  Cosmetic iris implant surgery is a relatively new and controversial practice that has yet to be scrutinized fully by medical researchers. There is little to no evidence proving the procedure is effective and safe. The procedure hasn’t been evaluated by a regulatory agency in the United States, nor has it undergone clinical trials. Because of this, people must travel overseas to get this surgery.  Another controversial practice to permanently change your eye color from brown to blue includes the use of a low-energy laser. This laser removes pigment from the layer of interlaced tissue in the iris, known as the stroma. Gregg Homer, a scientist who founded the Stroma Medical Corporation in 2009, developed this technique. It’s not yet available to the general public. According to Stroma's website , this procedure is currently undergoing clinical trials.  Eye color over time Can eye color change over time?   The short answer: no. The pigment melanin determines your eye color. Eyes with a lot of melanin will be naturally darker. The less melanin in your eyes, the lighter they'll be.  For the most part, your eye color will stay the same from infancy. Research has found that eye color can change in rare cases due to injury or genetics.  Some people have two different colored irises from a condition called heterochromia. This condition is often caused by injury or trauma to the eye. Rarely, it may be caused by a birth defect such as Waardenburg syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, congenital Horner’s syndrome, or Parry-Romberg syndrome.  Pigmentary glaucoma may also affect your eye color. This is a type of inborn open-angle glaucoma that can develop during your 20s or 30s.  Some people have claimed that bathing your eye in a mixture of pure honey and lukewarm water will change its color over time. There's no scientific evidence supporting this. In fact, it's very unlikely because the mixture wouldn’t be able to penetrate the cornea to get to your iris. So while honey can help ease inflammation and treat dry eye , it won't change your eye color.  Takeaway The bottom line   The American Academy of Ophthalmology came out against cosmetic iris implant surgery in 2014. The organization warned that the procedure could lead to severe eye complications, including vision loss and blindness. Many ophthalmologists agree and have panned the surgery over the last few years. Although the procedure may be popular among celebrities, that doesn't mean it's actually safe in the long run.  If you want to change your eye color, opt for a non-invasive, temporary change, such as using tinted contacts. Wearing prescription or decorative contacts may come with some risks, but contacts can be far safer than going under the knife.

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

Please Share!   Human eye color charts once were used to "predict" eye colors of children.  In the most simplified versions of these charts, brown eyes are considered dominant over both blue and green eyes. And green eyes are thought to be dominant over blue eyes .  While these concepts generally are true, the genetics of how eye colors are inherited turn out to be far more complicated than once thought.  You can't simply determine the eye colors of grandparents and parents, then calculate the odds of what color a baby's eyes will be. In fact, you can belong to a family with many generations of brown-eyed individuals and still end up with green or blue eyes.    Eye Color Facts                 Contrary to popular belief, it's also possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.  Eye colors depend on the amount of pigment (melanin) found in the iris and how it is distributed. Light gray-blue eyes contain much less pigment than extremely dark brown eyes. And there are many shades of eye color in between.  SEE ALSO:  What Determines Hazel Eye Color >  Some people are even born with eyes of two different colors, a condition known as heterochromia .

Obviously, the percentage of dark brown eyes found in Asian and African populations will be much higher than in European populations.  And some day, blue may be a rare eye color. This is because more people now select mates outside usual cultural and ethic groups. So when a brown-eyed person marries someone with blue eyes, offspring are more likely to inherit the more dominant brown eyes.

How it works           The determination of the eye color of an individual is a complex and fascinating phenomenon, especially when the birth of a new child approaches.  What color would my child's eyes be?  What are his chances of having brown, blue or green eyes?  The following answers are simplified explanations, the determination of the eye color of an individual depends on much more parameters than those cited below.  This method of calculation takes into account only three theoretical eye colors: brown, green and blue.
					
					The results given by this calculator are an estimate of the chance of having a child with the eyes of one of these three colors.  Two principal genes are detected as determinants for eye color: EYCL3 (localized on chromosome 15) and EYCL1 (localized on chromosome 19).
					
					The EYCL3 gene determines the amount of melanin present in our eye color, light eyes or dark eyes. Its value can be: B (Brown) or b (blue).					
					The EYCL1 gene determines the blue color or green color of our eyes.
					Its value may be: G (Green) or b (blue).  On each chromosome, we have two different alleles that come from our mother AND our father.  These genes have a dominance / recessivity ratio between them, that is, some genes will override others. The B gene is dominant on the b gene, and the G gene is dominant on the b gene. The b gene is always recessive.  For example, an individual with brown eyes may have the combination:  Chromosome 15 (EYCL3 gene): Allele 1 => B, allele 2 => b, dominant gene => B Chromosome 19 (EYCL1 gene): Allele 1 => b, allele 2 => b, dominant gene => b The color determined by the EYCL1 gene is blue, but that determined by the EYCL3 gene is brown.
					
					Finally, this individual would have brown eyes because the gene EYCL3 (having value B) will be dominant on the EYCL1 gene (having value b).  The notion of "undefined" color corresponds to an individual whose eye color is unknown. This means that he can possess one of the sixteen possible combinations that can determine the color of his eyes.  Of the sixteen possible combinations: twelve correspond to the brown color, three to the green color, and one to the blue color.  Here are the sixteen possible combinations:  BB GG => BROWN BB Gb => BROWN BB bG => BROWN BB bb => BROWN Bb GG => BROWN Bb Gb => BROWN Bb bG => BROWN Bb bb => BROWN BB GG => BROWN BB Gb => BROWN BB bG => BROWN BB bb => BROWN Bb GG => GREEN Bb Gb => GREEN Bb bG => GREEN Bb bb => BLUE   When we know the color of an individual's eyes, we can determine the possible combinations corresponding to him.
The chromosomes of baby will be made up of one or the other of the alleles of each of the parents.  We can therefore calculate all the possible combinations determined by the eye color of each parent.  For example:  - For two parents with brown eyes, the number of possible combinations is 331776 !!! - For two parents with blue eyes, the number of possible combinations is now only 16 (but all equal to "bb bb").  Using this method of calculation, we find that two parents with blue eyes and / or green eyes can not have a child with brown eyes. Whereas in reality this could happen! Even if the possibilities are minimal, they prove the limits of this method of calculation.  It is for this reason that the calculator is "rigged" when the final result is displayed, in the event that both parents have green and or blue eyes, to indicate a minimum percentage of chance that the child could have brown eyes.           Frequently asked questions             What are the different elements that make up the eye?   The eye is an organ that detects light and is the basis of the sense of sight. Its function is to convert light energy into electrical signals that are sent to the brain through the optic nerve. The human eye works in a very similar manner to that of most vertebrates and some molluscs.  It is made up of :    Of a lens, which is adjustable according to the distance;  Of a "diaphragm", called pupil, whose diameter is regulated by the iris;  And a light-sensitive tissue, which is the retina..    The light penetrates through the pupil, passes through the lens and is projected on the retina, where it is transformed, thanks to cells called photoreceptors, into nerve impulses that will be transported via the optic nerve to reach the brain.     Does the color of the eyes change with age?   The color or tint of the eyes of a human being changes very little during our existence, except during the first days of our lives when the color of our baby's eyes is not yet completely determined.  But some diseases, or serious accidents can slightly transform the color of our eyes.  Another cause of an individual's eye color change is the fact that some have an iris or melanin is not uniformly distributed, resulting in an iris of many colors. According to various external changes (such as sunlight), or physiological (blood pressure), the color perceived by people watching you may differ.     Can we change the color of his eyes?   The color of the eyes depends on the type and amount of pigment the iris has. This pigment, called melanin, is a natural eye protection against ultraviolet rays.  During the evolution of the human species, over the centuries, a greater amount of melanin has developed in the sunnier areas (brown eyes, black eyes, brown eyes) and less melanin (gray eyes, blue eyes, green eyes) in the less luminous areas.  Many people, for aesthetic reasons, want to change the color of their eyes and the only way is the use of cosmetic contact lenses which, if they are well adapted, is a safe method.     What is the percentage of people with brown, green or blue eyes?   The distribution of the color of the eyes of human beings on our planet is far from homogeneous. This distribution varies enormously according to the geographical areas and ethnic groups represented.  The eye colors vary from blue, green brown, amber, brown, almost black, gray or even multicolored! But we can classify them into three main categories: blue, green and brown.  The most represented color in the world is the brown color, with about 75% of the world's population, then comes the color of blue eyes with about 23% and finally the color green with less than 2%.     What are the laws of Mendelian genetics?   Mendel's laws were developed by a genetic researcher, considered the father of genetics: Gregor Mendel. This scientist has conducted experiments that have elucidated the fundamental elements of heredity, an example of Mendel's law is the prediction of the traits of descendants by the characteristics of the parents of an animal or plant species.  This scientist has been inventing some of the most well known terms of genetics, such as the terms "dominant" and "recessive", which are hereditary factors present in the characteristics and hereditary traits of organisms across the three laws from Mendel. Which are: "Law of uniformity of the first generation hybrids", "Law of disjunction of the alleles" and "Law of independent segregation of the multiple hereditary characters".     Where does the color of green eyes come from?   Green eyes are the product of moderate amounts of melanin. Green is an intermediate color between brown tones and blue or gray tones.  The genes involved are EYCL1 and EYCL3. Thus, the dominant allele for EYCL1, conjugated to any allele for EYCL3, with the exception of the dominant allele of the latter, leads to the green color of the eyes. It is native to Europe and only 2% of the world's population has this eye color.     What is the origin of the color of blue eyes?   Soon after birth, many babies have blue eyes, even if their parents have brown eyes, because the melanin proteins responsible for the pigmentation of the iris have not all been released yet.  It is the variation of the levels of this pigment, associated with the effect of light interference, which gives birth to all the colors of the eyes that we know. Depending on the amount of melanin present, the eye may appear dark brown, light, nutty, green, gray or blue.  In 2008, a team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen discovered a particular genetic mutation regulating a protein needed for melanin production.  According to Hans Eiberg, who led the research, this genetic discovery suggests that all the blue-eyed people around us today are the descendants of a single human being, who would probably have lived between the ages of 6,000 and 10,000.  Eidberg argues that all people had brown eyes until this genetic mutation in the OCA2 gene triggers a process that literally "extinguishes" the ability to produce the brown color in the iris.  However, before this gene was discovered, Francis Galton was already curious about the origin of blue eye color, as Hugh Aldersey-Williams explains in his book Anatomies:  « A briefcase with sixteen numbered glass eyes of different colors was constructed. The eyes have been arranged in a sheet of molded metal so as to provide each eye with eyelids and an eyebrow, a surreal dread occurs when the briefcase is opened for the first time. Galton had to make sure that the color labels he had chosen from the "wide variety of terms" used by compilers of family registers were the most important in nature. He did not choose brown or blue, as we usually do, but categories of light and dark, dividing those with "hazel" eyes into both fields. Then he compared the children with their parents and grandparents, using abundantly their usual statistical storm, but found nothing more remarkable to say at the end of his observation is that the blue and brown eyes persist for generations. »  It seems that people with blue or green eyes are more likely to suffer from skin cancer, especially melanoma. In reality, being a person with white skin and blue eyes is an anomaly that has been produced by very specific conditions.  About 20% of the population has blue eyes. They are relatively common in Europe, with more marked areas in the Nordic and Eastern countries where the majority of the population has blue eyes.     Can we have one eye of one color and the other of another?   Yes, but it's pretty rare. Studies show that fewer than 11 out of a thousand people have different colored eyes.  This strange feature is due to several factors, and can change over time. The color of the iris develops during the first months after birth, melanin levels in the iris determine the color of the eyes. But sometimes the concentration and distribution of melanin are not uniform in both eyes, leading to a known phenomenon called heterochromia.  This anomaly can occur in different ways:   Complete heterochromia, when each eye is of a clearly different color, for example, a blue and other brown eye.  Central heterochromia, when the eyes have many colors, like a blue iris with a yellow-brown ring around the pupil.  And sectoral heterochromia, when the iris has a touch of color different from its general tone.  Alterations in eye pigmentation are not necessarily indicative of an underlying medical problem, but are the common features of many hereditary genetic disorders. But sometimes the formation of tumors inside the eye can cause heterochromia.     Why do babies have blue eyes at birth?   The color of the eye is due to the amount of melanin that the iris contains. It is a protein secreted by melanocytes that stain the iris, hair and skin.  In the newborn, the melanin-producing cells, the melanocytes, are still immature and produce melanin in small amounts. Over the months, this melanin production increases and darkens the skin, hair and eyes. There is a popular belief, which links the light color of the baby's eyes to the duration of breastfeeding. In other words, some people think that the light color of the baby's eyes is caused by breastfeeding. In fact, there is no scientific basis for this belief. The average duration of breastfeeding being 6 to 9 months, this could coincide with the darkening of the eyes of a baby depending on the maturation of melanocytes. But there appears to be a relationship between sun exposure and activation of melanin production by melanocytes. In some adults, the color of their eyes has changed as a function of their exposure to the sun. But the final color of a baby's eyes is defined genetically even though some external factors such as light are likely to influence it. After birth, if the melanocytes secrete a small amount of melanin, the baby will have blue eyes. If this amount is a bit higher, the baby's eyes will be green, honey or hazel. And if the secretion of melanin is greater, the baby's eyes will be brown, dark brown or black.     Can a blue-eyed mother and father have a brown-eyed baby?      Can two parents with brown eyes have a baby with blue eyes?      What are all the colors of the existing eyes?      What is the rarest eye color?

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this simple model .  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.  The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).  New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.  The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:   The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.  Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.  So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.  And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.  Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!  So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.                             Carrying a Dominant Trait               Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.  People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.  These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.  HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:    These different combinations give the following eye colors:    Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.  But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:    The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:    Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:    The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:    Here are the rest of the possibilities:    Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.  Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!  And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:    All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  (Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)  Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.                She could be carrying a brown eye gene!               Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other               Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click here to learn why no pigment gives blue.)  OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.  Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.  If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.  Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!  Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.  This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.  Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:    When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.  This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.  So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.  The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.   OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked  An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.  Imagine these parents:    If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:   The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.  Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:   Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.  Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called recombination .  That is a story for another day…     By Dr. Barry Starr, Stanford University                                                                                                               The Tech Museum of Innovation 201 South Market Street San Jose, CA 95113 +1 (408) 294-8324  The Tech Museum of Innovation 2013 © All rights reserved.

Dominant vs. Recessive          Back to Dominant vs. Recessive           English   Español       Which parent gives you the most dominant genes?        -An undergraduate from Indiana   October 12, 2011  Except for a few special cases (see below), it doesn't really matter which parent gave you which gene. If a gene version is dominant, it will dominate whether it came from mom or dad.  So your chances of getting a dominant trait don't depend on which parent it came from. If mom gives you the dominant brown eye version of an eye color gene, odds are you'll end up with brown eyes. Same thing if dad passes the same gene. In neither case would you have higher odds for getting brown eyes.  Now that isn't to say that if mom has brown eyes then all her kids will too. They could end up with the other parent's recessive blue or green eyes. Or an eye color that neither parent has!  This is how brown-eyed parents end up with a blue-eyed child. Or how two parents who don't have red hair have a redheaded baby.  As you can see, genetics is a complicated business. But one thing we do know...no one is more likely to favor one parent over the other. Which traits you get depend on the combination of genes you get from both parents.  What I'll do for the rest of the answer is explain a bit about how genes work. Then I'll focus on some situations where the parents do matter. As you'll see, this is usually when a trait is on the X chromosome.   Dominant and Recessive  Let's say that a child has a mom with brown eyes and dad with blue eyes. Since brown eyes are dominant, the mom can have either one brown (B) and one blue (b) version of an eye color gene or she can have two browns. As geneticists like to say, she can be either Bb or BB.  To make things easier, we will say that she is BB (both genes are the brown version). Since the dad has blue eyes, he has two copies of the recessive blue version. He is bb.  Each parent will pass one copy of their eye color gene to their child. In this case, the mom will always pass B and the dad will always pass b. This means all of their kids will be Bb and have brown eyes. Each child will show the mom's dominant trait.  Now if we flip things around where the father has two brown versions (BB) and the mom has two blue ones (bb), the child will still end up Bb and having brown eyes. It doesn't matter if B came from mom or dad. It only mattered that the child got a B.  I don't want you to think that if one parent shows the dominant trait, all their children will too. They may not. Let me give another eye color example to show you what I mean.  Imagine a mom with one version of the brown and one version of the blue eye color gene. She is Bb and has brown eyes. Dad is bb and has blue eyes.  These are the same eye colors that the parents had in the first example. But the result could turn out very differently.  The kids each have a 50% chance of having mom's brown eyes and a 50% chance of having dad's blue eyes. (This is because mom has a 50% chance of passing her B and a 50% chance of passing her b.) So in this case, the kids can end up with mom's dominant trait or dad's recessive one. Which one is a simple matter of chance.*  And if we take a Bb dad (brown eyes) and a bb mother (blue eyes), there is still a 50% chance for the child to have blue eyes. Again it didn't matter which parent gave which gene version. What was important is that these two gene versions were involved.  This is true for many, many traits besides eye color. But not all of them. Sometimes it matters whether your mom or dad has a dominant trait.   Blame (or Thank) Mom Through our discussion so far, you may have picked up on the fact that we have two copies of our genes - one from mom and one from dad. But this isn't true for every gene.   Red-green colorblindness (II) is one of the few traits where it matters which parent the gene came from.  Whether you are a boy or a girl mostly depends on whether you have an X and a Y chromosome or two X's. If you have an X and a Y, then you are a boy. If you have two X's, then you are a girl.  This matters for our discussion because it means that girls (and so moms) have two copies of all the genes on the X chromosome while boys (and dads) have just one. The genes on mom's X chromosome will dominate for her sons whether they are dominant or recessive. Let's look at color blindness as an example to figure out why.  Imagine that mom is colorblind. Since being colorblind is recessive, she has two copies of the color blind version of the gene (c). Geneticists say she is Xc Xc because the recessive version is on the X chromosome.  In our case, dad isn't color blind. Since he has just one X chromosome, he has a single copy of the version of the gene that lets him tell red from green. He is XC Y. (The XC means he has the dominant version of the color vision gene on his X. The Y has no color vision gene on it and so is here as a marker.)  OK, now what happens when these two parents have sons? They are all colorblind like their mother. Her recessive trait dominates!  Let me take you through how this happened. Since the child is a boy, we know dad passed his Y (otherwise the child would be a girl). This doesn't contribute any color vision genes.  Mom will pass one of her Xc's to her son. The son now has an Xc and a Y. He has no dominant color vision gene version to overcome his color blind version and so is color blind like his mother. Every son will have that trait.  Colorblindness is one of a few special traits where it matters which parent a gene copy came from. For most traits it doesn't matter. What matters is the combination of genes you get no matter the source.  * As we talk about here , it is also possible for the child to have green, hazel or any other eye color.

A Genetic Explanation    What Color Will My Baby's Eyes Be? A Genetic Explanation      by:  Rebecca Desfosse   Blue, brown or somewhere in between? Check out some of the genetics that determine your little one's eye color.                     Are you crossing your fingers hoping for a brown-eyed baby? Or, are you wondering how on earth you ended up with blue-eyes with two parents with brown eyes? Don't worry, you weren't switched at birth and your little one could have brown eyes no matter what color her parents' eyes are. The genetics behind eye color is an extremely complex and intricate game of chance. When it comes to the question, "What color will my baby's eyes be?" the truth is that it's impossible to tell, but it's really fun to guess.  Eye Color and Melanin   Eye colors are completely fascinating. In any given group of people, you can find dozens of different shades of gray, green, hazel, blue and brown. What we call eye color is actually the color of the iris. The amount of a pigment called melanin found in your iris produces your eye color, with blue eyes being produced by the least amount of melanin and brown being produced by the most. The resulting eye color can be any and every shade in between -- all determined by a complex process of genetics.  Here's the quick lowdown: Typically, two blue-eyed parents end up with a blue-eyed child, but not always. Likewise, two brown-eyed parents are likely (but not guaranteed) to have a child with brown eyes. If one parent has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes, their child has about a 50/50 chance of either ending up with brown or blue eyes.  The Theory of Mendelian Genetics  It was originally thought that eye color was determined by a simplistic model of Mendelian genetics, meaning it was determined by a single gene, with brown eyes considered dominant and blue recessive. It has now been determined that eye color is a polygenic trait, meaning it is determined by multiple genes. According to Dr. Jennifer Stagg , a biochemist turned naturopathic physician and author of Unzip Your Genes: 5 Choices To Reveal A Radically Radiant You , "There are a number of genes that are responsible for eye color, but the two primary genes, OCA2 and HERC2 are on chromosome 15." The OCA2 gene produces a transporter of tyrosine, which produces melanin, while HERC2 regulates the OCA2 genes' expression.  Using a Punnett Square  Punnet squares aren't completely useless even with this new information. According to Dr. Stagg, "Old Mendelian Punnett squares are a fun tool to predict eye color, but we now know that charts are too simplified an approach when it comes to genetics." For example, using the Mendelian model, two parents with blue eyes wouldn't be able to have a baby with blue eyes, but we know that it is not impossible. That being said, the Punnett square does accurately predict that it is possible for two parents with brown eyes to have a blue-eyed baby. "Even with the outdated Mendelian model, if both parents each have a dominant and recessive gene for eye color, they could end up having a blue-eyed baby only if both parents pass on a recessive gene," says Dr. Stagg.  Let's explore this example further with a Punnnet square:  To make a Punnett square, you first need to create a table. Put your two possible gene versions on the top using a large B or brown, the dominant trait, and a small b for blue, the recessive trait. Add your partner's gene versions on the side of the table:    B  b  B      b      Next, fill in each square with the letters from the top and side to figure out all possible variations:    B  b  B  BB  Bb  b  Bb  Bb  As you can see, there is a one out of four chance that a child of two parents with brown eyes will have a blue-eyed baby if their parents carry the recessive gene for blue eyes. Fun right?  Eye Color at Birth  As if predicting eye color weren't confusing enough, the color eyes your baby has at birth might not stick around. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics , it takes up to one year for the melanocytes to build up to the right amount of melanin in the eyes. Most babies are born with blue eyes (remember, it's the eye color produced by the least amount of melanin), but that can quickly change to green, hazel or even brown.  If you're a pregnant mama wondering, "What color will my baby's eyes be?" try playing around with Punnett squares for fun, but remember that it's all up to chance -- and the complex mystery that is genetics.

Animated video shows the likelihood of a child's eye colour based on what their parents have  A video shows likelihood of child's eye colour based on parents Parents with green and brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes Dominant gene from parents is the determining factor of a baby's eyes By Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia   Published: 22:59 EDT, 12 May 2016 |  Updated: 23:37 EDT, 12 May 2016              e-mail          145  shares     131  View comments     Did you know if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your baby could have blue eyes? A video shared on My Child Magazine Australia 's Facebook page has crunched the numbers and shows the likelihood of  a baby having a certain eye colour based on what their parents have. For example, if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your child is 50 per cent more likely to have brown eyes, but also has a 38 per cent chance of having green eyes and a 12 per cent chance of having blue eyes. Scroll down for video          Brown eyed boy: Video shows what your baby's eye colour could be based on you and your partners eyes                      It's all in the genes: If you and your partner have green eyes, you baby is likely to have green eyes too If you have blue eyes and your partner has brown, there's a 50-50 chance your baby will have either of those colours, according to the video. While if both parents have green eyes, their baby has a 75 per cent chance of having the same colour, a 24 per cent chance of having blue eyes and a one per cent chance of having brown eyes. Eye colour is a hereditary trait from parents and determines a baby's eye colour. One eye colour can be more expressive, or dominant, than another, and can therefore dictate what a baby's eye colour will be. Brown eyes are dominant over green or blue, while green is always dominant over the recessive blue eyes gene, according to Huggies.com.au .

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful.

Eye Colors Around the World: How Rare is Your Eye Color?   June 9, 2017 What's In Style      79   0        0               Eyes are such a unique characteristic that people have. Eyes range in different colors, some that are very common and some that are quite rare. Here are some of the most common and rarest eye colors found around the world.  Brown Eyes  With brown-eye people making up more than 55% of the global population, brown eyes are the most common eye color amongst people. In fact, nearly all members of the African and Asian population share brown eyes. This is because of it being a dominant genetic trait due to melanin existing in the eye.  Blue Eyes  While brown eyes are genetically dominant, blue eye color is recessive genetic trait, which makes them much less common amongst people. Blue eye color exists because there is an absence of pigments, and blue eyes appear from the scattered light reflected off of the iris. Although less common than brown eyes, about 8% of people in the world have blue eyes. They can often be found in people in northern Europe.  Hazel Eyes  While hazel eyes have similarities to brown eyes, they are usually a lighter color with more of a green and yellow tint. Hazel eyes are created because there is higher concentrated melanin around the border of the pupil than the rest of the iris. This results in the appearance of a multi-colored iris that ranges from copper to green in certain lights. Approximately 5-8% of people in the world have hazel eyes.  Green Eyes  Green eyes can often be mistaken for hazel eyes, but they are two completely different eye colors. In addition, green eyes are one of the rarest eye colors found worldwide with only 2% of people having green eyes. Green eyes occur because of a mild amount of melanin, a burst a lipochrome, and a golden tint. The golden tint mixes with a natural base of blue to create the green color. Green eye people most frequently live in northern and central Europe, but western Asia can also be a place where it is found.  Silver Eyes  Often, silver colored eyes are considered to be a variation of blue eyes. However, they are a rare eye color that still look distinct from blue eyes. Like blue colored eyes, silver is created due to low pigmentation in the eyes. Though quite rare, silver eyes can be found most frequently in eastern Europe.  Black Eyes  Although there are some people with eyes as dark as night, this is not true black. It is actually just extremely dark brown. This happens because of a significantly higher concentration of melanin throughout the iris. Often with this eye color, it is even difficult to distinguish between the pupil and the iris.  Red or Pink Eyes  Red or pink colored eyes can be a result of albinism or blood leaking into the iris. Albino people often have extremely light blue eye from lack of pigmentation, but certain forms of albinism causes a red or pink eye color instead.  Amber Eyes  Amber colored eyes are a very rare find around the world, but they are most common in Asia and South America. This eye color can vary from a golden yellow to more of a copper color. While amber eyes are frequently confused with hazel eyes, the difference is that hazel has brown and green while amber is a single color. The high amount of lipochrome gives the appearance of glowing eyes. This eye color is found more in animals than in humans.  Violet Eyes  This is another rare eye color typically found in people with albinism. In fact, it is believed that truly violet eyes cannot exist with having albinism. Violet eyes occurs from mixing lack of pigment and red from light reflecting off of blood vessels within the eyes.  While not all of us have these eye colors, you can still make your pair look good with our glasses!

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this simple model .  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.  The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).  New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.  The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:   The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.  Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.  So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.  And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.  Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!  So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.                             Carrying a Dominant Trait               Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.  People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.  These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.  HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:    These different combinations give the following eye colors:    Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.  But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:    The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:    Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:    The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:    Here are the rest of the possibilities:    Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.  Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!  And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:    All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  (Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)  Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.                She could be carrying a brown eye gene!               Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other               Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click here to learn why no pigment gives blue.)  OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.  Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.  If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.  Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!  Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.  This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.  Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:    When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.  This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.  So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.  The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.   OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked  An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.  Imagine these parents:    If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:   The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.  Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:   Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.  Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called recombination .  That is a story for another day…     By Dr. Barry Starr, Stanford University                                                                                                               The Tech Museum of Innovation 201 South Market Street San Jose, CA 95113 +1 (408) 294-8324  The Tech Museum of Innovation 2013 © All rights reserved.

Your eye color fully matures in infancy. From this early age, you’ll have naturally brown, blue, hazel, green, or gray eyes for the rest of your life. Some people wear colored contacts to enhance the intensity or change the color of their eyes. Others go to more extreme measures.  A new controversial surgical procedure that permanently changes eye color is gaining traction. The practice, popular among celebrities, uses an artificial iris to drastically alter your eye color in a matter of minutes. Many doctors warn that this technique can lead to severe eye damage.  Temporary Temporarily changing your eye color   The easiest and most common way to change your eye color temporarily is to wear contact lenses. You can go from a deep brown to a light hazel eye in a matter of seconds (or minutes, depending how long it takes you to get the contacts in).  Colored contact lenses come in three tints:  Opaque: Opaque-tint lenses are solid and non-transparent, offering a complete color change. This type of tint works best for people with dark eyes who want to go dramatically lighter, such as going from dark brown to ice gray.  The most popular opaque colors include:  blue hazel green violet gray amethyst brown  Enhancement: Enhancement-tint contact lenses boost your natural eye color. These types of lenses are transparent and solid in color. They help define the edges of your iris and add intensity to your eye color. If, for example, you have jade-green eyes and want to alter them to emerald, enhancement lenses would work well.  Visibility: Visibility-tint contact lenses don't actually change your eye color. These lenses have faint flecks of light blue or green, which can accentuate your natural eye color.  Be aware: Decorative contact lenses  Decorative lenses, or plano contacts, are often used as fashion or costume accessories, especially during Halloween. For example, you can create cat eyes and white irises using plano contacts.  You can buy decorative lenses in stores or online, but the American Optometric Association recommends getting a prescription first. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists all contact lenses as medical devices , which means you need a valid prescription in order to purchase them.  Decorative lenses carry the same health risks as corrective lenses when used incorrectly. If you buy corrective or plano contacts without a prescription, or buy lenses that aren’t approved by the FDA, you run the chance of getting defective or unsanitary lenses.  This can increase your risk of:  blurry vision vision loss itchy, watery eyes and other allergic reactions corneal abrasion (a scratch on the outer layer of the eye) blindness  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after wearing contact lenses:  eye redness persistent eye pain discharge from your eyes slight vision loss  These may be symptoms of an eye infection. An untreated eye infection can become severe and possibly lead to blindness.  Learn more: Chronic dry eye and contact lenses »  Permanent Can you change your eye color permanently?   Iris implant surgery was first developed to treat traumatic eye injuries and medical conditions. These include aniridia, when the entire iris is missing, and coloboma, when part of the iris is missing.  During this procedure, the doctor makes a small incision in the cornea and inserts a silicone-based artificial iris, folded to fit into the slit. They then unfold the artificial iris underneath the cornea so that it covers the natural iris. Typically, they’ll use a local anesthetic.  Despite its medical purposes, the procedure has become increasingly popular for cosmetic reasons. Many people opt to undergo surgery to change their eye color, even though their natural iris functions normally.  Research shows that people who have had cosmetic iris implant surgery are more likely to experience complications.  This includes:  some vision loss or blindness glaucoma from the elevated pressure inside the eye cataracts , which occur when the clear lens of the eye becomes clouded cornea injury swelling of the cornea, known as corneal edema uveitis , a form of eye inflammation that leads to redness, pain, and blurred vision  Cosmetic iris implant surgery is a relatively new and controversial practice that has yet to be scrutinized fully by medical researchers. There is little to no evidence proving the procedure is effective and safe. The procedure hasn’t been evaluated by a regulatory agency in the United States, nor has it undergone clinical trials. Because of this, people must travel overseas to get this surgery.  Another controversial practice to permanently change your eye color from brown to blue includes the use of a low-energy laser. This laser removes pigment from the layer of interlaced tissue in the iris, known as the stroma. Gregg Homer, a scientist who founded the Stroma Medical Corporation in 2009, developed this technique. It’s not yet available to the general public. According to Stroma's website , this procedure is currently undergoing clinical trials.  Eye color over time Can eye color change over time?   The short answer: no. The pigment melanin determines your eye color. Eyes with a lot of melanin will be naturally darker. The less melanin in your eyes, the lighter they'll be.  For the most part, your eye color will stay the same from infancy. Research has found that eye color can change in rare cases due to injury or genetics.  Some people have two different colored irises from a condition called heterochromia. This condition is often caused by injury or trauma to the eye. Rarely, it may be caused by a birth defect such as Waardenburg syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, congenital Horner’s syndrome, or Parry-Romberg syndrome.  Pigmentary glaucoma may also affect your eye color. This is a type of inborn open-angle glaucoma that can develop during your 20s or 30s.  Some people have claimed that bathing your eye in a mixture of pure honey and lukewarm water will change its color over time. There's no scientific evidence supporting this. In fact, it's very unlikely because the mixture wouldn’t be able to penetrate the cornea to get to your iris. So while honey can help ease inflammation and treat dry eye , it won't change your eye color.  Takeaway The bottom line   The American Academy of Ophthalmology came out against cosmetic iris implant surgery in 2014. The organization warned that the procedure could lead to severe eye complications, including vision loss and blindness. Many ophthalmologists agree and have panned the surgery over the last few years. Although the procedure may be popular among celebrities, that doesn't mean it's actually safe in the long run.  If you want to change your eye color, opt for a non-invasive, temporary change, such as using tinted contacts. Wearing prescription or decorative contacts may come with some risks, but contacts can be far safer than going under the knife.

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

Please Share!   Human eye color charts once were used to "predict" eye colors of children.  In the most simplified versions of these charts, brown eyes are considered dominant over both blue and green eyes. And green eyes are thought to be dominant over blue eyes .  While these concepts generally are true, the genetics of how eye colors are inherited turn out to be far more complicated than once thought.  You can't simply determine the eye colors of grandparents and parents, then calculate the odds of what color a baby's eyes will be. In fact, you can belong to a family with many generations of brown-eyed individuals and still end up with green or blue eyes.    Eye Color Facts                 Contrary to popular belief, it's also possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.  Eye colors depend on the amount of pigment (melanin) found in the iris and how it is distributed. Light gray-blue eyes contain much less pigment than extremely dark brown eyes. And there are many shades of eye color in between.  SEE ALSO:  What Determines Hazel Eye Color >  Some people are even born with eyes of two different colors, a condition known as heterochromia .

Obviously, the percentage of dark brown eyes found in Asian and African populations will be much higher than in European populations.  And some day, blue may be a rare eye color. This is because more people now select mates outside usual cultural and ethic groups. So when a brown-eyed person marries someone with blue eyes, offspring are more likely to inherit the more dominant brown eyes.

How it works           The determination of the eye color of an individual is a complex and fascinating phenomenon, especially when the birth of a new child approaches.  What color would my child's eyes be?  What are his chances of having brown, blue or green eyes?  The following answers are simplified explanations, the determination of the eye color of an individual depends on much more parameters than those cited below.  This method of calculation takes into account only three theoretical eye colors: brown, green and blue.
					
					The results given by this calculator are an estimate of the chance of having a child with the eyes of one of these three colors.  Two principal genes are detected as determinants for eye color: EYCL3 (localized on chromosome 15) and EYCL1 (localized on chromosome 19).
					
					The EYCL3 gene determines the amount of melanin present in our eye color, light eyes or dark eyes. Its value can be: B (Brown) or b (blue).					
					The EYCL1 gene determines the blue color or green color of our eyes.
					Its value may be: G (Green) or b (blue).  On each chromosome, we have two different alleles that come from our mother AND our father.  These genes have a dominance / recessivity ratio between them, that is, some genes will override others. The B gene is dominant on the b gene, and the G gene is dominant on the b gene. The b gene is always recessive.  For example, an individual with brown eyes may have the combination:  Chromosome 15 (EYCL3 gene): Allele 1 => B, allele 2 => b, dominant gene => B Chromosome 19 (EYCL1 gene): Allele 1 => b, allele 2 => b, dominant gene => b The color determined by the EYCL1 gene is blue, but that determined by the EYCL3 gene is brown.
					
					Finally, this individual would have brown eyes because the gene EYCL3 (having value B) will be dominant on the EYCL1 gene (having value b).  The notion of "undefined" color corresponds to an individual whose eye color is unknown. This means that he can possess one of the sixteen possible combinations that can determine the color of his eyes.  Of the sixteen possible combinations: twelve correspond to the brown color, three to the green color, and one to the blue color.  Here are the sixteen possible combinations:  BB GG => BROWN BB Gb => BROWN BB bG => BROWN BB bb => BROWN Bb GG => BROWN Bb Gb => BROWN Bb bG => BROWN Bb bb => BROWN BB GG => BROWN BB Gb => BROWN BB bG => BROWN BB bb => BROWN Bb GG => GREEN Bb Gb => GREEN Bb bG => GREEN Bb bb => BLUE   When we know the color of an individual's eyes, we can determine the possible combinations corresponding to him.
The chromosomes of baby will be made up of one or the other of the alleles of each of the parents.  We can therefore calculate all the possible combinations determined by the eye color of each parent.  For example:  - For two parents with brown eyes, the number of possible combinations is 331776 !!! - For two parents with blue eyes, the number of possible combinations is now only 16 (but all equal to "bb bb").  Using this method of calculation, we find that two parents with blue eyes and / or green eyes can not have a child with brown eyes. Whereas in reality this could happen! Even if the possibilities are minimal, they prove the limits of this method of calculation.  It is for this reason that the calculator is "rigged" when the final result is displayed, in the event that both parents have green and or blue eyes, to indicate a minimum percentage of chance that the child could have brown eyes.           Frequently asked questions             What are the different elements that make up the eye?   The eye is an organ that detects light and is the basis of the sense of sight. Its function is to convert light energy into electrical signals that are sent to the brain through the optic nerve. The human eye works in a very similar manner to that of most vertebrates and some molluscs.  It is made up of :    Of a lens, which is adjustable according to the distance;  Of a "diaphragm", called pupil, whose diameter is regulated by the iris;  And a light-sensitive tissue, which is the retina..    The light penetrates through the pupil, passes through the lens and is projected on the retina, where it is transformed, thanks to cells called photoreceptors, into nerve impulses that will be transported via the optic nerve to reach the brain.     Does the color of the eyes change with age?   The color or tint of the eyes of a human being changes very little during our existence, except during the first days of our lives when the color of our baby's eyes is not yet completely determined.  But some diseases, or serious accidents can slightly transform the color of our eyes.  Another cause of an individual's eye color change is the fact that some have an iris or melanin is not uniformly distributed, resulting in an iris of many colors. According to various external changes (such as sunlight), or physiological (blood pressure), the color perceived by people watching you may differ.     Can we change the color of his eyes?   The color of the eyes depends on the type and amount of pigment the iris has. This pigment, called melanin, is a natural eye protection against ultraviolet rays.  During the evolution of the human species, over the centuries, a greater amount of melanin has developed in the sunnier areas (brown eyes, black eyes, brown eyes) and less melanin (gray eyes, blue eyes, green eyes) in the less luminous areas.  Many people, for aesthetic reasons, want to change the color of their eyes and the only way is the use of cosmetic contact lenses which, if they are well adapted, is a safe method.     What is the percentage of people with brown, green or blue eyes?   The distribution of the color of the eyes of human beings on our planet is far from homogeneous. This distribution varies enormously according to the geographical areas and ethnic groups represented.  The eye colors vary from blue, green brown, amber, brown, almost black, gray or even multicolored! But we can classify them into three main categories: blue, green and brown.  The most represented color in the world is the brown color, with about 75% of the world's population, then comes the color of blue eyes with about 23% and finally the color green with less than 2%.     What are the laws of Mendelian genetics?   Mendel's laws were developed by a genetic researcher, considered the father of genetics: Gregor Mendel. This scientist has conducted experiments that have elucidated the fundamental elements of heredity, an example of Mendel's law is the prediction of the traits of descendants by the characteristics of the parents of an animal or plant species.  This scientist has been inventing some of the most well known terms of genetics, such as the terms "dominant" and "recessive", which are hereditary factors present in the characteristics and hereditary traits of organisms across the three laws from Mendel. Which are: "Law of uniformity of the first generation hybrids", "Law of disjunction of the alleles" and "Law of independent segregation of the multiple hereditary characters".     Where does the color of green eyes come from?   Green eyes are the product of moderate amounts of melanin. Green is an intermediate color between brown tones and blue or gray tones.  The genes involved are EYCL1 and EYCL3. Thus, the dominant allele for EYCL1, conjugated to any allele for EYCL3, with the exception of the dominant allele of the latter, leads to the green color of the eyes. It is native to Europe and only 2% of the world's population has this eye color.     What is the origin of the color of blue eyes?   Soon after birth, many babies have blue eyes, even if their parents have brown eyes, because the melanin proteins responsible for the pigmentation of the iris have not all been released yet.  It is the variation of the levels of this pigment, associated with the effect of light interference, which gives birth to all the colors of the eyes that we know. Depending on the amount of melanin present, the eye may appear dark brown, light, nutty, green, gray or blue.  In 2008, a team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen discovered a particular genetic mutation regulating a protein needed for melanin production.  According to Hans Eiberg, who led the research, this genetic discovery suggests that all the blue-eyed people around us today are the descendants of a single human being, who would probably have lived between the ages of 6,000 and 10,000.  Eidberg argues that all people had brown eyes until this genetic mutation in the OCA2 gene triggers a process that literally "extinguishes" the ability to produce the brown color in the iris.  However, before this gene was discovered, Francis Galton was already curious about the origin of blue eye color, as Hugh Aldersey-Williams explains in his book Anatomies:  « A briefcase with sixteen numbered glass eyes of different colors was constructed. The eyes have been arranged in a sheet of molded metal so as to provide each eye with eyelids and an eyebrow, a surreal dread occurs when the briefcase is opened for the first time. Galton had to make sure that the color labels he had chosen from the "wide variety of terms" used by compilers of family registers were the most important in nature. He did not choose brown or blue, as we usually do, but categories of light and dark, dividing those with "hazel" eyes into both fields. Then he compared the children with their parents and grandparents, using abundantly their usual statistical storm, but found nothing more remarkable to say at the end of his observation is that the blue and brown eyes persist for generations. »  It seems that people with blue or green eyes are more likely to suffer from skin cancer, especially melanoma. In reality, being a person with white skin and blue eyes is an anomaly that has been produced by very specific conditions.  About 20% of the population has blue eyes. They are relatively common in Europe, with more marked areas in the Nordic and Eastern countries where the majority of the population has blue eyes.     Can we have one eye of one color and the other of another?   Yes, but it's pretty rare. Studies show that fewer than 11 out of a thousand people have different colored eyes.  This strange feature is due to several factors, and can change over time. The color of the iris develops during the first months after birth, melanin levels in the iris determine the color of the eyes. But sometimes the concentration and distribution of melanin are not uniform in both eyes, leading to a known phenomenon called heterochromia.  This anomaly can occur in different ways:   Complete heterochromia, when each eye is of a clearly different color, for example, a blue and other brown eye.  Central heterochromia, when the eyes have many colors, like a blue iris with a yellow-brown ring around the pupil.  And sectoral heterochromia, when the iris has a touch of color different from its general tone.  Alterations in eye pigmentation are not necessarily indicative of an underlying medical problem, but are the common features of many hereditary genetic disorders. But sometimes the formation of tumors inside the eye can cause heterochromia.     Why do babies have blue eyes at birth?   The color of the eye is due to the amount of melanin that the iris contains. It is a protein secreted by melanocytes that stain the iris, hair and skin.  In the newborn, the melanin-producing cells, the melanocytes, are still immature and produce melanin in small amounts. Over the months, this melanin production increases and darkens the skin, hair and eyes. There is a popular belief, which links the light color of the baby's eyes to the duration of breastfeeding. In other words, some people think that the light color of the baby's eyes is caused by breastfeeding. In fact, there is no scientific basis for this belief. The average duration of breastfeeding being 6 to 9 months, this could coincide with the darkening of the eyes of a baby depending on the maturation of melanocytes. But there appears to be a relationship between sun exposure and activation of melanin production by melanocytes. In some adults, the color of their eyes has changed as a function of their exposure to the sun. But the final color of a baby's eyes is defined genetically even though some external factors such as light are likely to influence it. After birth, if the melanocytes secrete a small amount of melanin, the baby will have blue eyes. If this amount is a bit higher, the baby's eyes will be green, honey or hazel. And if the secretion of melanin is greater, the baby's eyes will be brown, dark brown or black.     Can a blue-eyed mother and father have a brown-eyed baby?      Can two parents with brown eyes have a baby with blue eyes?      What are all the colors of the existing eyes?      What is the rarest eye color?

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this simple model .  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.  The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).  New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.  The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:   The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.  Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.  So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.  And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.  Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!  So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.                             Carrying a Dominant Trait               Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.  People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.  These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.  HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:    These different combinations give the following eye colors:    Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.  But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:    The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:    Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:    The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:    Here are the rest of the possibilities:    Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.  Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!  And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:    All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  (Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)  Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.                She could be carrying a brown eye gene!               Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other               Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click here to learn why no pigment gives blue.)  OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.  Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.  If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.  Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!  Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.  This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.  Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:    When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.  This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.  So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.  The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.   OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked  An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.  Imagine these parents:    If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:   The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.  Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:   Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.  Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called recombination .  That is a story for another day…     By Dr. Barry Starr, Stanford University                                                                                                               The Tech Museum of Innovation 201 South Market Street San Jose, CA 95113 +1 (408) 294-8324  The Tech Museum of Innovation 2013 © All rights reserved.

Dominant vs. Recessive          Back to Dominant vs. Recessive           English   Español       Which parent gives you the most dominant genes?        -An undergraduate from Indiana   October 12, 2011  Except for a few special cases (see below), it doesn't really matter which parent gave you which gene. If a gene version is dominant, it will dominate whether it came from mom or dad.  So your chances of getting a dominant trait don't depend on which parent it came from. If mom gives you the dominant brown eye version of an eye color gene, odds are you'll end up with brown eyes. Same thing if dad passes the same gene. In neither case would you have higher odds for getting brown eyes.  Now that isn't to say that if mom has brown eyes then all her kids will too. They could end up with the other parent's recessive blue or green eyes. Or an eye color that neither parent has!  This is how brown-eyed parents end up with a blue-eyed child. Or how two parents who don't have red hair have a redheaded baby.  As you can see, genetics is a complicated business. But one thing we do know...no one is more likely to favor one parent over the other. Which traits you get depend on the combination of genes you get from both parents.  What I'll do for the rest of the answer is explain a bit about how genes work. Then I'll focus on some situations where the parents do matter. As you'll see, this is usually when a trait is on the X chromosome.   Dominant and Recessive  Let's say that a child has a mom with brown eyes and dad with blue eyes. Since brown eyes are dominant, the mom can have either one brown (B) and one blue (b) version of an eye color gene or she can have two browns. As geneticists like to say, she can be either Bb or BB.  To make things easier, we will say that she is BB (both genes are the brown version). Since the dad has blue eyes, he has two copies of the recessive blue version. He is bb.  Each parent will pass one copy of their eye color gene to their child. In this case, the mom will always pass B and the dad will always pass b. This means all of their kids will be Bb and have brown eyes. Each child will show the mom's dominant trait.  Now if we flip things around where the father has two brown versions (BB) and the mom has two blue ones (bb), the child will still end up Bb and having brown eyes. It doesn't matter if B came from mom or dad. It only mattered that the child got a B.  I don't want you to think that if one parent shows the dominant trait, all their children will too. They may not. Let me give another eye color example to show you what I mean.  Imagine a mom with one version of the brown and one version of the blue eye color gene. She is Bb and has brown eyes. Dad is bb and has blue eyes.  These are the same eye colors that the parents had in the first example. But the result could turn out very differently.  The kids each have a 50% chance of having mom's brown eyes and a 50% chance of having dad's blue eyes. (This is because mom has a 50% chance of passing her B and a 50% chance of passing her b.) So in this case, the kids can end up with mom's dominant trait or dad's recessive one. Which one is a simple matter of chance.*  And if we take a Bb dad (brown eyes) and a bb mother (blue eyes), there is still a 50% chance for the child to have blue eyes. Again it didn't matter which parent gave which gene version. What was important is that these two gene versions were involved.  This is true for many, many traits besides eye color. But not all of them. Sometimes it matters whether your mom or dad has a dominant trait.   Blame (or Thank) Mom Through our discussion so far, you may have picked up on the fact that we have two copies of our genes - one from mom and one from dad. But this isn't true for every gene.   Red-green colorblindness (II) is one of the few traits where it matters which parent the gene came from.  Whether you are a boy or a girl mostly depends on whether you have an X and a Y chromosome or two X's. If you have an X and a Y, then you are a boy. If you have two X's, then you are a girl.  This matters for our discussion because it means that girls (and so moms) have two copies of all the genes on the X chromosome while boys (and dads) have just one. The genes on mom's X chromosome will dominate for her sons whether they are dominant or recessive. Let's look at color blindness as an example to figure out why.  Imagine that mom is colorblind. Since being colorblind is recessive, she has two copies of the color blind version of the gene (c). Geneticists say she is Xc Xc because the recessive version is on the X chromosome.  In our case, dad isn't color blind. Since he has just one X chromosome, he has a single copy of the version of the gene that lets him tell red from green. He is XC Y. (The XC means he has the dominant version of the color vision gene on his X. The Y has no color vision gene on it and so is here as a marker.)  OK, now what happens when these two parents have sons? They are all colorblind like their mother. Her recessive trait dominates!  Let me take you through how this happened. Since the child is a boy, we know dad passed his Y (otherwise the child would be a girl). This doesn't contribute any color vision genes.  Mom will pass one of her Xc's to her son. The son now has an Xc and a Y. He has no dominant color vision gene version to overcome his color blind version and so is color blind like his mother. Every son will have that trait.  Colorblindness is one of a few special traits where it matters which parent a gene copy came from. For most traits it doesn't matter. What matters is the combination of genes you get no matter the source.  * As we talk about here , it is also possible for the child to have green, hazel or any other eye color.

A Genetic Explanation    What Color Will My Baby's Eyes Be? A Genetic Explanation      by:  Rebecca Desfosse   Blue, brown or somewhere in between? Check out some of the genetics that determine your little one's eye color.                     Are you crossing your fingers hoping for a brown-eyed baby? Or, are you wondering how on earth you ended up with blue-eyes with two parents with brown eyes? Don't worry, you weren't switched at birth and your little one could have brown eyes no matter what color her parents' eyes are. The genetics behind eye color is an extremely complex and intricate game of chance. When it comes to the question, "What color will my baby's eyes be?" the truth is that it's impossible to tell, but it's really fun to guess.  Eye Color and Melanin   Eye colors are completely fascinating. In any given group of people, you can find dozens of different shades of gray, green, hazel, blue and brown. What we call eye color is actually the color of the iris. The amount of a pigment called melanin found in your iris produces your eye color, with blue eyes being produced by the least amount of melanin and brown being produced by the most. The resulting eye color can be any and every shade in between -- all determined by a complex process of genetics.  Here's the quick lowdown: Typically, two blue-eyed parents end up with a blue-eyed child, but not always. Likewise, two brown-eyed parents are likely (but not guaranteed) to have a child with brown eyes. If one parent has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes, their child has about a 50/50 chance of either ending up with brown or blue eyes.  The Theory of Mendelian Genetics  It was originally thought that eye color was determined by a simplistic model of Mendelian genetics, meaning it was determined by a single gene, with brown eyes considered dominant and blue recessive. It has now been determined that eye color is a polygenic trait, meaning it is determined by multiple genes. According to Dr. Jennifer Stagg , a biochemist turned naturopathic physician and author of Unzip Your Genes: 5 Choices To Reveal A Radically Radiant You , "There are a number of genes that are responsible for eye color, but the two primary genes, OCA2 and HERC2 are on chromosome 15." The OCA2 gene produces a transporter of tyrosine, which produces melanin, while HERC2 regulates the OCA2 genes' expression.  Using a Punnett Square  Punnet squares aren't completely useless even with this new information. According to Dr. Stagg, "Old Mendelian Punnett squares are a fun tool to predict eye color, but we now know that charts are too simplified an approach when it comes to genetics." For example, using the Mendelian model, two parents with blue eyes wouldn't be able to have a baby with blue eyes, but we know that it is not impossible. That being said, the Punnett square does accurately predict that it is possible for two parents with brown eyes to have a blue-eyed baby. "Even with the outdated Mendelian model, if both parents each have a dominant and recessive gene for eye color, they could end up having a blue-eyed baby only if both parents pass on a recessive gene," says Dr. Stagg.  Let's explore this example further with a Punnnet square:  To make a Punnett square, you first need to create a table. Put your two possible gene versions on the top using a large B or brown, the dominant trait, and a small b for blue, the recessive trait. Add your partner's gene versions on the side of the table:    B  b  B      b      Next, fill in each square with the letters from the top and side to figure out all possible variations:    B  b  B  BB  Bb  b  Bb  Bb  As you can see, there is a one out of four chance that a child of two parents with brown eyes will have a blue-eyed baby if their parents carry the recessive gene for blue eyes. Fun right?  Eye Color at Birth  As if predicting eye color weren't confusing enough, the color eyes your baby has at birth might not stick around. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics , it takes up to one year for the melanocytes to build up to the right amount of melanin in the eyes. Most babies are born with blue eyes (remember, it's the eye color produced by the least amount of melanin), but that can quickly change to green, hazel or even brown.  If you're a pregnant mama wondering, "What color will my baby's eyes be?" try playing around with Punnett squares for fun, but remember that it's all up to chance -- and the complex mystery that is genetics.

Animated video shows the likelihood of a child's eye colour based on what their parents have  A video shows likelihood of child's eye colour based on parents Parents with green and brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes Dominant gene from parents is the determining factor of a baby's eyes By Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia   Published: 22:59 EDT, 12 May 2016 |  Updated: 23:37 EDT, 12 May 2016              e-mail          145  shares     131  View comments     Did you know if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your baby could have blue eyes? A video shared on My Child Magazine Australia 's Facebook page has crunched the numbers and shows the likelihood of  a baby having a certain eye colour based on what their parents have. For example, if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your child is 50 per cent more likely to have brown eyes, but also has a 38 per cent chance of having green eyes and a 12 per cent chance of having blue eyes. Scroll down for video          Brown eyed boy: Video shows what your baby's eye colour could be based on you and your partners eyes                      It's all in the genes: If you and your partner have green eyes, you baby is likely to have green eyes too If you have blue eyes and your partner has brown, there's a 50-50 chance your baby will have either of those colours, according to the video. While if both parents have green eyes, their baby has a 75 per cent chance of having the same colour, a 24 per cent chance of having blue eyes and a one per cent chance of having brown eyes. Eye colour is a hereditary trait from parents and determines a baby's eye colour. One eye colour can be more expressive, or dominant, than another, and can therefore dictate what a baby's eye colour will be. Brown eyes are dominant over green or blue, while green is always dominant over the recessive blue eyes gene, according to Huggies.com.au .
