If you flip a coin, the odds are 50-50 you'll get heads.   When we talk about odds, we're talking about probabilities, specifically, how likely it is that something will happen. Is there a 5% chance? Is there a 95% chance? If there's a 95% chance, then the odds are great. We can talk about the odds of anything happening, as long as it hasn't happened yet. Anyone predicting the weather is telling the odds of rain or snow â€” they don't know for sure.

For the concept of odd and even in mathematics, see Parity (mathematics) .  For the 1978 film, see Odds and Evens (film) .     Three rounds of the game, showing two, three and four fingers.    Odds and evens , also known as swords , choosies , pick , odds-on poke , or bucking up , is a hand game played between two people, [1] used to decide an issue. This zero-sum game , a variation of the ancient Morra and par-impar , [2] is played internationally, especially among children.  The individuals prepare by deciding who will be assigned odds and who will be evens. Then, one or both people say "One, two, three, shoot!!" or "one, strikes, three, shoot!" [3] As the word "shoot" is said, the two people quickly and simultaneously thrust a fist into the center, extending either an index finger, or both the middle and index finger, indicating one or two . The sum total of fingers displayed is either odd or even. If the result is odd, then the person who called odds is the victor, and can decide the issue as he or she sees fit. [4] [5] [6] Often, the participants continue to shoot for a best two out of three . [7]  From a game-theoretic perspective, the game is equivalent to Matching pennies . See that article for analysis of the strategies and chances of winning.  See also [ edit ]   Chetno i likho – a game of chance where the players have to guess if the hidden objects are even or odd.  Coin flipping – a method of making a yes-or-no decision at random.  Drawing straws – a method of making a group decision - choosing one member of the group.  Matching pennies – a game of chance with a similar strategic structure, using coins instead of fingers.  Parity game – an unrelated (and much more complicated) two-player logic game, played on a colored graph.  Rock-paper-scissors – a game where each player has three alternatives instead of two.

Ask New Question   Aseem Luthra , Technical Consultant  at KPMG Global Services Answered Oct 8, 2017 The term “What are the odds” is used to indicate chances of a particular event happening. Take this for example. There are two friends Mr X and Mr Y. Both of them go to a pub and Mr X gives Mr Y a dare, saying “You will have to click a selfie with 10 unknown strangers tonight”. Assuming that Mr Y takes on this dare, in this case odds is nothing but the probability of Mr Y successfully doing this dare. So if we say 1 in 10, it means that there is a chance that he will be able to get clicked once every 10 attempts. If it is 1 in 100, it means that he has a probability of getting clicked once in 100 chances. Important thing to note is that the probability will be described in terms of odd numbers, like 3 in 12, 7 in 30, 11 in 50. 4.1k Views promoted  by Grammarly Write with confidence.

Anyways, relative to time and your current existence , I would say there is a 100% inevitability that you will die Today! Yes, you read it right! Technically, when you will die, it will be TODAY to you. Moreover, maybe Today is Everyday until you reach your LAST TODAY, at which point you cease to exist on that day, which will be TODAY !

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Probability and Gambling  Sports Betting  Betting  Gambling Betting: If someone says they'll give me 3:1 odds on the occurrence of an event, what does it mean? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 15 Answers   Simon Brown , former Seo Answered Apr 13, 2017 Odds are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics. In statistics, the odds for or odds of some event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while odds against reflect the likelihood that it will not. In gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event. Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event. In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. In statistics, the odds for an event E are defined as a simple function of the probability of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the uncertainty of this possible event as odds for is that to regain the probability requires a calculation. The natural way to interpret odds for (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) odds for rolling six with a fair die (one of a pair of dice) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 six event for every 5 times the die does not show six. For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 sixes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) odds against, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the odds against rolling a six with a fair die are 5 to 1. The probability of rolling a six with a fair die is the single number 1/6, roughly 0.17. The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a six will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a six and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a six, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a six and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no disadvantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. Casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the United States. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.

If a team has X:1 odds of covering the spread, what does that mean? Ask New Question   Peter Hand Answered Jan 14, 2016 · Author has 6.2k answers and 11.4m answer views " Odds on " means the event is more likely to happen than not, so for every $3 you bet, you win only $1 . If you were offered "odds against", then for every $1 you bet you would win $3. With odds on, it's as if the bookie is making the bet and you're paying him off, although you pay him off first and if he loses he gives you his stake. People are pretty casual with words these days so if someone says they'll give you 3:1 odds on something they probably mean odds against. But words do have a meaning, and that meaning can cost you money. So if it's a horse you're betting on or a professional gambler you're talking to, you should make sure you understand exactly what you're doing first. 38.4k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?   Andrew Brocker , Sports betting analyst, trader, writer Answered Jan 28, 2015 Betting odds can be presented in a number of different formats.  In this case, they are using what are known as Fractional Odds. So 3:1 means that if your bet wins, they will give you 3 for every 1 that you bet. So let's say you want to be $10, it means you will win 3 times this if your bet wins. In this case $30. In terms of analysis, the first thing you need to do is determine if the chances of the outcome occurring is greater than the probability represented in those odds. So what is the probability of the odds 3:1? We calculate this in the following way: We divide the denominator (in this case, 1) by the numerator + denominator (in this case 3+1), which gives us a probability of 25%. If you think the occurrence of the event is greater than 25%, then you should make the bet. If not, then no.

David Ramsey , Former pro poker player Answered Oct 19, 2017 · Author has 1.1k answers and 412.8k answer views A2A “Betting: If someone says they’ll give me 3:1 odds on the occurrence of an event, what does it mean? Also, what approach should we use on our analysis on whether to take the bet or not?” Let’s say the amount you bet is $100. If someone gives you 3:1 odds on that bet, that means that if you win, you’ll receive $300. In terms of how to know whether or not to take the bet, the implication of a bet where 3:1 odds are given is that the event has a 75% chance to go the odds-givers way, and a 25% chance to go your way. If you believe that this event will go your way more than 25% of the time, you should take the bet. If you believe that this event will go your way less than 25% of the time, you should not take it. 832 Views · Answer requested by  Bryan Frizzelle   Anup U Jamsandekar , good at finding possibilities Answered Jul 5, 2016 · Author has 136 answers and 100.5k answer views The traditional way of representing fixed odds are fractions. If some says you get 3:1 odds that means you if you bet 1$ with him he will give you 3$ in return plus your original 1$. So you secure initial bet money that is 1$ and you earn 3$ as a profit. You can also have odds in decimal format. Decimal format is pretty simple way in which you can calculate your profit and investment. Simple Maths! For Example: click here and you will see the market for US Presidential Election 2016 Winner. here the for Hillary Clinton to become next president is 1.25 (this is decimal odd), so if you bet 1$ you get back 1.25$ That’s all how odds work. 4.8k Views · View Upvoters   Craig Hubley , policy analyst, risk assessor, systems integrator Answered Jul 2, 2015 · Author has 456 answers and 252.1k answer views "3:1" or "3 to 1" means that the payoff is 3/1 (or "three times") the original bet, if it succeeds.  Such a payoff reflects the bookmaker's (or counterparty's) belief that the odds of success are less than 1 in 4 (4=1+3) or less than 25%. So, if the bookmaker believes an event is 22% likely, and offers 3 to 1 odds "against it", they expect to pay out 22% of bets but collect 25% of the total of all bets, for a 3% of all bets profit.  If the number of betters is indeed 3 to 1. If the amount gambled by betters begins to get much higher than say 27% or 30% of the total betters, then the bookmaker will very likely revisit the odds, assuming (usually correctly) that the "wisdom of the crowd" is more accurate than their own assumptions, and adjust the odds.  Perhaps to 2 to 1 (a 33% chance of success in the bookmaker's opinion). Depending on the type of gambling, all bets may be adjusted to the new odds, or the earlier bets may stand with the payoff when they were made. 7.6k Views · View Upvoters   Craig Berger , Screenwriter Answered May 15, 2016 · Author has 461 answers and 417.1k answer views If you’re getting 3:1, or 3 to 1, it means for every dollar you wager, you can win 3. So if you bet $10 and lose, you lose $10, but if you win, you win $30. As someone else has explained, this is an expression of someone’s impression of the probability of an event. If someone is offering you 3 to 1, it means they believe that the even you’re betting on will occur less than one time out of every four (or one time for every three that the event doesn’t occur). If you believe the event will occur more than 1 time for every 3 times it doesn’t, you should take the bet. Be sure you know the difference between 3 to 1 and 3 FOR 1. If you’re getting 3 FOR 1 you lose your bet no matter what, so if you bet $10 and win, you still win $30, but that includes the money you have already bet, so you’re really only winning$20. So 3 FOR 1 is actually 2 TO 1. 6.7k Views · View Upvoters   Jerry Katz , studied at B.S. Ch.e MBA Marketing Answered Apr 27, 2016 · Author has 64 answers and 18.9k answer views It means that you bet 1 to obtain 3.  But, if it is a private individual, ask the person how much you would win if you bet 1 unit. That would clarify it. 3:1 can be a good bet or a bad bet. For example, if a person says they will give you 3:1 that the world will not end today; that would be a bad bet. If a person would give you 3:1 odds that you can't guess whether a coin will come up heads or tails when flipped and lands on the ground' that would be a good bet for you, as long as you use your own coin. As always, though, thoroughly investigate and beware if a bet seems too good to be true. 5k Views · View Upvoters   Seth Miller , works at Freecie.com Answered Mar 12, 2014 It means that if you win, you'll win 3 times the amount of your original bet. In this particular case the odds of the event are useless to decide whether you should take the bet or not (all they determine is your greed); you should find and structure data that can help you determine the probability of winning the bet (there are different variables depending on the event). For example, if it was a football match you would take into account individual player stats, previous matches performance, any changes in the team, morale (if possible, although usually it's nearly impossible to determine this factor), weather, field, etc... If you gave more information I'd give you a more specific answer as to which variables to take into account when making the analysis, but as of now, that's the most complete answer I can give you. 9k Views · View Upvoters   Deepak Kumar , 10 Year Experience in Gambling and Sports Betting Answered Jun 6, 2016 · Author has 202 answers and 117.1k answer views That Was Very simple to predict the Odds of the Betting site Like if they offered you 3:1 Odds on the Occurrence of the Event that means if you should Place a Bet on Odds of 3,000 and if you won they will Return 4,000.

Then if it does rain today, you will win $400 (your original $100 + $300). If it does not rain, you will lose your $100 stake. Decimal odds are usually more straightforward, but some countries are more familiar with fractional odds. The simple rule of converting fractional odds to decimal odds is to simply divide the odds and add 1 to the answer. E.g. if Fractional odds is 3/1, to convert it to decimal odds: 3 divided by 1 plus 1.

If I'm not much mistaken, there are around 5,000 gods being worshipped today, which would put the existence of the Abrahamic deity at 5,000 to one against. But then, as we know, gods are prone to testing their subjects, so it could be that there's one true god, who resembles not of the currently worshipped gods, arms crossed, scowling, tapping its celestial toe, just waiting for us to come back to it, in which case, it could be any god from history, which pushes the odds way above ten thousand to one, not including all the spirits and deities lost to the mists of time.  And the end of the day, if you can't be sure of any gods existence, the idea in settling on one and hoping you got it right first time, seems a little short sighted. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters   Mar Moo Answered Feb 9, 2018 · Author has 631 answers and 52.7k answer views Q: What are the odds of God's existence?

If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas they stand to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in Hell). https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/... 135 Views · View Upvoters   Matthew L Reigada , Common sense Answered Feb 9, 2018 · Author has 1.4k answers and 512.1k answer views Either 0 or 1. The die has already been cast, God either exist or doesn’t. The question is not probability but is instead likelihood (there is a formal difference). We cannot repeat trials of universes to see if there is a God or not to formally estimate likelihood in our specific universe, so any method towards generating a number here will be purely speculative. 39 Views · View Upvoters   Jerome Gagnon-Boivin , Master in philosophy, former Christian. Answered Sep 23, 2015 To calculate the odd of God existence we need: 1) A working definition of God. 2) A way to test the probability of the existence of God as defined in 1). (Logic or empirical experimentations can work here.) The problem is that a non-existant being doesn't leave proof of it's non-existence. We have no empirical way to prove that the tooth-fairy, Big-foot or leprechaun doesn't exist. But we don't have any sufficent reason to believe they do exist neither. So the best way to calculate the odd, is by an analysis of the given definition and the confrontation of that definition to the known world. By exemple: E picurus' argument from evil tends to demonstrated that a God defined as omnipotant and omnibenevolent is incompatible with a world where evil does exist. So if we can demonstrate that evil exist (war, famine, child abuse, etc.) then we can conclude that such a definition of God is incompatible with our world and has 0% chance of existing in it. Some other definitions of God, like a «natural» or «pantheist» interpretation are coherant and so vague that we absolutly can't disprove them. Nor can we calculate the odd. So, the answer will be either: 0% or impossible to calculate depending of the given definition. All we need is a working definition, one that we can test empirically or logically, and compare it to the facts. 173 Views · View Upvoters   Draco Valdez , Guitarist, Composer at Monado Answered Jan 24, 2018 Originally Answered: What are the chances of the existence of God? Well…it's not good at this juncture. I will say that on the surface, the possibility for the exsistence of God is the same as the possibility that it doesnt. The reason I think we can say with some confidence that the chances of no God is greater is that things we used to attribute to God's intervention (like say…the seasons) we have now shown and proven there to be rational explanations and mechanics behind them, and a God is not required to make them tick. We can say the examples we have of God in religion have been shown to be illogical, prone to emotional compromise, violent, and have questionable moral systems. These characteristics are not befitting of the arbiter of the cosmos but seem to be a reflection of the mental fragmentation of human authors. Now this does not mean the magic wizard in the sky does not exsist, because it is within possibility, but it is highly unlikely. I do not see any reason to give credence to the plausibility of the schizophrenic Sky Wizard. As far as there being something metaphysical and abstract that is a force that pervades the universe, which we can call God, that's a different story entirley and in my opinion completely valid as a concept. 45 Views   Or Shefer , Always on to something new Answered Jan 25, 2018 · Author has 286 answers and 24.3k answer views Originally Answered: What are the chances of the existence of God? What are the chances of the existence of God? There’s no evidence. There are no valid arguments in favor. Each religion has contradictory books, cultures, and ideologies within itself. Three religions each with one infinite god, with one relying on Judaism’s teachings and one relying also on Christianity’s messiah, yet they claim each god is different. And everyone else is wrong, of course. Add that with the fact there is always another explanation, eg with personalexperiences. That amounts to 0%. Release the infinity, omnipotence, omnipresence, flawlessness, etc., i.e. fallible believable deity like Odin and you get a chance that’s about one in the distance of 14 billion light years in centimeters.

Unless, of course, you are comparing it with examples of incidences in which no god is apparent, which would be, literally, every other example . In that case, the comparative odds become relatively infinite in the direction against the existence of a god- or, simply, reducing the odds of a god existing to near statistical zero. It should be noted that I am not, by ay means, a mathemetitian, nor a statistician. I am approaching this with only a very limited understanding of how to measure such things, and may be entirely wrong in my approach. If anyone who is qualified in this area disagrees, then they would probably know better than I would.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Shot  Guns and Firearms in the United States of America  Probability (statistics)  Guns and Firearms  The United States of America What are the odds of being shot and killed in the US? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 16 Answers   Sam Hoober , Gun Writer, Concealed Carry Advocate, Outdoorsman and Other Answered Jul 28, 2016 · Author has 207 answers and 124.3k answer views This isn’t going to be a wildly accurate answer, but here goes…the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 11,208 homicides by firearm (out of 16,121 homicides total; roughly 70 percent of all homicides), 505 unintentional (keyword there) deaths to firearms and 281 deaths due to discharge of firearm due to completely unknown causes. It’s true that overall deaths by firearms is more than 30,000; most (more than 20,000 of them) are suicides, so those should be set aside. Overall, near as makes no difference (for these purposes) 2.597 million people died in that year. (2013) Of those, 11,994 people were killed by guns in a manner that was not suicide or 0.46 percent (less than half of one percent) of all deaths. Therefore, you could say - in a grossly inaccurate, roundabout way - that the overall odds are 0.46 percent. However, let’s drill that down a little more. What circumstances do you mean? Do you mean purposefully murdered or accidentally shot? Homicide by firearm - 11,208 in 2013 - would account for roughly 0.432 percent of all deaths. Accidental shootings (whether a person accidentally shoots themselves or is accidentally shot by someone else) would account for 0.03 percent of all deaths. I am not a statistician and this is entirely using back-of-the-envelope (so to speak) math. Also, there are other factors that go into the overall risk. Some areas (such as Chicago’s South Side) put a person at a much higher risk than others. Additionally, the CDC doesn’t mention how many of those homicides were gang-related; ostensibly it would be well more than 50 percent, but I couldn’t find any reliable data or even conjectures on that. (I’ve tried.) So, to sum up - the overall chances are less than half a percent, so long as you stay away from known bad neighborhoods and don’t join a criminal gang. Then your chances increase. 20.7k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Michael Losey Related Questions More Answers Below What are odds of getting shot by mass killer compared to other means of death?

Updated Apr 7, 2018 · Author has 291 answers and 292.7k answer views Assault by firearm is the 10th most likely cause of death in the USA, with the odds at 1 in 300. Not particularly helpful by itself, without some context. The kinds of things that are more likely to kill you include heart disease, #1 at 1 in 6, cancer #2 and 1 in 7, stroke, #3 at 1 in 28, and suicide, #5 at 1 in 115. All of these you can do something about, especially if you're in a high risk category. Accidental poisoning (#6 at 1 in 139) and accidental falls (#7 at 1 in 184) are remarkably more likely than most people think, given how little thought we given them. Your risk of dying from a car accident is just a little greater than getting killed by firearm, at #8, 1 in 272. This is obviously also one where you can move yourself into a low risk category (wear a seat belt, and the four don'ts: speed, dui, drive while tired, or drive while distracted). #9 almost seems like it should go with the suicide category, but with a 1 in 289 risk of dying from drug use it is clearly a category that's easy to avoid being a part of. Which means that, excluding the most common natural causes of death and various kinds of accidents and means of self-harm, guns are the single most likely reason for you to die in the USA . Yay! The 25 Most Common Causes of Death (in the USA) If you removed guns from the equation it would also affect the suicide numbers since about twice as many people (i.e. 1 in 150) commit suicide with a firearm. 14.7k Views · View Upvoters Quora User Answered Jan 29, 2017 · Author has 4.6k answers and 9.6m answer views About 11,000 firearms homicides occur in the US. We’ll have to exclude suicides because the question “What are the odds of being shot and killed in the US?” is skewed if one is suicidal, it might be well above 95% if one were to point a gun at oneself and pull the trigger. So we’re talking about being shot and killed by a gun. Well, what the gun control advocates don’t mention is the MAJORITY of people killed in gun violence are gang members and associates, people engaged in criminal activities, and people engaged in high risk activities. So about 5,000 other homicides by firearms remain. Now much of the likely hood of being one of those unfortunates comes down to life choices and occupation. If you’re not a police officer, convenience or liquor store clerk working at night, you’ve reduced it further. Avoiding certain areas is definitely another means of reducing risks. If you don’t live in one of our cesspool cities, you’ve reduced it even more. And if you’ve made common sense choices on spouses, domestic partners and who you let in your life, you’ve reduced it significantly. That said, a friend of my sister’s was working in a department store in the Northern Puget Sound region when a Turkish Moslem walked in and shot her and other people in the head last year. The odds of getting killed by a firearm of people making good choices, not involved in crime, not in bad areas getting shot are very, very small, but when it does happen, it really, really makes the news. 10.1k Views · View Upvoters   Frank Silbermann Answered Mar 31, 2016 · Author has 2.1k answers and 531.7k answer views That's like asking "What are the odds of being sentenced to prison in the US?" or "What are the average American's odds of being appointed Bishop?" You can come up with a statistic of proportional of people shot to death in a given time period, but that says very little about your odds. Regardless of the percentage of people sentenced to prison, a calculation of _your_ odds of being sent to prison is meaningless unless it takes into account whether you do serious crimes. Regardless of the percentage of the general population who become bishops, your odds are virtually zero if you're not a Catholic priest, and even closer to zero if you're not even Catholic. Similarly, your odds of being shot to death primarily depend upon whether you associate with violent people.  If you don't, your odds are far far smaller than the percentage of Americans shot to death.  If you are in a sexual relationship with someone who is very violent, or if you do business with people known to be very violent, or if you socialize with people known to be very violent -- then your odds will be far higher than the percentage of Americans who are shot to death. 5.5k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Ryan Rizner   Damien Leimbach , Competive shooter, former military Answered Oct 13, 2015 · Author has 656 answers and 2.5m answer views well, depends.  If we round down to 300million as the number of people in the country, and estimate about 30,000 people each year die from gunshots, that puts the odds at about 1 in 10K each year. But a huge chunk of those are suicides, and the vast majority of the rest are gang or drug related activity.  So, unless you are a suicidal drug dealer, or intentionally choose to live in extremely high crime areas like the south side of Chicago, you honestly have a greater chance of drowning in a pool or getting killed in a car accident.  Since the number of medical malpractice related deaths are estimated to be upwards of 200,000/year, you actually have a higher chance of being killed by your doctor than you do of getting shot in the US.

Extremely bad odds that we would meet again (highly unlikely )!  Longman's example: What are the odds that they will mess up?  Extremely good odds that the y will mess up (highly likely )!   Extension of Longman's example: What are the odds that they will succeed up?  Extremely bad odds that the y will succeed (highly unlikely )!  Basically, you have to know what the speaker means -- but it's easy: just be a cynic and you'll have the right answer.

That is, not for express surprise but for asking the odds of something!!  Here is an example that I came up with.  (I really want my professor to cancle a class tomorrow, to my classmate) What are the odds of the professor cancelling tomorrow's class??  Thank you so much          Annashin84 ,  May 25, 2011     #13              JamesM  à la Mod (English Only)      Los Angeles, California    English, USA          Yes, it can be used that way as well.  When it is used to express surprise it stands on its own:  "What are the odds!"  When it is part of the larger sentence it is taken more literally.  You are asking how likely it is that the class will be cancelled.

Click to expand...   That is correct usage and meaning.  As you say, simply saying "what are the odds?!?" is also an expression of surprise, but for that context, it is generally used as a stand-alone expression.         eni8ma ,  May 25, 2011     #15              to-toni  Member      Russian          Hello!  I've herd many times this pharse "What's the odds?" when watching amercan movies. And I always thought that the meaning of that is "What is the posibility?" because of the word "odds" used which is an analog of "posibility"...  But recently I've been told that "What's the odds?" is more like "What's the point (in doing smth)?".  So, please, professionals, advise! Thank you very much in advance!         to-toni ,  Nov 30, 2011     #16              ewie  Senior Member      Another Country    English English           Moderator note: Hullo Toni ~ I've merged your question with three previous threads on the same phrase: lots of answers above          ewie ,  Nov 30, 2011     #17              eli7  Senior Member      Tehran; Iran    Persian (Farsi)          In the series "how I met your mother", Tedd sees het girl friend in a shop and he say:" oh, what are the odds!".

It seems like the meanings are different when it is used with a singular verb and plural. When it is used singular it implies that "it is of no use" "it is useless to..".

If you flip a coin, the odds are 50-50 you'll get heads.   When we talk about odds, we're talking about probabilities, specifically, how likely it is that something will happen. Is there a 5% chance? Is there a 95% chance? If there's a 95% chance, then the odds are great. We can talk about the odds of anything happening, as long as it hasn't happened yet. Anyone predicting the weather is telling the odds of rain or snow â€” they don't know for sure. If something strange happens people often say, "What were the odds of that?", which means: "I can't believe that happened. The odds were against it."         Thesaurus         Definitions of odds  1     n the likelihood of a thing occurring rather than not occurring    Type of:   likelihood , likeliness  the probability of a specified outcome        n the ratio by which one better's wager is greater than that of another   “he offered odds of two to one”   Synonyms:  betting odds    Type of:   ratio  the relative magnitudes of two quantities (usually expressed as a quotient)            Word Family    Usage Examples            Sign up, it's free!

Maybe you need a way to get out of a tight squeeze, maybe you want to learn how to win every bet. Whatever you need, a quick game of What Are the Odds? will do the trick.          Steps          1   Decide who is daring first. The first person select another player.          2   Ask the other person, "What are the odds you (insert dare here)? "  The second player reply with a number up to 25. Do not go over 25.           3   Both players face each other. Count down from three simultaneously.         4   At one, both players say at the same time a number between one and the number that was selected by the second player.          5   Determine the winner.   If both players say the same number, the person who was dared now has to complete the dare.  If two different numbers are said, the second player does not have to complete the dare.           6   Move on to the next round or end the game. The second player now has a turn to ask, "What are the odds?"

What are the odds of that?   Each outcome is a rare one. That may sound like a simple question, but it isn’t.  Some would answer the question by stating that the odds of a roulette wheel landing on the number 19 on seven consecutive spins is a simple math problem.  There are 38 numbered pockets on an American roulette wheel, so the odds of a ball landing on 19 in one spin of the wheel would be 1 in 38.  The odds of that happening seven straight times would simply be (1/38)^7, or 1 in 114 billion. 1   An equally plausible response would be that we don’t care that the wheel landed on “19” in seven straight spins, but rather that it landed on the same number for seven straight spins.  In that case, what we really want to know is the likelihood that the wheel lands on any number (odds: 38/38, or 100%) and then lands on that same number again on the next six spins (odds: (1/38)^6).  The odds of that happening are 1 in 3 billion.  But it’s not that simple, either. The question “What are the odds of that?” can, and often should, be interpreted differently. What are the odds of a roulette wheel, on seven consecutive spins, landing in the following order: 10-34-3-9-18-30-21. Take a second and think about that.  …   The answer is 1 in 114 billion. It is 38 times as likely for a roulette wheel to land on the same number seven times in a row than it is to land in the sequence 10-34-3-9-18-30-21.  That’s because 19-19-19-19-19-19-19 is just as likely as 10-34-3-9-18-30-21.  It may not feel that way to you, because 10-34-3-9-18-30-21 isn’t substantially different to you than 4-22-9-30-2-36-18, or a host of other seemingly random results.  Or, as Doug described, consider what happens if you flip a coin ten times and get THHHTTHHTH. What are the odds of that?  “What are the odds of that” is a question that sounds straightforward but is rather complex.  It depends on what you think is the essence of a sequence of coin flips. The odds of getting exactly THHHTTHHTH is 1 in 1024.  But that probably isn’t the essence of the sequence that you are curious about: your chances of getting 6 heads and 4 tails is about 20.5%, and the probability of a 6/4 split one way or the other is about 41%. THHHTTHHTH may be a rare outcome — just like 10-34-3-9-18-30-21 — but every single sequence is a rare outcome when flipping a coin 10 times. Usually, we’re often not interested in the outcome itself . Instead we group outcomes together into the events that we’re interested in. We might be interested in the event “six of one, four of the other,” which consists of a lot of different outcomes. That event is not particularly rare.  Remember my Splits Happen post?  What were the odds that Jacoby Jones would gain three times as many receiving yards against the 8 teams at the back of the alphabet as he would against the 8 teams he faced in the front of the alphabet?  It depends on your perspective.  The actual odds of that specific outcome would be extremely rare, much like THHHTTHHTH.  But the odds that one receiver in the NFL would have a crazy split like that?  Not odd at all, in fact.  With a large enough sample size, it’s bound to happen, which is why I was able to find three other examples in that article.  This is a very good reason why it’s often inappropriate to apply standard significance tests to football statistics. Surely Jones’ splits would pass any standard significance test, signaling that his wild split was in fact “real” even though we know it wasn’t.  With a large enough sample, you would expect to have false positives, which isn’t a knock on standard significant testing.  If something is statistically significant at the 1% level, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t expect to see a false positive if you have 100 different samples.  Scott Kacsmar has written that Aaron Rodgers has a miserable 3-18 record at 4th quarter comeback opportunities , a rate far, far below that of other elite quarterbacks.  Does this mean Rodgers is inherently bad at 4th quarter comebacks?  Maybe so.  You could make some assumptions and run the numbers; maybe you’d find that there is only a 1% 2 chance of Rodgers having such a terrible 4th quarter comeback record if he was as good as other elite quarterbacks in those situations.  So you would confidently conclude: the probability of Rodgers’ record having happened due to chance is extremely low. Therefore, it probably isn’t just chance; he must be inherently bad at 4th quarter comebacks.  . Brett Favre isn't the only one surprised Aaron Rodgers hasn't recorded his fourth 4th quarter comeback yet But that isn’t necessarily appropriate. Even if all elite quarterbacks, Rodgers included, had the exact same odds when it came to 4th quarter comeback opportunities, and therefore chance was completely responsible for any discrepancy in the results, over time, there would undoubtedly still be an elite quarterback like Rodgers who would have that 3-18 record (about 1% of all star quarterbacks, in fact!).  Do you see why?  Some in the statistical community refer to this as the Wyatt Earp Effect.  You’ve undoubtedly heard of Wyatt Earp, who is famous precisely because he survived a large number of duels. What are the odds of that? Well, it depends on your perspective.  The odds that one person would survive a large number of duels?  Given enough time, it becomes a statistical certainty that someone would do just that.  Think back to the famous Warren Buffett debate on the efficient market hypothesis.  Suppose that 225 million Americans partake in a single elimination national coin-flipping contest, with one coin flip per day.  After 20 days, we would expect 215 people to successfully call their coin flips 20 times out of 20.   But that doesn’t mean those 215 people are any better at calling coins than you or I am.  The Wyatt Earp Effect, the National Coin Flipping Example, and my Splits Happen post all illustrate the same principle. Asking “what are the odds of that?” is often meaningless in retrospect. If you look at enough things, enough players’ splits, enough 4th quarter comeback opportunities, enough coin flips, or enough roulette wheel spins, you will see some things that seem absurdly unlikely.  This isn’t to say that Rodgers isn’t particularly bad at 4th quarter comebacks, as the data suggest.  It’s just a reminder that the question “What are the odds of that?” is rarely a straightforward math question, and temptations of the Wyatt Earp trap are often extremely tantalizing and difficult to ignore.  What are the odds of a Roulette Wheel landing on 19 on seven straight spins?  One answer is 1 in 114 billion.  But with 10,000 roulette wheels across America being played virtually non-stop, we would expect one casino in American to hit the same number on 7 spins in a row about once every 15 months .  I am blurring, and will continue to blur, the distinction between odds and probability. Nothing bad will happen as a result. [ ↩ ] If you assume Rodgers has a 40% chance of succeeding at 4th quarter comebacks — arguably a low estimate for star quarterbacks — then there is only a 1% chance that he would win 3 or fewer times in 21 opportunities.

What are the odds that you exist, as you, today? Author Ali Binazir attemps to quantify the probability that you came about and exist as you today, and reveals that the odds of you existing are almost zero.  LET'S START SMALL What is the probability of your dad meeting your mom? Though the world was smaller 20 years ago, your dad could have met almost 200 million of its women (go dad!) But over 25 years, he probably met around 10,000 women. So the odds that your mom was in this small group and met your dad is: 1 in 20,000  BUT WE KNOW HOW TRICKY LOVE CAN BE. What is the probability that they stay together long enough to have kids? It is a 1 in 10 chance that they talk to each other. Also a 1 in 10 chance that they go on a second date. Another 1 in 10 chance that they keep dating for a while. And a coin toss if they stay together long enough for offspring. Thus, the odds that your parents' meeting results in kids is: 1 in 2,000  So far, the combines odds of you being here are: 1 in 40,000,000 That is about the size of the population of California.  NOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET PRETTY INTERESTING Why? Because we are about to deal with eggs and sperm, which come in large numbers. Mom has about 100,000 eggs in her lifetime. Dad makes about 4 trillion sperm during the years you could have been born.  What are the odds that the 1 egg... (Sally)... ...met the 1 sperm, which together made you(and not your brother)? (Harry) 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 400 quadrillion)That is approximately the volume in cubic meters of the Atlantic Ocean (3,236x10 17 cubic meters).  BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED Because your existence here, now, and on planet earth presupposes another supremely unlikely and utterly undeniable chain of events. Namely, that every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age- going all the way back not just to the first Homo sapiens, first Homo erectus and Homo habilis, but all the way back to the first single-celled organism. You are a representative of an unbroken lineage of life going back 4 billion years.  What are the odds that you lineage remained unbroken for the length of human existence? (You.Aw.) 1 in 2 odds that a child will be born, grow, and reproduce per generation... ... for 150,000 generations  1 in 10  45,000 That's a 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it.  How large is that number? That number is not just larger than all the particles in the universe-it is larger that all the particles in the universe if each particle were itself a universe.  THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. The right sperm also had to meet the right egg for every single one of those ancestors.  (Weeeee!) ODDS OF THE RIGHT SPERM, MEETING THE RIGHT EGG 150,000 TIMES? 1 in 10 2,640,000 That is 1 quadrillion multiplied by 1 quadrillion for every generation.  Let's add it all up  10 2,640,000 x 10 45,000 x 2000 x 20,000= 1 in 10 2,685,000  BY COMPARISON: The number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg. 175 lb) is about: 10 27 The number of atoms making up the earth is about: 10 50 The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at: 10 80  THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: It is the probability of 2 million people getting together (about the population of San Diego) each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up with the exact same number-for example, 550,343,279,001.  SO, THE ODDS THAT YOU EXIST AT ALL ARE: BASICALLY ZERO.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, we have just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and ac like the miracle that you are.

For the alternative rock band, see Odds (band) .  "Odds against" redirects here. For the 1966 documentary film, see The Odds Against .     Look up odds in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details. (March 2016)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Odds are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics . In statistics, the odds for or odds of some event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while odds against reflect the likelihood that it will not. In gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event. [1] [2] Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event.  In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. [3] Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker ) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. In simplest terms, 6 to 1 odds means if you bet a dollar (the "1" in the expression), and you win you get paid six dollars (the "6" in the expression), or 6 x 1. If you bet two dollars you would be paid twelve dollars, or 6 x 2. If you bet three dollars and win, you would be paid eighteen dollars, or 6 x 3. If you bet one hundred dollars and win you would be paid six hundred dollars, or 6 x 100. If you lose any of those bets you would lose the dollar, or two dollars, or three dollars, or one hundred dollars.  In statistics, the odds for an event E are defined as a simple function of the probability of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the uncertainty of this possible event as odds for is that to regain the probability requires a calculation. The natural way to interpret odds for (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) odds for rolling six with a fair die (one of a pair of dice ) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 six event for every 5 times the die does not show six. For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 sixes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) odds against, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the odds against rolling a six with a fair die are 5 to 1. The probability of rolling a six with a fair die is the single number 1/6, roughly 0.17.  The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a six will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a six and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a six, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a six and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no advantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. Casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the United States. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.

[4] Shakespeare wrote:   Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one  — William Shakespeare , Henry IV, Part II , Act I, Scene 1 lines 181–2.   The sixteenth century polymath Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes [5] ).  Terminology [ edit ]  Odds are expressed in the form X to Y, where X and Y are numbers. Usually, the word "to" is replaced by a symbol for ease of use. This is conventionally either a slash or hyphen , although a colon is sometimes seen. Thus, 6/1, 6-1 and 6:1 are all interchangeable.  Odds against [ edit ]  When the probability that the event will not happen is greater than the probability that it will, then the odds are "against" that event happening. Odds of 6 to 1, for example, are therefore sometimes said to be "6 to 1 against ". To a gambler, "odds against" means that the amount he or she will win is greater than the amount staked.  Odds on [ edit ]  "Odds on" is the opposite of "odds against". It means that the event is more likely to happen than not. This is sometimes expressed with the smaller number first (1 to 2) but more often using the word "on" ("2 to 1 on ") meaning that the event is twice as likely to happen as not. Note that the gambler who bets at "odds on" and wins will still be in profit, as his stake will be returned. For example, on a $2 bet, the gambler will be given $1 plus the returned stake of $2, yielding a $1 profit.  Even odds [ edit ]  Main article: Even money  "Even odds" occur when the probability of an event happening is exactly the same as it not happening. In common parlance, this is a "50-50 chance". Guessing heads or tails on a coin toss is the classic example of an event that has even odds. In gambling, it is commonly referred to as " even money " or simply "evens" (1 to 1, or 2 for 1). "Evens" implies that the payout will be one unit per unit wagered plus the original stake, that is, "double-your-money".  Better than/worse than evens [ edit ]  The term "better than evens" (or "worse than evens") varies in meaning depending on context. Looked at from the perspective of a gambler rather than a statistician, "better than evens" means "odds against". If the odds are evens (1:1), and one bets 10 units, one would be returned 20 units, making a profit of 10 units. If the gamble was paying 4:1 and the event occurred, one would make 50 units, or a profit of 40 units. So, it is "better than evens" from the gambler's perspective because it pays out more than one-for-one. If an event is more likely to occur than an even chance, then the odds will be "worse than evens", and the bookmaker will pay out less than one-for-one.  However, in popular parlance surrounding uncertain events, the expression "better than evens" usually implies a greater than 50% chance of the event occurring, which is exactly the opposite of the meaning of the expression when used in a gaming context.  Statistical usage [ edit ]  In statistics, odds are an expression of relative probabilities, generally quoted as the odds in favor . The odds (in favor) of an event or a proposition is the ratio of the probability that the event will happen to the probability that the event will not happen. Mathematically, this is a Bernoulli trial , as it has exactly two outcomes. In case of a finite sample space of equally likely outcomes , this is the ratio of the number of outcomes where the event occurs to the number of outcomes where the event does not occur; these can be represented as W and L (for Wins and Losses) or S and F (for Success and Failure). For example, the odds that a randomly chosen day of the week is a weekend are two to five (2:5), as days of the week form a sample space of seven outcomes, and the event occurs for two of the outcomes (Saturday and Sunday), and not for the other five. [6] [7] Conversely, given odds as a ratio of integers, this can be represented by a probability space of a finite number of equally likely outcomes. These definitions are equivalent, since dividing both terms in the ratio by the number of outcomes yields the probabilities:     2  :  5  =  (  2   /   7  )  :  (  5   /   7  )  .    {\displaystyle 2:5=(2/7):(5/7).}   Conversely, the odds against is the opposite ratio. For example, the odds against a random day of the week being a weekend are 5:2.  Odds and probability can be expressed in prose via the prepositions to and in: "odds of so many to so many on (or against) [some event]" refers to odds – the ratio of numbers of (equally likely) outcomes in favor and against (or vice versa); "chances of so many [outcomes], in so many [outcomes]" refers to probability – the number of (equally like) outcomes in favour relative to the number for and against combined. For example, "odds of a weekend are 2 to 5", while "chances of a weekend are 2 in 7". In casual use, the words odds and chances (or chance ) are often used interchangeably to vaguely indicate some measure of odds or probability, though the intended meaning can be deduced by noting whether the preposition between the two numbers is to or in . [8] [9] [10]  Mathematical relations [ edit ]  Odds can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, in which case it is not unique – scaling both terms by the same factor does not change the proportions: 1:1 odds and 100:100 odds are the same (even odds). Odds can also be expressed as a number, by dividing the terms in the ratio – in this case it is unique (different fractions can represent the same rational number ). Odds as a ratio, odds as a number, and probability (also a number) are related by simple formulas, and similarly odds in favor and odds against, and probability of success and probability of failure have simple relations. Odds range from 0 to infinity, while probabilities range from 0 to 1, and hence are often represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%: reversing the ratio switches odds for with odds against, and similarly probability of success with probability of failure.  Given odds (in favor) as the ratio W:L (Wins:Losses), the odds in favor (as a number)      o   f      {\displaystyle o_{f}}   and odds against (as a number)      o   a      {\displaystyle o_{a}}   can be computed by simply dividing, and are multiplicative inverses :            o   f       =  W   /   L  =  1   /    o   a         o   a       =  L   /   W  =  1   /    o   f         o   f    ⋅   o   a       =  1        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}o_{f}&=W/L=1/o_{a}\\o_{a}&=L/W=1/o_{f}\\o_{f}\cdot o_{a}&=1\end{aligned}}}     Analogously, given odds as a ratio, the probability of success or failure can be computed by dividing, and the probability of success and probability of failure sum to unity (one), as they are the only possible outcomes. In case of a finite number of equally likely outcomes, this can be interpreted as the number of outcomes where the event occurs divided by the total number of events:           p     =  W   /   (  W  +  L  )  =  1  −  q      q     =  L   /   (  W  +  L  )  =  1  −  p      p  +  q     =  1        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=W/(W+L)=1-q\\q&=L/(W+L)=1-p\\p+q&=1\end{aligned}}}     Given a probability p, the odds as a ratio is     p  :  q    {\displaystyle p:q}   (probability of success to probability of failure), and the odds as numbers can be computed by dividing:            o   f       =  p   /   q  =  p   /   (  1  −  p  )  =  (  1  −  q  )   /   q       o   a       =  q   /   p  =  (  1  −  p  )   /   p  =  q   /   (  1  −  q  )        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}o_{f}&=p/q=p/(1-p)=(1-q)/q\\o_{a}&=q/p=(1-p)/p=q/(1-q)\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, given the odds as a number      o   f    ,    {\displaystyle o_{f},}   this can be represented as the ratio      o   f    :  1  ,    {\displaystyle o_{f}:1,}   or conversely     1  :  (  1   /    o   f    )  =  1  :   o   a    ,    {\displaystyle 1:(1/o_{f})=1:o_{a},}   from which the probability of success or failure can be computed:           p     =   o   f     /   (   o   f    +  1  )  =  1   /   (   o   a    +  1  )      q     =   o   a     /   (   o   a    +  1  )  =  1   /   (   o   f    +  1  )        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=o_{f}/(o_{f}+1)=1/(o_{a}+1)\\q&=o_{a}/(o_{a}+1)=1/(o_{f}+1)\end{aligned}}}     Thus if expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1, probability and odds differ by exactly 1 in the denominator: a probability of 1 in 100 (1/100 = 1%) is the same as odds of 1 to 99 (1/99 = 0.0101… = 0. 01 ), while odds of 1 to 100 (1/100 = 0.01) is the same as a probability of 1 in 101 (1/101 = 0.00990099… = 0. 0099 ). This is a minor difference if the probability is small (close to zero, or "long odds"), but is a major difference if the probability is large (close to one).  These are worked out for some simple odds:    odds (ratio)       o   f      {\displaystyle o_{f}}         o   a      {\displaystyle o_{a}}        p    {\displaystyle p}        q    {\displaystyle q}      1:1  1  1  50%  50%    0:1  0  ∞  0%  100%    1:0  ∞  0  100%  0%    2:1  2  0.5  67%  33%    1:2  0.5  2  33%  67%    4:1  4  0.25  80%  20%    1:4  0.25  4  20%  80%       9:1  9  0. 1  90%  10%    10:1  10  0.1  90. 90 %  9. 09 %    99:1  99  0. 01  99%  1%    100:1  100  0.01  99. 0099 %  0. 90 %    These transforms have certain special geometric properties: the conversions between odds for and odds against (resp. probability of success with probability of failure) and between odds and probability are all Möbius transformations (fractional linear transformations). They are thus specified by three points ( sharply 3-transitive ). Swapping odds for and odds against swaps 0 and infinity, fixing 1, while swapping probability of success with probability of failure swaps 0 and 1, fixing .5; these are both order 2, hence circular transforms . Converting odds to probability fixes 0, sends infinity to 1, and sends 1 to .5 (even odds are 50% likely), and conversely; this is a parabolic transform .  Applications [ edit ]  In probability theory and Bayesian statistics , odds may sometimes be more natural or more convenient than probabilities. This is often the case in problems of sequential decision making as for instance in problems of how to stop (online) on a last specific event which is solved by the odds algorithm . Similar ratios are used elsewhere in Bayesian statistics, such as the Bayes factor .  The odds are a ratio of probabilities; an odds ratio is a ratio of odds, that is, a ratio of ratios of probabilities. Odds-ratios are often used in analysis of clinical trials . While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter- intuitive results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is four times more likely to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the odds are 16 times higher on the less likely event (4–1 against , or 4) than on the more likely one (1–4, or 4–1 on , or 0.25).  In some cases the log-odds are used, which is the logit of the probability. Most simply, odds are frequently multiplied or divided, and log converts multiplication to addition and division to subtractions.   Example #1  There are 5 pink marbles, 2 blue marbles, and 8 purple marbles. What are the odds in favor of picking a blue marble?   Answer: The odds in favour of a blue marble are 2:13. One can equivalently say, that the odds are 13:2 against . There are 2 out of 15 chances in favour of blue, 13 out of 15 against blue.  In probability theory and statistics , where the variable p is the probability in favor of a binary event, and the probability against the event is therefore 1- p , "the odds" of the event are the quotient of the two, or       p   1  −  p       {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{1-p}}}   . That value may be regarded as the relative probability the event will happen, expressed as a fraction (if it is less than 1), or a multiple (if it is equal to or greater than one) of the likelihood that the event will not happen.  In the very first example at top, saying the odds of a Sunday are "one to six" or, less commonly, "one-sixth" means the probability of picking a Sunday randomly is one-sixth the probability of not picking a Sunday. While the mathematical probability of an event has a value in the range from zero to one, "the odds" in favor of that same event lie between zero and infinity. The odds against the event with probability given as p are        1  −  p   p      {\displaystyle {\frac {1-p}{p}}}   . The odds against Sunday are 6:1 or  6/1 = 6. It is 6 times as likely that a random day is not a Sunday.   Example #2  There are 5 red marbles, 2 green marbles, and 8 yellow marbles. What are the odds against picking a yellow marble?   Answer: 7:8  Gambling usage [ edit ]  The use of odds in gambling facilitates betting on events where the relative probabilities of outcomes varied. For example, on a coin toss or a match race between two evenly matched horses, it is reasonable for two people to wager level stakes. However, in more variable situations, such as a multi-runner horse race or a football match between two unequally matched sides, betting "at odds" provides a perspective on the relative likelihoods of the possible outcomes.  In the modern era, most fixed odds betting takes place between a betting organisation, such as a bookmaker , and an individual, rather than between individuals. Different traditions have grown up in how to express odds to customers, older eras came with betting odds between people, today which is illegal in most countries, it was referred as "odding", an underground slang word with origins based in the Bronx.  Fractional odds [ edit ]  Favoured by bookmakers in the United Kingdom and Ireland , and also common in horse racing , fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the bettor, should he or she win, relative to the stake. [11] Odds of 4/1 would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake. If the odds are 1/4, the bettor will make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, having won, the bettor always receives the original stake back; so if the odds are 4/1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as evens or even money .  The numerator and denominator of fractional odds are always integers , thus if the bookmaker's payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator . For example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.  Fractional odds are also known as British odds,  UK odds, [12] or, in that country, traditional odds . They are typically represented with a "/" but can also be represented with a "-", e.g. 4/1 or 4-1. Odds with a denominator of 1 are often presented in listings as the numerator only. [ citation needed ]  A variation of fractional odds is known as Hong Kong odds. Fractional and Hong Kong odds are actually exchangeable. The only difference is that the UK odds are presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong odds are decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.  The European odds also represent the potential winnings (net returns), but in addition they factor in the stake (e.g. 6/5 or 1.2 plus 1 = 2.2). [13]  Decimal odds [ edit ]  Favoured in continental Europe , Australia , New Zealand and Canada , decimal odds quote the ratio of the payout amount, including the original stake, to the stake itself. [14] Decimal odds are generally considered the easiest to deal with as they reflect the inverse of the probability of an outcome. [15] Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one. [16] Thus even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2.00. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5.00, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. This is considered to be ideal for parlay betting, because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on. Decimal odds are also favoured by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading.  Decimal odds are also known as European odds , digital odds or continental odds. [12]  Moneyline odds [ edit ]  Main article: moneyline odds  Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. The figure quoted is either positive or negative.   When moneyline odds are positive, the figure indicates how much money will be won on a $100 wager (this is done for an outcome that is considered less likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 4/1 would be quoted as +400.  When moneyline odds are negative, the figure indicates how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done for an outcome is considered more likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 1/4 would be quoted as -400.   Moneyline odds are often referred to as American odds . A "Moneyline" wager refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread . In most cases, the favorite will have negative moneyline odds (less payoff for a safer bet) and the underdog will have positive moneyline odds (more payoff for a risky bet). However, if the teams are evenly matched, both teams can have a negative line at the same time (e.g. -110 -110 or -105 -115), due to house take.  Gambling odds versus probabilities [ edit ]  Main article: Mathematics of bookmaking  In gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the bookmaker will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. In formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful bettor is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. This profit is known as the 'over-round' on the 'book' (the 'book' refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term 'bookmaker') and relates to the sum of the 'odds' in the following way:  In a 3-horse race, for example, the true probabilities of each of the horses winning based on their relative abilities may be 50%, 40% and 10%. The total of these three percentages is 100%, thus representing a fair 'book'. The true odds against winning for each of the three horses are 1-1, 3-2 and 9-1 respectively.  In order to generate a profit on the wagers accepted, the bookmaker may decide to increase the values to 60%, 50% and 20% for the three horses, respectively. This represents the odds against each, which are 4-6, 1-1 and 4-1, in order. These values now total 130%, meaning that the book has an overround of 30 (130−100). This value of 30 represents the amount of profit for the bookmaker if he gets bets in good proportions on each of the horses. For example, if he takes £60, £50, and £20 of stakes respectively for the three horses, he receives £130 in wagers but only pays £100 back (including stakes), whichever horse wins. And the expected value of his profit is positive even if everybody bets on the same horse. The art of bookmaking is in setting the odds low enough so as to have a positive expected value of profit while keeping the odds high enough to attract customers, and at the same time attracting enough bets for each outcome to reduce his risk exposure.  A study on soccer betting found that the probability for the home team to win was generally about 3.4% less than the value calculated from the odds (for example, 46.6% for even odds). It was about 3.7% less for wins by the visitors, and 5.7% less for draws. [17]  Making a profit in gambling involves predicting the relationship of the true probabilities to the payout odds. Sports information services are often used by professional and semi-professional sports bettors to help achieve this goal.  The odds or amounts the bookmaker will pay are determined by the total amount that has been bet on all of the possible events. They reflect the balance of wagers on either side of the event, and include the deduction of a bookmaker's brokerage fee ("vig" or vigorish ).  Also, depending on how the betting is affected by jurisdiction, taxes may be involved for the bookmaker and/or the winning player. This may be taken into account when offering the odds and/or may reduce the amount won by a player.

At about the same time, Don C. Wiley mysteriously disappeared. His car, a white rented Mitsubishi Galant, was abandoned on a bridge outside of Memphis, where he had just had a jovial dinner with friends. The following week, Vladimir Pasechnik collapsed in London, apparently of a stroke. The list would grow to nearly a dozen in the space of four nerve-jangling months. Stabbed in Leesburg, Va. Suffocated in an air-locked lab in Geelong, Australia. Found wedged under a chair, naked from the waist down, in a blood-splattered apartment in Norwich, England. Hit by a car while jogging. Killed in a private plane crash. Shot dead while a pizza delivery man served as a decoy. What joined these men was their proximity to the world of bioterror and germ warfare. Que, the one who was car-jacked, was a researcher at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Wiley, the most famous, knew as much as anyone about how the immune system responds to attacks from viruses like Ebola. Pasechnik was Russian, and before he defected, he helped the Soviets transform cruise missiles into biological weapons. The chain of deaths -- these three men and eight others like them -- began last fall, back when emergency teams in moonsuits were scouring the Capitol, when postal workers were dying, when news agencies were on high alert and the entire nation was afraid to open its mail. In more ordinary times, this cluster of deaths might not have been noticed, but these are not ordinary times. Neighbors report neighbors to the F.B.I.; passengers are escorted off planes because they make other passengers nervous; medical journals debate what to publish, for fear the articles will be read by evil eyes. Now we are spooked and startled by stories like these -- all these scientists dying within months of one another, at the precise moment when tiny organisms loom as a gargantuan threat. The stories of these dozen or so deaths started out as a curiosity and were transformed rumor by rumor into the specter of conspiracy as they circulated first on the Internet and then in the mainstream media. What are the odds, after all?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   What are the odds, indeed? For this is not about conspiracy but about coincidence -- unexpected connections that are both riveting and rattling. Much religious faith is based on the idea that almost nothing is coincidence; science is an exercise in eliminating the taint of coincidence; police work is often a feint and parry between those trying to prove coincidence and those trying to prove complicity. Without coincidence, there would be few movies worth watching (''Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine''), and literary plots would come grinding to a disappointing halt. (What if Oedipus had not happened to marry his mother? If Javert had not happened to arrive in the town where Valjean was mayor?)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The true meaning of the word is ''a surprising concurrence of events, perceived as meaningfully related, with no apparent causal connection.'' In other words, pure happenstance. Yet by merely noticing a coincidence, we elevate it to something that transcends its definition as pure chance. We are discomforted by the idea of a random universe. Like Mel Gibson's character Graham Hess in M. Night Shyamalan's new movie ''Signs,'' we want to feel that our lives are governed by a grand plan. The need is especially strong in an age when paranoia runs rampant. ''Coincidence feels like a loss of control perhaps,'' says John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple University and the author of ''Innumeracy,'' the improbable best seller about how Americans don't understand numbers. Finding a reason or a pattern where none actually exists ''makes it less frightening,'' he says, because events get placed in the realm of the logical. ''Believing in fate, or even conspiracy, can sometimes be more comforting than facing the fact that sometimes things just happen.'' In the past year there has been plenty of conspiracy, of course, but also a lot of things have ''just happened.'' And while our leaders are out there warning us to be vigilant, the statisticians are out there warning that patterns are not always what they seem. We need to be reminded, Paulos and others say, that most of the time patterns that seem stunning to us aren't even there. For instance, although the numbers 9/11 (9 plus 1 plus 1) equal 11, and American Airlines Flight 11 was the first to hit the twin towers, and there were 92 people on board (9 plus 2), and Sept. 11 is the 254th day of the year (2 plus 5 plus 4), and there are 11 letters each in ''Afghanistan,'' ''New York City'' and ''the Pentagon'' (and while we're counting, in George W. Bush), and the World Trade towers themselves took the form of the number 11, this seeming numerical message is not actually a pattern that exists but merely a pattern we have found. (After all, the second flight to hit the towers was United Airlines Flight 175, and the one that hit the Pentagon was American Airlines Flight 77, and the one that crashed in a Pennsylvania field was United Flight 93, and the Pentagon is shaped, well, like a pentagon.) The same goes for the way we think of miraculous intervention. We need to be told that those lucky last-minute stops for an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's or to pick up a watch at the repair shop or to vote in the mayoral primary -- stops that saved lives of people who would otherwise have been in the towers when the first plane hit -- certainly looked like miracles but could have been predicted by statistics. So, too, can the most breathtaking of happenings -- like the sparrow that happened to appear at one memorial service just as a teenage boy, at the lectern eulogizing his mom, said the word ''mother.'' The tiny bird lighted on the boy's head; then he took it in his hand and set it free. Something like that has to be more than coincidence, we protest. What are the odds? The mathematician will answer that even in the most unbelievable situations, the odds are actually very good. The law of large numbers says that with a large enough denominator -- in other words, in a big wide world -- stuff will happen, even very weird stuff. ''The really unusual day would be one where nothing unusual happens,'' explains Persi Diaconis, a Stanford statistician who has spent his career collecting and studying examples of coincidence. Given that there are 280 million people in the United States, he says, ''280 times a day, a one-in-a-million shot is going to occur.'' Throw your best story at him -- the one about running into your childhood playmate on a street corner in Azerbaijan or marrying a woman who has a birthmark shaped like a shooting star that is a perfect match for your own or dreaming that your great-aunt Lucy would break her collarbone hours before she actually does -- and he will nod politely and answer that such things happen all the time. In fact, he and his colleagues also warn me that although I pulled all examples in the prior sentence from thin air, I will probably get letters from readers saying one of those things actually happened to them. And what of the deaths of nearly a dozen scientists? Is it really possible that they all just happened to die, most in such peculiar, jarring ways, within so short a time? ''We can never say for a fact that something isn't a conspiracy,'' says Bradley Efron, a professor of statistics at Stanford. ''We can just point out the odds that it isn't.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I first found myself wondering about coincidence last spring when I read a small news item out of the tiny Finnish town of Raahe, which is 370 miles north of Helsinki. On the morning of March 5, two elderly twin brothers were riding their bicycles, as was their habit, completing their separate errands. At 9:30, one brother was struck by a truck along coastal Highway 8 and killed instantly. About two hours later and one mile down the same highway, the other brother was struck by a second truck and killed. ''It was hard to believe this could happen just by chance,'' says Marko Salo, the senior constable who investigated both deaths for the Raahe Police Department. Instead, the department looked for a cause, thinking initially that the second death was really a suicide. ''Almost all Raahe thought he did it knowing that his brother was dead,'' Salo says of the second brother's death. ''They thought he tried on purpose. That would have explained things.'' But the investigation showed that the older brother was off cheerfully getting his hair cut just before his own death. The family could not immediately accept that this was random coincidence, either. ''It was their destiny,'' offers their nephew, who spoke with me on behalf of the family. It is his opinion that his uncles shared a psychic bond throughout their lives. When one brother became ill, the other one fell ill shortly thereafter. When one reached to scratch his nose, the other would often do the same. Several years ago, one brother was hit and injured by a car (also while biking), and the other one developed pain in the same leg. The men's sister had still another theory entirely. ''She worried that it was a plot to kill both of them,'' the nephew says, describing his aunt's concerns that terrorists might have made their way to Raahe. ''She was angry. She wanted to blame someone. So she said the chances of this happening by accident are impossible.'' Not true, the statisticians say. But before we can see the likelihood for what it is, we have to eliminate the distracting details. We are far too taken, Efron says, with superfluous facts and findings that have no bearing on the statistics of coincidence. After our initial surprise, Efron says that the real yardstick for measuring probability is ''How surprised should we be?'' How surprising is it, to use this example, that two 70-year-old men in the same town should die within two hours of each other? Certainly not common, but not unimaginable. But the fact that they were brothers would seem to make the odds more astronomical. This, however, is a superfluous fact. What is significant in their case is that two older men were riding bicycles along a busy highway in a snowstorm, which greatly increases the probability that they would be hit by trucks. Statisticians like Efron emphasize that when something striking happens, it only incidentally happens to us. When the numbers are large enough, and the distracting details are removed, the chance of anything is fairly high. Imagine a meadow, he says, and then imagine placing your finger on a blade of grass. The chance of choosing exactly that blade of grass would be one in a million or even higher, but because it is a certainty that you will choose a blade of grass, the odds of one particular one being chosen are no more or less than the one to either side. Robert J. Tibshirani, a statistician at Stanford University who proved that it was probably not coincidence that accident rates increase when people simultaneously drive and talk on a cellphone, leading some states to ban the practice, uses the example of a hand of poker. ''The chance of getting a royal flush is very low,'' he says, ''and if you were to get a royal flush, you would be surprised. But the chance of any hand in poker is low. You just don't notice when you get all the others; you notice when you get the royal flush.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   When these professors talk, they do so slowly, aware that what they are saying is deeply counterintuitive. No sooner have they finished explaining that the world is huge and that any number of unlikely things are likely to happen than they shift gears and explain that the world is also quite small, which explains an entire other type of coincidence. One relatively simple example of this is ''the birthday problem.'' There are as many as 366 days in a year (accounting for leap years), and so you would have to assemble 367 people in a room to absolutely guarantee that two of them have the same birthday. But how many people would you need in that room to guarantee a 50 percent chance of at least one birthday match? Intuitively, you assume that the answer should be a relatively large number. And in fact, most people's first guess is 183, half of 366. But the actual answer is 23. In Paulos's book, he explains the math this way: ''[T]he number of ways in which five dates can be chosen (allowing for repetitions) is (365 x 365 x 365 x 365 x 365). Of all these 3655 ways, however, only (365 x 364 x 363 x 362 x 361) are such that no two of the dates are the same; any of the 365 days can be chosen first, any of the remaining 364 can be chosen second and so on. Thus, by dividing this latter product (365 x 364 x 363 x 362 x 361) by 3655, we get the probability that five persons chosen at random will have no birthday in common. Now, if we subtract this probability from 1 (or from 100 percent if we're dealing with percentages), we get the complementary probability that at least two of the five people do have a birthday in common. A similar calculation using 23 rather than 5 yields 1/2, or 50 percent, as the probability that at least 2 of 23 people will have a common birthday.'' Got that? Using similar math, you can calculate that if you want even odds of finding two people born within one day of each other, you only need 14 people, and if you are looking for birthdays a week apart, the magic number is seven. (Incidentally, if you are looking for an even chance that someone in the room will have your exact birthday, you will need 253 people.) And yet despite numbers like these, we are constantly surprised when we meet a stranger with whom we share a birth date or a hometown or a middle name. We are amazed by the overlap -- and we conveniently ignore the countless things we do not have in common. which brings us to the death of Benito Que, who was not, despite reports to the contrary, actually a microbiologist. He was a researcher in a lab at the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center, where he was testing various agents as potential cancer drugs. He never worked with anthrax or any infectious disease, according to Dr. Bach Ardalan, a professor of medicine at the University of Miami and Que's boss for the past three years. ''There is no truth to the talk that Benito was doing anything related to microbiology,'' Ardalan says. ''He certainly wasn't doing any sensitive kind of work that anyone would want to hurt him for.'' But those facts got lost amid the confusion -- and the prevalence of very distracting details -- in the days after he died. So did the fact that he had hypertension. On the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19, Que attended a late-afternoon lab meeting, and as it ended, he mentioned that he hadn't been feeling well. A nurse took Que's blood pressure, which was 190/110. ''I wanted to admit him'' to the hospital, Ardalan says, but Que insisted on going home. Que had the habit of parking his car on Northwest 10th Avenue, a side street that Ardalan describes as being ''beyond the area considered to be safe.'' His spot that day was in front of a house where a young boy was playing outside. Four youths approached Que as he neared his car, the boy later told the police, and there might have been some baseball bats involved. When the police arrived, they found Que unconscious. His briefcase was at his side, but his wallet was gone. His car was eventually found abandoned several miles from the scene. He was taken to the hospital, the same one at which he worked, where he spent more than a week in a coma before dying without ever regaining consciousness. The mystery, limited to small items in local Florida papers at first, was ''What killed Benito Que?'' Could it have been the mugging? A CAT scan showed no signs of bony fracture. In fact, there were no scrapes or bruises or other physical signs of assault. Perhaps he died of a stroke? His brain scan did show a ''huge intracranial bleed,'' Ardalan says, which would have explained his earlier headache, and his high blood pressure would have made a stroke likely. In other words, this man just happened to be mugged when he was a stroke waiting to be triggered. That is a jarring coincidence, to be sure. But it is not one that the world was likely to have noticed if Don Wiley had not up and disappeared.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Don C. Wiley was a microbiologist. He did some work with anthrax, and a lot of work with H.I.V., and he was also quite familiar with Ebola, smallpox, herpes and influenza. At 57, he was the father of four children and a professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the department of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard. On Nov. 15, four days before the attack on Benito Que, Wiley was in Memphis to visit his father and to attend the annual meeting of the scientific advisory board of St. Jude's Research Hospital, of which he was a member. At midnight, he was seen leaving a banquet at the Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis. Friends and colleagues say he had a little to drink but did not appear impaired, and they remember him as being in a fine mood, looking forward to seeing his wife and children, who were about to join him for a short vacation. Wiley's father lives in a Memphis suburb, and that is where Wiley should have been headed after the banquet. Instead, his car was found facing in the opposite direction on the Hernando DeSoto Bridge, which spans the Mississippi River at the border of Tennessee and Arkansas. When the police found the car at 4 a.m., it was unlocked, the keys were in the ignition and the gas tank was full. There was a scrape of yellow paint on the driver's side, which appeared to come from a construction sign on the bridge, and a right hubcap was missing on the passenger side, where the wheel rims were also scraped. There was no sign, however, of Don Wiley. The police trawled the muddy Mississippi, but they didn't really expect to find him. Currents run fast at that part of the river, and a body would be quickly swept away. At the start of the search, they thought he might have committed suicide; others had jumped from the DeSoto Bridge over the years. Detectives searched Wiley's financial records, his family relationships, his scientific research -- anything for a hint that the man might have had cause to take his own life. Finding nothing, the investigation turned medical. Wiley, they learned, had a seizure disorder that he had hidden from all but family and close friends. He had a history of two or three major episodes a year, his wife told investigators, and the condition was made worse when he was under stress or the influence of alcohol. Had Wiley, who could well have been tired, disoriented by bridge construction and under the influence of a few drinks, had a seizure that sent him over the side of the bridge? That was the theory the police spoke of in public, but they were also considering something else. The week that Wiley disappeared coincided with the peak of anthrax fear throughout the country. Tainted letters appeared the month before at the Senate and the House of Representatives. Two weeks earlier, a New York City hospital worker died of inhaled anthrax. Memphis was not untouched by the scare; a federal judge and two area congressmen each received hoax letters. Could it be mere chance that this particular scientist, who had profound knowledge of these microbes, had disappeared at this time? ''The circumstances were peculiar,'' says George Bolds, a spokesman for the Memphis bureau of the F.B.I., which was called in to assist. ''There were questions that had to be asked. Could he have been kidnapped because his scientific abilities would have made him capable of creating anthrax? Or maybe he'd had some involvement in the mailing of the anthrax, and he'd disappeared to cover his tracks? Did his co-conspirators grab him and kill him? ''We were in new territory,'' Bolds continued. ''Just because something is conceivable doesn't mean it's actually happened, but at the same time, just because it's never happened before doesn't mean it can't happen. People's ideas of what is possible definitely changed on Sept. 11. People feel less secure and less safe. I'm not sure that they're at greater risk than they were before. Maybe they're just more aware of the risk they are actually at.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   As a species, we appear to be biologically programmed to see patterns and conspiracies, and this tendency increases when we sense that we're in danger. ''We are hard-wired to overreact to coincidences,'' says Persi Diaconis. ''It goes back to primitive man. You look in the bush, it looks like stripes, you'd better get out of there before you determine the odds that you're looking at a tiger. The cost of being flattened by the tiger is high. Right now, people are noticing any kind of odd behavior and being nervous about it.'' Adds John Allen Paulos: ''Human beings are pattern-seeking animals. It might just be part of our biology that conspires to make coincidences more meaningful than they really are. Look at the natural world of rocks and plants and rivers: it doesn't offer much evidence for superfluous coincidences, but primitive man had to be alert to all anomalies and respond to them as if they were real.'' For decades, all academic talk of coincidence has been in the context of the mathematical. New work by scientists like Joshua B. Tenenbaum, an assistant professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences at M.I.T., is bringing coincidence into the realm of human cognition. Finding connections is not only the way we react to the extraordinary, Tenenbaum postulates, but also the way we make sense of our ordinary world. ''Coincidences are a window into how we learn about things,'' he says. ''They show us how minds derive richly textured knowledge from limited situations.'' To put it another way, our reaction to coincidence shows how our brains fill in the factual blanks. In an optical illusion, he explains, our brain fills the gaps, and although people take it for granted that seeing is believing, optical illusions prove that's not true. ''Illusions also prove that our brain is capable of imposing structure on the world,'' he says. ''One of the things our brain is designed to do is infer the causal structure of the world from limited information.'' If not for this ability, he says, a child could not learn to speak. A child sees a conspiracy, he says, in that others around him are obviously communicating and it is up to the child to decode the method. But these same mechanisms can misfire, he warns. They were well suited to a time of cavemen and tigers and can be overloaded in our highly complex world. ''It's why we have the urge to work everything into one big grand scheme,'' he says. ''We do like to weave things together. ''But have we evolved into fundamentally rational or fundamentally irrational creatures? That is one of the central questions.'' We pride ourselves on being independent and original, and yet our reactions to nearly everything can be plotted along a predictable spectrum. When the grid is coincidences, one end of the scale is for those who believe that these are entertaining events with no meaning; at the other end are those who believe that coincidence is never an accident. The view of coincidence as fate has lately become something of a minitrend in the New Age section of bookstores. Among the more popular authors is SQuire Rushnell (who, in the interest of marketing, spells his first name with a capital Q). Rushnell spent 20 years producing such television programs as ''Good Morning America'' and ''Schoolhouse Rock.'' His fascination with coincidence began when he learned that both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died on the same July 4, 50 years after the ratification of the Declaration of Independence.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''That stuck in my craw,'' Rushnell says, ''and I couldn't stop wondering what that means.'' And so Rushnell wrote ''When God Winks: How the Power of Coincidence Guides Your Life.'' The book was published by a small press shortly before Sept. 11 and sold well without much publicity. It will be rereleased with great fanfare by Simon & Schuster next month. Its message, Rushnell says, is that ''coincidences are signposts along your universal pathway. They are hints that you are going in the right direction or that you should change course. It's like your grandmother sitting across the Thanksgiving table from you and giving you a wink. What does that wink mean? 'I'm here, I love you, stay the course.'''  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      During my interview with Rushnell, I told him the following story: On a frigid December night many years ago, a friend dragged me out of my warm apartment, where I planned to spend the evening in my bathrobe nursing a cold. I had to come with her to the movies, she said, because she had made plans with a pal from her office, and he was bringing a friend for me to meet. Translation: I was expected to show up for a last-minute blind date. For some reason, I agreed to go, knocking back a decongestant as I left home. We arrived at the theater to find that the friend who was supposed to be my ''date'' had canceled, but not to worry, another friend had been corralled as a replacement. The replacement and I both fell asleep in the movie (I was sedated by cold medicine; he was a medical resident who had been awake for 36 hours), but four months later we were engaged, and we have been married for nearly 15 years. Rushnell was enthralled by this tale, particularly by the mystical force that seemed to have nudged me out the door when I really wanted to stay home and watch ''The Golden Girls.'' I know that those on the other end of the spectrum -- the scientists and mathematicians -- would have offered several overlapping explanations of why it was unremarkable. There are, of course, the laws of big numbers and small numbers -- the fact that the world is simultaneously so large that anything can happen and so small that weird things seem to happen all the time. Add to that the work of the late Amos Tversky, a giant in the field of coincidence theory, who once described his role in this world as ''debugging human intuition.'' Among other things, Tversky disproved the ''hot hand'' theory of basketball, the belief that a player who has made his last few baskets will more likely than not make his next. After examining thousands of shots by the Philadelphia 76ers, he proved that the odds of a successful shot cannot be predicted by the shots that came before. Tversky similarly proved that arthritis sufferers cannot actually predict the weather and are not in more pain when there's a storm brewing, a belief that began with the ancient Greeks. He followed 18 patients for 15 months, keeping detailed records of their reports of pain and joint swelling and matching them with constantly updated weather reports. There was no pattern, he concluded, though he also conceded that his data would not change many people's beliefs. We believe in such things as hot hands and arthritic forecasting and predestined blind dates because we notice only the winning streaks, only the chance meetings that lead to romance, only the days that Grandma's hands ache before it rains. ''We forget all the times that nothing happens,'' says Ruma Falk, a professor emeritus of psychology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, who studied years ago with Tversky. ''Dreams are another example,'' Falk says. ''We dream a lot. Every night and every morning. But it sometimes happens that the next day something reminds you of that dream. Then you think it was a premonition.'' Falk's work is focused on the question of why we are so entranced by coincidence in the first place. Her research itself began with a coincidence. She was on sabbatical in New York from her native Israel, and on the night before Rosh Hashana she happened to meet a friend from Jerusalem on a Manhattan street corner. She and the friend stood on that corner and marveled at the coincidence. What is the probability of this happening? she remembers wondering. What did this mean? ''How stupid we were,'' Falk says now, ''to be so surprised. We related to all the details that had converged to create that moment. But the real question was what was the probability that at some time in some place I would meet one of my circle of friends? And when I told this story to others at work, they encoded the events as two Israelis meeting in New York, something that happens all the time.'' Why was her experience so resonant for her, Falk asked herself, but not for those around her? One of the many experiments she has conducted since then proceeded as follows: she visited several large university classes, with a total of 200 students, and asked each student to write his or her birth date on a card. She then quietly sorted the cards and found the handful of birthdays that students had in common. Falk wrote those dates on the blackboard. April 10, for instance, Nov. 8, Dec. 16. She then handed out a second card and asked all the students to use a scale to rate how surprised they were by these coincidences.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The cards were numbered, so Falk could determine which answers came from respondents who found their own birth date written on the board. Those in that subgroup were consistently more surprised by the coincidence than the rest of the students. ''It shows the stupid power of personal involvement,'' Falk says. The more personal the event, the more meaning we give it, which is why I am quite taken with my story of meeting my husband (because it is a pivotal moment in my life), and why SQuire Rushnell is also taken with it (because it fits into the theme of his book), but also why Falk is not impressed at all. She likes her own story of the chance meeting on a corner better than my story, while I think her story is a yawn. The fact that personal attachment adds significance to an event is the reason we tend to react so strongly to the coincidences surrounding Sept. 11. In a deep and lasting way, that tragedy feels as if it happened to us all. Falk's findings also shed light on the countless times that pockets of the general public find themselves at odds with authorities and statisticians. Her results might explain, for instance, why lupus patients are certain their breast implants are the reason for their illness, despite the fact that epidemiologists conclude there is no link, or why parents of autistic children are resolute in their belief that childhood immunizations or environmental toxins or a host of other suspected pathogens are the cause, even though experts are skeptical. They might also explain the outrage of all the patients who are certain they live in a cancer cluster, but who have been told otherwise by researchers. Let's be clear: this does not mean that conspiracies do not sometimes exist or that the environment never causes clusters of death. And just as statistics are often used to show us that we should not be surprised, they can also prove what we suspect, that something is wrong out there. ''The fact that so many suspected cancer clusters have turned out to be statistically insupportable does not mean the energy we spent looking for them has been wasted,'' says Dr. James M. Robins, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Harvard and an expert on cancer clusters. ''You're never going to find the real ones if you don't look at all the ones that don't turn out to be real ones.'' Most often, though, coincidence is a sort of Rorschach test. We look into it and find what we already believe. ''It's like an archer shooting an arrow and then drawing a circle around it,'' Falk says. ''We give it meaning because it does mean something -- to us.'' Vladimir Pasechnik was 64 when he died. His early career was spent in the Soviet Union working at Biopreparat, the site of that country's biological weapons program. He defected in 1989 and spilled what he knew to the British, revealing for the first time the immense scale of Soviet work with anthrax, plague, tularemia and smallpox.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For the next 10 years, he worked at the Center for Applied Microbiology and Research, part of Britain's Department of Health. Two years ago, he left to form Regma Biotechnologies, whose goal was to develop treatment for tuberculosis and other infectious disease. In the weeks before he died, Pasechnik had reportedly consulted with authorities about the growing anthrax scare. Despite all these intriguing details, there is nothing to suggest that his death was caused by anything other than a stroke. Robert Schwartz's death, while far more dramatic and bizarre, also appears to have nothing to do with the fact that he was an expert on DNA sequencing and analysis. On Dec. 10 he was found dead on the kitchen floor of his isolated log-and-fieldstone farmhouse near Leesburg, Va., where he had lived alone since losing his wife to cancer four years ago and his children to college. Schwartz had been stabbed to death with a two-foot-long sword, and his killer had carved an X on the back of his neck. Three friends of Schwartz's college-age daughter were soon arrested for what the prosecutor called a ''planned assassination''; two of the trials for first-degree murder are scheduled for this month. A few weeks later, police arrested the daughter as well. One suspect has a history of mental illness, and their written statements to police talk of devil worship and revenge. There is no talk, however, of microbiology. On the same day that Schwartz died, Set Van Nguyen, 44, was found dead in an air-locked storage chamber at the Australian Commonwealth's Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's animal diseases facility in Geelong. A months-long internal investigation concluded that a string of equipment failures had allowed nitrogen to build up in the room, causing Nguyen to suffocate. Although the center itself dealt with microbes like mousepox, which is similar to smallpox, Nguyen himself did not. ''Nguyen was in no way involved in research into mousepox,'' says Stephen Prowse, who was the acting director of the Australian lab during the investigation. ''He was a valued member of the laboratory's technical support staff and not a research scientist.'' Word of all these deaths (though not the specific details) found its way to Ian Gurney, a British writer. Gurney is the author of ''The Cassandra Prophecy: Armageddon Approaches,'' a book that uses clues from the Bible to calculate that Judgment Day will occur in or about the year 2023. He is currently researching his second book, which is in part about the threat of nuclear and biological weapons, and after Sept. 11 he entered a news alert request into Yahoo, asking to be notified whenever there was news with the key word ''microbiologist.'' First Que, then Wiley, then Pasechnik, Schwartz and Nguyen popped up on Gurney's computer. ''I'm not a conspiracy theorist,'' says the man who has predicted the end of the world, ''but it certainly did look suspicious.'' Gurney compiled what he had learned from these scattered accounts into an article that he sent to a number of Web sites, including Rense.com, which tracks U.F.O. sightings worldwide. ''Over the past few weeks,'' Gurney wrote, ''several world-acclaimed scientific researchers specializing in infectious diseases and biological agents such as anthrax, as well as DNA sequencing, have been found dead or have gone missing.'' The article went on to call Benito Que, the cancer lab technician, ''a cell biologist working on infectious diseases like H.I.V.,'' and said that he had been attacked by four men with a baseball bat but did not mention that he suffered from high blood pressure. It then described the disappearance of Wiley without mentioning his seizure disorder and the death of Pasechnik without saying that he had suffered a stroke. It gave the grisly details of Schwartz's murder, but said nothing of the arrests of his daughter's friends. Nguyen, in turn, was described as ''a skilled microbiologist,'' and it was noted that he shared a last name with Kathy Nguyen, the 61-year-old hospital worker who just happened to be the one New Yorker to die of anthrax.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Of course, there have always been rumors based on skewed historical fact. Recall, for example, the list of coincidences that supposedly linked the deaths of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. It goes, in part, like this: The two men were elected 100 years apart; their assassins were born 100 years apart (in fact, 101 years apart); they were both succeeded by men named Johnson; and the two Johnsons were born 100 years apart. Their names each contain seven letters; their successors' names each contain 13 letters; and their assassins' names each contain 15 letters. Lincoln was shot in a theater and his assassin ran to a warehouse, while Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assassin ran to a theater. Lincoln, or so the story goes, had a secretary named Kennedy who warned him not to go to the theater the night he was killed (for the record, Lincoln's White House secretaries were named John Nicolay and John Hay, and Lincoln regularly rejected warnings not to attend public events out of fear for his safety, including his own inauguration); Kennedy, in turn, had a secretary named Lincoln (true, Evelyn Lincoln) who warned him not to go to Dallas (he, too, was regularly warned not to go places, including San Antonio the day before his trip to Dallas). I first read about these connections five years after the Kennedy assassination, when I was 8, which says something about how conspiracy theory speaks to the child in all of us. But it also says something about the technology of the time. The numerological coincidences from the World Trade Center that I mentioned at the start of this article made their way onto my computer screen by Sept. 15, from a friend of a friend of a friend of an acquaintance, ad infinitum and ad nauseam. Professor Robins of Harvard points out that ''the Web has changed the scale of these things.'' Had there been a string of dead scientists back in 1992 rather than 2002, he says, it is possible that no one would have ever known. ''Back then, you would not have had the technical ability to gather all these bits and pieces of information, while today you'd be able to pull it off. It's well known that if you take a lot of random noise, you can find chance patterns in it, and the Net makes it easier to collect random noise.'' The Gurney article traveled from one Web site to the next and caught the attention of Paul Sieveking, a co-editor of Fortean Times, a magazine that describes itself as ''the Journal of Strange Phenomena.'' ''People send me stuff all the time,'' Sieveking says. ''This was really interesting.'' Wearing his second hat as a columnist for the The Sunday Telegraph in London, he wrote a column on the subject for that paper titled ''Strange but True -- The Deadly Curse of the Bioresearchers.'' His version began with the link between the two Nguyens and concluded, ''It is possible that nothing connects this string of events, but . . . it offers ample fodder for the conspiracy theorist or thriller writer.'' Commenting on the story months later, Sieveking says: ''It's probably just a random clumping, but it just happens to look significant. We're all natural storytellers, and conspiracy theorists are just frustrated novelists. We like to make up a good story out of random facts.'' Over the months, Gurney added names to his list and continued to send it to virtual and actual publications around the U.S. Mainstream newspapers started taking up the story, including an alternative weekly in Memphis, where interest in the Wiley case was particularly strong, and most recently The Toronto Globe and Mail. The tally of ''microbiologists'' is now at 11, give or take, depending on the story you read. In addition to the men already discussed, the names that appear most often are these: Victor Korshunov, a Russian expert in intestinal bacteria, who was bashed over the head near his home in Moscow; Ian Langford, a British expert in environmental risk and disease, who was found dead in his home near Norwich, England, naked from the waist down and wedged under a chair; Tanya Holzmayer, who worked as a microbiologist near San Jose and was shot seven times by a former colleague when she opened the door to a pizza delivery man; David Wynn-Williams, who studied microbes in the Antarctic and was hit by a car while jogging near his home in Cambridge, England; and Steven Mostow, an expert in influenza, who died when the plane he was piloting crashed near Denver. The stories have also made their way into the e-mail in-boxes of countless microbiologists. Janet Shoemaker, director of public and scientific affairs for the American Society for Microbiology, heard the tales and points out that her organization alone has 41,000 members, meaning that the deaths of 11 worldwide, most of whom were not technically microbiologists at all, is not statistically surprising. ''We're saddened by anyone's death,'' she says. ''But this is just a coincidence. In another political climate I don't think anyone would have noticed.''

He was the No. 2 man at Biopreparrat (where Victor Pasechnik also worked) before he defected and now works with the U.S. government seeking antidotes for the very weapons he developed. Those who have died, he says, did not really know anything about biological weapons, and if there were a conspiracy to kill scientists with such knowledge, he would be dead. ''I considered all this a little artificial, because a number of them couldn't have been considered B.W. experts,'' he says with a hint of disdain. ''I got an e-mail from Pasechnik before he died, and he was working on a field completely different from this. People say to me, 'Ken, you could be a target,' but if you start thinking about this, then your life is over. I'm not saying I'm not worried, but I'm not paying much attention. I'm opening my mail as usual. If I see something suspicious, I know what to do.'' Others are not quite as sanguine. Phyllis Della-Latta is the director of clinical microbiology services at New York's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. She found an article on the deaths circulating in the most erudite place -- an Internet discussion group of directors of clinical microbiology labs around the world. These are the people who, when a patient develops suspicious symptoms, are brought in to rule out things like anthrax. Della-Latta, whom I know from past medical reporting, forwarded the article to me with a note: ''See attached. FYI. Should I be concerned??? I'm off on a business trip to Italy tomorrow & next week. If I don't return, write my obituary.'' She now says she doesn't really believe there is any connection between the deaths. ''It's probably only coincidence,'' she says, then adds: ''But if we traced back a lot of things that we once dismissed as coincidence -- foreigners taking flying lessons -- we would have found they weren't coincidence at all. You become paranoid. You have to be.'' Don Wiley's body was finally found on Dec. 20, near Vidalia, La., about 300 miles south of where he disappeared. The Memphis medical examiner, O.C. Smith, concluded that yellow paint marks on Wiley's car suggest that he hit a construction sign on the Hernando DeSoto Bridge, as does the fact that a hubcap was missing from the right front tire. Smith's theory is that heavy truck traffic on the bridge can set off wind gusts and create ''roadway bounce,'' which might have been enough to cause Wiley to lose his balance after getting out of the car to inspect the scrapes. He was 6-foot-3, and the bridge railing would have only come up to mid-thigh. ''If Dr. Wiley were on the curb trying to assess damage to his car, all of these factors may have played a role in his going over the rail,'' Smith said when he issued his report. Bone fractures found on the body support this theory. Wiley suffered fractures to his neck and spine, and his chest was crushed, injuries that are consistent with Wiley's hitting a support beam before he landed in the water. The Wiley family considers this case closed. ''These kinds of theories are something that's always there,'' says Wiley's wife, Katrin Valgeirsdottir, who has heard all the rumors. ''People who want to believe it will believe it, and there's nothing anyone can say.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Memphis Police also consider the case closed, and the local office of the F.B.I. has turned its attention to other odd happenings. The talk of Memphis at the moment is the bizarre ambush of the city's coroner last month. He was wrapped in barbed wire and left lying in a stairwell of the medical examiner's building with a live bomb strapped to his chest. Coincidentally, that coroner, O.C. Smith, was also the coroner who did the much-awaited, somewhat controversial autopsy on Don Wiley. What are the odds of that? The numbers 9/11 (9 plus 1 plus 1) equal 11, and American Airlines Flight 11 was the first to hit the twin towers, and there were 92 people on board (9 plus 2), and Sept. 11 is the 254th day of the year (2 plus 5 plus 4).; What of the deaths of nearly a dozen scientists? Is it really possible that they all just happened to die, most in such jarring ways, within so short a time?; The fact that personal attachment adds significance to an event is the reason we tend to react so strongly to the coincidences surrounding Sept. 11. In a deep and lasting way, that tragedy feels as if it happened to us all.; Presidents Kennedy and Lincoln were elected 100 years apart. Both men were succeeded by Johnsons, who were also born 100 years apart. Their names each contain seven letters. Their successors' names each contain 13 letters. Their assassins's names each contain 15 letters.; In a room of 23 people, the odds are even that two of them will have the same birthday. Reduce the occupants to 14, and it's even money that two of them were born within one day of each other. And for a 50-50 chance of finding a pair with birthdays a week apart, you need to invite only seven to the party.   Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer for the magazine.

(March 2016)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Odds are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics . In statistics, the odds for or odds of some event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while odds against reflect the likelihood that it will not. In gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event. [1] [2] Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event.  In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. [3] Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker ) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. In simplest terms, 6 to 1 odds means if you bet a dollar (the "1" in the expression), and you win you get paid six dollars (the "6" in the expression), or 6 x 1. If you bet two dollars you would be paid twelve dollars, or 6 x 2. If you bet three dollars and win, you would be paid eighteen dollars, or 6 x 3. If you bet one hundred dollars and win you would be paid six hundred dollars, or 6 x 100. If you lose any of those bets you would lose the dollar, or two dollars, or three dollars, or one hundred dollars.  In statistics, the odds for an event E are defined as a simple function of the probability of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the uncertainty of this possible event as odds for is that to regain the probability requires a calculation. The natural way to interpret odds for (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) odds for rolling six with a fair die (one of a pair of dice ) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 six event for every 5 times the die does not show six. For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 sixes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) odds against, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the odds against rolling a six with a fair die are 5 to 1. The probability of rolling a six with a fair die is the single number 1/6, roughly 0.17.  The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a six will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a six and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a six, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a six and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no advantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. Casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the United States. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.

[4] Shakespeare wrote:   Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one  — William Shakespeare , Henry IV, Part II , Act I, Scene 1 lines 181–2.   The sixteenth century polymath Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes [5] ).  Terminology [ edit ]  Odds are expressed in the form X to Y, where X and Y are numbers. Usually, the word "to" is replaced by a symbol for ease of use. This is conventionally either a slash or hyphen , although a colon is sometimes seen. Thus, 6/1, 6-1 and 6:1 are all interchangeable.  Odds against [ edit ]  When the probability that the event will not happen is greater than the probability that it will, then the odds are "against" that event happening. Odds of 6 to 1, for example, are therefore sometimes said to be "6 to 1 against ". To a gambler, "odds against" means that the amount he or she will win is greater than the amount staked.  Odds on [ edit ]  "Odds on" is the opposite of "odds against". It means that the event is more likely to happen than not. This is sometimes expressed with the smaller number first (1 to 2) but more often using the word "on" ("2 to 1 on ") meaning that the event is twice as likely to happen as not. Note that the gambler who bets at "odds on" and wins will still be in profit, as his stake will be returned. For example, on a $2 bet, the gambler will be given $1 plus the returned stake of $2, yielding a $1 profit.  Even odds [ edit ]  Main article: Even money  "Even odds" occur when the probability of an event happening is exactly the same as it not happening. In common parlance, this is a "50-50 chance". Guessing heads or tails on a coin toss is the classic example of an event that has even odds. In gambling, it is commonly referred to as " even money " or simply "evens" (1 to 1, or 2 for 1). "Evens" implies that the payout will be one unit per unit wagered plus the original stake, that is, "double-your-money".  Better than/worse than evens [ edit ]  The term "better than evens" (or "worse than evens") varies in meaning depending on context. Looked at from the perspective of a gambler rather than a statistician, "better than evens" means "odds against". If the odds are evens (1:1), and one bets 10 units, one would be returned 20 units, making a profit of 10 units. If the gamble was paying 4:1 and the event occurred, one would make 50 units, or a profit of 40 units. So, it is "better than evens" from the gambler's perspective because it pays out more than one-for-one. If an event is more likely to occur than an even chance, then the odds will be "worse than evens", and the bookmaker will pay out less than one-for-one.  However, in popular parlance surrounding uncertain events, the expression "better than evens" usually implies a greater than 50% chance of the event occurring, which is exactly the opposite of the meaning of the expression when used in a gaming context.  Statistical usage [ edit ]  In statistics, odds are an expression of relative probabilities, generally quoted as the odds in favor . The odds (in favor) of an event or a proposition is the ratio of the probability that the event will happen to the probability that the event will not happen. Mathematically, this is a Bernoulli trial , as it has exactly two outcomes. In case of a finite sample space of equally likely outcomes , this is the ratio of the number of outcomes where the event occurs to the number of outcomes where the event does not occur; these can be represented as W and L (for Wins and Losses) or S and F (for Success and Failure). For example, the odds that a randomly chosen day of the week is a weekend are two to five (2:5), as days of the week form a sample space of seven outcomes, and the event occurs for two of the outcomes (Saturday and Sunday), and not for the other five. [6] [7] Conversely, given odds as a ratio of integers, this can be represented by a probability space of a finite number of equally likely outcomes. These definitions are equivalent, since dividing both terms in the ratio by the number of outcomes yields the probabilities:     2  :  5  =  (  2   /   7  )  :  (  5   /   7  )  .    {\displaystyle 2:5=(2/7):(5/7).}   Conversely, the odds against is the opposite ratio. For example, the odds against a random day of the week being a weekend are 5:2.  Odds and probability can be expressed in prose via the prepositions to and in: "odds of so many to so many on (or against) [some event]" refers to odds – the ratio of numbers of (equally likely) outcomes in favor and against (or vice versa); "chances of so many [outcomes], in so many [outcomes]" refers to probability – the number of (equally like) outcomes in favour relative to the number for and against combined. For example, "odds of a weekend are 2 to 5", while "chances of a weekend are 2 in 7". In casual use, the words odds and chances (or chance ) are often used interchangeably to vaguely indicate some measure of odds or probability, though the intended meaning can be deduced by noting whether the preposition between the two numbers is to or in . [8] [9] [10]  Mathematical relations [ edit ]  Odds can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, in which case it is not unique – scaling both terms by the same factor does not change the proportions: 1:1 odds and 100:100 odds are the same (even odds). Odds can also be expressed as a number, by dividing the terms in the ratio – in this case it is unique (different fractions can represent the same rational number ). Odds as a ratio, odds as a number, and probability (also a number) are related by simple formulas, and similarly odds in favor and odds against, and probability of success and probability of failure have simple relations. Odds range from 0 to infinity, while probabilities range from 0 to 1, and hence are often represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%: reversing the ratio switches odds for with odds against, and similarly probability of success with probability of failure.  Given odds (in favor) as the ratio W:L (Wins:Losses), the odds in favor (as a number)      o   f      {\displaystyle o_{f}}   and odds against (as a number)      o   a      {\displaystyle o_{a}}   can be computed by simply dividing, and are multiplicative inverses :            o   f       =  W   /   L  =  1   /    o   a         o   a       =  L   /   W  =  1   /    o   f         o   f    ⋅   o   a       =  1        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}o_{f}&=W/L=1/o_{a}\\o_{a}&=L/W=1/o_{f}\\o_{f}\cdot o_{a}&=1\end{aligned}}}     Analogously, given odds as a ratio, the probability of success or failure can be computed by dividing, and the probability of success and probability of failure sum to unity (one), as they are the only possible outcomes. In case of a finite number of equally likely outcomes, this can be interpreted as the number of outcomes where the event occurs divided by the total number of events:           p     =  W   /   (  W  +  L  )  =  1  −  q      q     =  L   /   (  W  +  L  )  =  1  −  p      p  +  q     =  1        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=W/(W+L)=1-q\\q&=L/(W+L)=1-p\\p+q&=1\end{aligned}}}     Given a probability p, the odds as a ratio is     p  :  q    {\displaystyle p:q}   (probability of success to probability of failure), and the odds as numbers can be computed by dividing:            o   f       =  p   /   q  =  p   /   (  1  −  p  )  =  (  1  −  q  )   /   q       o   a       =  q   /   p  =  (  1  −  p  )   /   p  =  q   /   (  1  −  q  )        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}o_{f}&=p/q=p/(1-p)=(1-q)/q\\o_{a}&=q/p=(1-p)/p=q/(1-q)\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, given the odds as a number      o   f    ,    {\displaystyle o_{f},}   this can be represented as the ratio      o   f    :  1  ,    {\displaystyle o_{f}:1,}   or conversely     1  :  (  1   /    o   f    )  =  1  :   o   a    ,    {\displaystyle 1:(1/o_{f})=1:o_{a},}   from which the probability of success or failure can be computed:           p     =   o   f     /   (   o   f    +  1  )  =  1   /   (   o   a    +  1  )      q     =   o   a     /   (   o   a    +  1  )  =  1   /   (   o   f    +  1  )        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=o_{f}/(o_{f}+1)=1/(o_{a}+1)\\q&=o_{a}/(o_{a}+1)=1/(o_{f}+1)\end{aligned}}}     Thus if expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1, probability and odds differ by exactly 1 in the denominator: a probability of 1 in 100 (1/100 = 1%) is the same as odds of 1 to 99 (1/99 = 0.0101… = 0. 01 ), while odds of 1 to 100 (1/100 = 0.01) is the same as a probability of 1 in 101 (1/101 = 0.00990099… = 0. 0099 ). This is a minor difference if the probability is small (close to zero, or "long odds"), but is a major difference if the probability is large (close to one).  These are worked out for some simple odds:    odds (ratio)       o   f      {\displaystyle o_{f}}         o   a      {\displaystyle o_{a}}        p    {\displaystyle p}        q    {\displaystyle q}      1:1  1  1  50%  50%    0:1  0  ∞  0%  100%    1:0  ∞  0  100%  0%    2:1  2  0.5  67%  33%    1:2  0.5  2  33%  67%    4:1  4  0.25  80%  20%    1:4  0.25  4  20%  80%       9:1  9  0. 1  90%  10%    10:1  10  0.1  90. 90 %  9. 09 %    99:1  99  0. 01  99%  1%    100:1  100  0.01  99. 0099 %  0. 90 %    These transforms have certain special geometric properties: the conversions between odds for and odds against (resp. probability of success with probability of failure) and between odds and probability are all Möbius transformations (fractional linear transformations). They are thus specified by three points ( sharply 3-transitive ). Swapping odds for and odds against swaps 0 and infinity, fixing 1, while swapping probability of success with probability of failure swaps 0 and 1, fixing .5; these are both order 2, hence circular transforms . Converting odds to probability fixes 0, sends infinity to 1, and sends 1 to .5 (even odds are 50% likely), and conversely; this is a parabolic transform .  Applications [ edit ]  In probability theory and Bayesian statistics , odds may sometimes be more natural or more convenient than probabilities. This is often the case in problems of sequential decision making as for instance in problems of how to stop (online) on a last specific event which is solved by the odds algorithm . Similar ratios are used elsewhere in Bayesian statistics, such as the Bayes factor .  The odds are a ratio of probabilities; an odds ratio is a ratio of odds, that is, a ratio of ratios of probabilities. Odds-ratios are often used in analysis of clinical trials . While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter- intuitive results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is four times more likely to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the odds are 16 times higher on the less likely event (4–1 against , or 4) than on the more likely one (1–4, or 4–1 on , or 0.25).  In some cases the log-odds are used, which is the logit of the probability. Most simply, odds are frequently multiplied or divided, and log converts multiplication to addition and division to subtractions.   Example #1  There are 5 pink marbles, 2 blue marbles, and 8 purple marbles. What are the odds in favor of picking a blue marble?   Answer: The odds in favour of a blue marble are 2:13. One can equivalently say, that the odds are 13:2 against . There are 2 out of 15 chances in favour of blue, 13 out of 15 against blue.  In probability theory and statistics , where the variable p is the probability in favor of a binary event, and the probability against the event is therefore 1- p , "the odds" of the event are the quotient of the two, or       p   1  −  p       {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{1-p}}}   . That value may be regarded as the relative probability the event will happen, expressed as a fraction (if it is less than 1), or a multiple (if it is equal to or greater than one) of the likelihood that the event will not happen.  In the very first example at top, saying the odds of a Sunday are "one to six" or, less commonly, "one-sixth" means the probability of picking a Sunday randomly is one-sixth the probability of not picking a Sunday. While the mathematical probability of an event has a value in the range from zero to one, "the odds" in favor of that same event lie between zero and infinity. The odds against the event with probability given as p are        1  −  p   p      {\displaystyle {\frac {1-p}{p}}}   . The odds against Sunday are 6:1 or  6/1 = 6. It is 6 times as likely that a random day is not a Sunday.   Example #2  There are 5 red marbles, 2 green marbles, and 8 yellow marbles. What are the odds against picking a yellow marble?   Answer: 7:8  Gambling usage [ edit ]  The use of odds in gambling facilitates betting on events where the relative probabilities of outcomes varied. For example, on a coin toss or a match race between two evenly matched horses, it is reasonable for two people to wager level stakes. However, in more variable situations, such as a multi-runner horse race or a football match between two unequally matched sides, betting "at odds" provides a perspective on the relative likelihoods of the possible outcomes.  In the modern era, most fixed odds betting takes place between a betting organisation, such as a bookmaker , and an individual, rather than between individuals. Different traditions have grown up in how to express odds to customers, older eras came with betting odds between people, today which is illegal in most countries, it was referred as "odding", an underground slang word with origins based in the Bronx.  Fractional odds [ edit ]  Favoured by bookmakers in the United Kingdom and Ireland , and also common in horse racing , fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the bettor, should he or she win, relative to the stake. [11] Odds of 4/1 would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake. If the odds are 1/4, the bettor will make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, having won, the bettor always receives the original stake back; so if the odds are 4/1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as evens or even money .  The numerator and denominator of fractional odds are always integers , thus if the bookmaker's payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator . For example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.  Fractional odds are also known as British odds,  UK odds, [12] or, in that country, traditional odds . They are typically represented with a "/" but can also be represented with a "-", e.g. 4/1 or 4-1. Odds with a denominator of 1 are often presented in listings as the numerator only. [ citation needed ]  A variation of fractional odds is known as Hong Kong odds. Fractional and Hong Kong odds are actually exchangeable. The only difference is that the UK odds are presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong odds are decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.  The European odds also represent the potential winnings (net returns), but in addition they factor in the stake (e.g. 6/5 or 1.2 plus 1 = 2.2). [13]  Decimal odds [ edit ]  Favoured in continental Europe , Australia , New Zealand and Canada , decimal odds quote the ratio of the payout amount, including the original stake, to the stake itself. [14] Decimal odds are generally considered the easiest to deal with as they reflect the inverse of the probability of an outcome. [15] Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one. [16] Thus even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2.00. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5.00, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. This is considered to be ideal for parlay betting, because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on. Decimal odds are also favoured by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading.  Decimal odds are also known as European odds , digital odds or continental odds. [12]  Moneyline odds [ edit ]  Main article: moneyline odds  Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. The figure quoted is either positive or negative.   When moneyline odds are positive, the figure indicates how much money will be won on a $100 wager (this is done for an outcome that is considered less likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 4/1 would be quoted as +400.  When moneyline odds are negative, the figure indicates how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done for an outcome is considered more likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 1/4 would be quoted as -400.   Moneyline odds are often referred to as American odds . A "Moneyline" wager refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread . In most cases, the favorite will have negative moneyline odds (less payoff for a safer bet) and the underdog will have positive moneyline odds (more payoff for a risky bet). However, if the teams are evenly matched, both teams can have a negative line at the same time (e.g. -110 -110 or -105 -115), due to house take.  Gambling odds versus probabilities [ edit ]  Main article: Mathematics of bookmaking  In gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the bookmaker will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. In formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful bettor is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. This profit is known as the 'over-round' on the 'book' (the 'book' refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term 'bookmaker') and relates to the sum of the 'odds' in the following way:  In a 3-horse race, for example, the true probabilities of each of the horses winning based on their relative abilities may be 50%, 40% and 10%. The total of these three percentages is 100%, thus representing a fair 'book'. The true odds against winning for each of the three horses are 1-1, 3-2 and 9-1 respectively.  In order to generate a profit on the wagers accepted, the bookmaker may decide to increase the values to 60%, 50% and 20% for the three horses, respectively. This represents the odds against each, which are 4-6, 1-1 and 4-1, in order. These values now total 130%, meaning that the book has an overround of 30 (130−100). This value of 30 represents the amount of profit for the bookmaker if he gets bets in good proportions on each of the horses. For example, if he takes £60, £50, and £20 of stakes respectively for the three horses, he receives £130 in wagers but only pays £100 back (including stakes), whichever horse wins. And the expected value of his profit is positive even if everybody bets on the same horse. The art of bookmaking is in setting the odds low enough so as to have a positive expected value of profit while keeping the odds high enough to attract customers, and at the same time attracting enough bets for each outcome to reduce his risk exposure.  A study on soccer betting found that the probability for the home team to win was generally about 3.4% less than the value calculated from the odds (for example, 46.6% for even odds). It was about 3.7% less for wins by the visitors, and 5.7% less for draws. [17]  Making a profit in gambling involves predicting the relationship of the true probabilities to the payout odds. Sports information services are often used by professional and semi-professional sports bettors to help achieve this goal.  The odds or amounts the bookmaker will pay are determined by the total amount that has been bet on all of the possible events. They reflect the balance of wagers on either side of the event, and include the deduction of a bookmaker's brokerage fee ("vig" or vigorish ).  Also, depending on how the betting is affected by jurisdiction, taxes may be involved for the bookmaker and/or the winning player. This may be taken into account when offering the odds and/or may reduce the amount won by a player.

If you flip a coin, the odds are 50-50 you'll get heads.   When we talk about odds, we're talking about probabilities, specifically, how likely it is that something will happen. Is there a 5% chance? Is there a 95% chance? If there's a 95% chance, then the odds are great. We can talk about the odds of anything happening, as long as it hasn't happened yet. Anyone predicting the weather is telling the odds of rain or snow â€” they don't know for sure. If something strange happens people often say, "What were the odds of that?", which means: "I can't believe that happened. The odds were against it."

For the concept of odd and even in mathematics, see Parity (mathematics) .  For the 1978 film, see Odds and Evens (film) .     Three rounds of the game, showing two, three and four fingers.    Odds and evens , also known as swords , choosies , pick , odds-on poke , or bucking up , is a hand game played between two people, [1] used to decide an issue. This zero-sum game , a variation of the ancient Morra and par-impar , [2] is played internationally, especially among children.  The individuals prepare by deciding who will be assigned odds and who will be evens. Then, one or both people say "One, two, three, shoot!!" or "one, strikes, three, shoot!" [3] As the word "shoot" is said, the two people quickly and simultaneously thrust a fist into the center, extending either an index finger, or both the middle and index finger, indicating one or two . The sum total of fingers displayed is either odd or even. If the result is odd, then the person who called odds is the victor, and can decide the issue as he or she sees fit. [4] [5] [6] Often, the participants continue to shoot for a best two out of three . [7]  From a game-theoretic perspective, the game is equivalent to Matching pennies . See that article for analysis of the strategies and chances of winning.  See also [ edit ]   Chetno i likho – a game of chance where the players have to guess if the hidden objects are even or odd.  Coin flipping – a method of making a yes-or-no decision at random.  Drawing straws – a method of making a group decision - choosing one member of the group.  Matching pennies – a game of chance with a similar strategic structure, using coins instead of fingers.  Parity game – an unrelated (and much more complicated) two-player logic game, played on a colored graph.  Rock-paper-scissors – a game where each player has three alternatives instead of two.

Ask New Question   Aseem Luthra , Technical Consultant  at KPMG Global Services Answered Oct 8, 2017 The term “What are the odds” is used to indicate chances of a particular event happening. Take this for example. There are two friends Mr X and Mr Y. Both of them go to a pub and Mr X gives Mr Y a dare, saying “You will have to click a selfie with 10 unknown strangers tonight”. Assuming that Mr Y takes on this dare, in this case odds is nothing but the probability of Mr Y successfully doing this dare. So if we say 1 in 10, it means that there is a chance that he will be able to get clicked once every 10 attempts. If it is 1 in 100, it means that he has a probability of getting clicked once in 100 chances. Important thing to note is that the probability will be described in terms of odd numbers, like 3 in 12, 7 in 30, 11 in 50. 4.1k Views promoted  by Grammarly Write with confidence.

Answered May 18, 2016 Well, well I would say that the word " today ", which you have used to describe time, is very vague because tomorrow will always eventually become Today , It usually takes around 24 hours only. Anyways, relative to time and your current existence , I would say there is a 100% inevitability that you will die Today! Yes, you read it right! Technically, when you will die, it will be TODAY to you. Moreover, maybe Today is Everyday until you reach your LAST TODAY, at which point you cease to exist on that day, which will be TODAY ! If that makes sense to you, I’m sorry! __________________________x_________________________ Apart from this philosophy, there are many factors that contribute to the stated scenario i.e. you dieing today such as if you have a chronic disease/illness or if you are a chain smoker, maybe the murder rate in your area or your mental health, how active you are physically. If that makes sense to you then go on and check out the website called Calculate your Ubble age .

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Probability and Gambling  Sports Betting  Betting  Gambling Betting: If someone says they'll give me 3:1 odds on the occurrence of an event, what does it mean? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 15 Answers   Simon Brown , former Seo Answered Apr 13, 2017 Odds are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics. In statistics, the odds for or odds of some event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while odds against reflect the likelihood that it will not. In gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event. Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event. In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. In statistics, the odds for an event E are defined as a simple function of the probability of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the uncertainty of this possible event as odds for is that to regain the probability requires a calculation. The natural way to interpret odds for (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) odds for rolling six with a fair die (one of a pair of dice) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 six event for every 5 times the die does not show six. For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 sixes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) odds against, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the odds against rolling a six with a fair die are 5 to 1. The probability of rolling a six with a fair die is the single number 1/6, roughly 0.17. The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a six will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a six and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a six, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a six and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no disadvantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. Casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the United States. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.

If a team has X:1 odds of covering the spread, what does that mean? Ask New Question   Peter Hand Answered Jan 14, 2016 · Author has 6.2k answers and 11.4m answer views " Odds on " means the event is more likely to happen than not, so for every $3 you bet, you win only $1 . If you were offered "odds against", then for every $1 you bet you would win $3. With odds on, it's as if the bookie is making the bet and you're paying him off, although you pay him off first and if he loses he gives you his stake. People are pretty casual with words these days so if someone says they'll give you 3:1 odds on something they probably mean odds against. But words do have a meaning, and that meaning can cost you money. So if it's a horse you're betting on or a professional gambler you're talking to, you should make sure you understand exactly what you're doing first. 38.4k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?   Andrew Brocker , Sports betting analyst, trader, writer Answered Jan 28, 2015 Betting odds can be presented in a number of different formats.  In this case, they are using what are known as Fractional Odds. So 3:1 means that if your bet wins, they will give you 3 for every 1 that you bet. So let's say you want to be $10, it means you will win 3 times this if your bet wins. In this case $30. In terms of analysis, the first thing you need to do is determine if the chances of the outcome occurring is greater than the probability represented in those odds. So what is the probability of the odds 3:1? We calculate this in the following way: We divide the denominator (in this case, 1) by the numerator + denominator (in this case 3+1), which gives us a probability of 25%. If you think the occurrence of the event is greater than 25%, then you should make the bet. If not, then no.

Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?   David Ramsey , Former pro poker player Answered Oct 19, 2017 · Author has 1.1k answers and 412.8k answer views A2A “Betting: If someone says they’ll give me 3:1 odds on the occurrence of an event, what does it mean? Also, what approach should we use on our analysis on whether to take the bet or not?” Let’s say the amount you bet is $100. If someone gives you 3:1 odds on that bet, that means that if you win, you’ll receive $300. In terms of how to know whether or not to take the bet, the implication of a bet where 3:1 odds are given is that the event has a 75% chance to go the odds-givers way, and a 25% chance to go your way. If you believe that this event will go your way more than 25% of the time, you should take the bet. If you believe that this event will go your way less than 25% of the time, you should not take it. 832 Views · Answer requested by  Bryan Frizzelle   Anup U Jamsandekar , good at finding possibilities Answered Jul 5, 2016 · Author has 136 answers and 100.5k answer views The traditional way of representing fixed odds are fractions. If some says you get 3:1 odds that means you if you bet 1$ with him he will give you 3$ in return plus your original 1$. So you secure initial bet money that is 1$ and you earn 3$ as a profit. You can also have odds in decimal format. Decimal format is pretty simple way in which you can calculate your profit and investment. Simple Maths! For Example: click here and you will see the market for US Presidential Election 2016 Winner. here the for Hillary Clinton to become next president is 1.25 (this is decimal odd), so if you bet 1$ you get back 1.25$ That’s all how odds work. 4.8k Views · View Upvoters   Craig Hubley , policy analyst, risk assessor, systems integrator Answered Jul 2, 2015 · Author has 456 answers and 252.1k answer views "3:1" or "3 to 1" means that the payoff is 3/1 (or "three times") the original bet, if it succeeds.  Such a payoff reflects the bookmaker's (or counterparty's) belief that the odds of success are less than 1 in 4 (4=1+3) or less than 25%. So, if the bookmaker believes an event is 22% likely, and offers 3 to 1 odds "against it", they expect to pay out 22% of bets but collect 25% of the total of all bets, for a 3% of all bets profit.  If the number of betters is indeed 3 to 1. If the amount gambled by betters begins to get much higher than say 27% or 30% of the total betters, then the bookmaker will very likely revisit the odds, assuming (usually correctly) that the "wisdom of the crowd" is more accurate than their own assumptions, and adjust the odds.  Perhaps to 2 to 1 (a 33% chance of success in the bookmaker's opinion). Depending on the type of gambling, all bets may be adjusted to the new odds, or the earlier bets may stand with the payoff when they were made. 7.6k Views · View Upvoters   Craig Berger , Screenwriter Answered May 15, 2016 · Author has 461 answers and 417.1k answer views If you’re getting 3:1, or 3 to 1, it means for every dollar you wager, you can win 3. So if you bet $10 and lose, you lose $10, but if you win, you win $30. As someone else has explained, this is an expression of someone’s impression of the probability of an event. If someone is offering you 3 to 1, it means they believe that the even you’re betting on will occur less than one time out of every four (or one time for every three that the event doesn’t occur). If you believe the event will occur more than 1 time for every 3 times it doesn’t, you should take the bet. Be sure you know the difference between 3 to 1 and 3 FOR 1. If you’re getting 3 FOR 1 you lose your bet no matter what, so if you bet $10 and win, you still win $30, but that includes the money you have already bet, so you’re really only winning$20. So 3 FOR 1 is actually 2 TO 1. 6.7k Views · View Upvoters   Jerry Katz , studied at B.S.

That would clarify it. 3:1 can be a good bet or a bad bet. For example, if a person says they will give you 3:1 that the world will not end today; that would be a bad bet. If a person would give you 3:1 odds that you can't guess whether a coin will come up heads or tails when flipped and lands on the ground' that would be a good bet for you, as long as you use your own coin.

In this particular case the odds of the event are useless to decide whether you should take the bet or not (all they determine is your greed); you should find and structure data that can help you determine the probability of winning the bet (there are different variables depending on the event). For example, if it was a football match you would take into account individual player stats, previous matches performance, any changes in the team, morale (if possible, although usually it's nearly impossible to determine this factor), weather, field, etc... If you gave more information I'd give you a more specific answer as to which variables to take into account when making the analysis, but as of now, that's the most complete answer I can give you. 9k Views · View Upvoters   Deepak Kumar , 10 Year Experience in Gambling and Sports Betting Answered Jun 6, 2016 · Author has 202 answers and 117.1k answer views That Was Very simple to predict the Odds of the Betting site Like if they offered you 3:1 Odds on the Occurrence of the Event that means if you should Place a Bet on Odds of 3,000 and if you won they will Return 4,000.

Then if it does rain today, you will win $400 (your original $100 + $300). If it does not rain, you will lose your $100 stake. Decimal odds are usually more straightforward, but some countries are more familiar with fractional odds. The simple rule of converting fractional odds to decimal odds is to simply divide the odds and add 1 to the answer.

God definitely exists. Research on people who experience d death have one thing in common.They see a light. They were able to see their body, they didn't feel pain. God is one. He is the father of all souls (we are brothers) in the world, Supreme soul (point of light present in soul/Silence world - Golden reddish region above universe). Souls are immortal comes down to earth to play its role in drama cycle. Soul a tiny star, present in the center of the forehead can experience a connection with the Supreme Soul by thoughts(meditation -a way to remove sin). Golden Age (Satyuga-Heaven1) Only 900000 souls to start with. All are Soul Consciousness & happy, have the Power to adjust, tolerate, discriminate, judge, face, Pack-up, Withdraw, Co-operate. Everything (house, dress, flights, roads etc) is made up of gold here. No lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego. Child were born through transfer of soul power. No God,No prayr. Silver Age (ThrethaYuga-Heaven2) It is similar to Golden age, but gold is replaced by Silver. The people who lived in Golden age and Silver age are called Deities.People are worshipping them, but they are also living among them after rebirth.Also weather is not too cold or hot. Heaven (1 Kingdom, 1 religion, 1 language, Max population : 330000000) is the Gods gift to good souls . Copper Age (DwabaraYyuga) & IRON Age (KaliYuga) - Hell : Soul conscious to body conscious. Peoples sin (actions out of lust, Anger,greed, attachment,ego etc) converts heaven to hell, The soul loses its purity and experience sorrow.The peoples from heaven also take part after rebirth(angel form for few days after death to human status based on karma). Many languages, Many religions. God comes to earth in old body and makes (3300 million) people worthy to live in heaven through spritual knowledge (remaining souls will be resting in soul world, will play its part at allotted time and also powerful in first few births) .End of world through destuction through nature/human actions(only small group remain every 5000 yrs) - All souls go back to soul world and the same drama repeats again.

If I'm not much mistaken, there are around 5,000 gods being worshipped today, which would put the existence of the Abrahamic deity at 5,000 to one against. But then, as we know, gods are prone to testing their subjects, so it could be that there's one true god, who resembles not of the currently worshipped gods, arms crossed, scowling, tapping its celestial toe, just waiting for us to come back to it, in which case, it could be any god from history, which pushes the odds way above ten thousand to one, not including all the spirits and deities lost to the mists of time.  And the end of the day, if you can't be sure of any gods existence, the idea in settling on one and hoping you got it right first time, seems a little short sighted. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters   Mar Moo Answered Feb 9, 2018 · Author has 631 answers and 52.7k answer views Q: What are the odds of God's existence?

Answered Sep 23, 2015 To calculate the odd of God existence we need: 1) A working definition of God. 2) A way to test the probability of the existence of God as defined in 1). (Logic or empirical experimentations can work here.) The problem is that a non-existant being doesn't leave proof of it's non-existence. We have no empirical way to prove that the tooth-fairy, Big-foot or leprechaun doesn't exist. But we don't have any sufficent reason to believe they do exist neither. So the best way to calculate the odd, is by an analysis of the given definition and the confrontation of that definition to the known world. By exemple: E picurus' argument from evil tends to demonstrated that a God defined as omnipotant and omnibenevolent is incompatible with a world where evil does exist. So if we can demonstrate that evil exist (war, famine, child abuse, etc.) then we can conclude that such a definition of God is incompatible with our world and has 0% chance of existing in it. Some other definitions of God, like a «natural» or «pantheist» interpretation are coherant and so vague that we absolutly can't disprove them. Nor can we calculate the odd. So, the answer will be either: 0% or impossible to calculate depending of the given definition. All we need is a working definition, one that we can test empirically or logically, and compare it to the facts. 173 Views · View Upvoters   Draco Valdez , Guitarist, Composer at Monado Answered Jan 24, 2018 Originally Answered: What are the chances of the existence of God? Well…it's not good at this juncture. I will say that on the surface, the possibility for the exsistence of God is the same as the possibility that it doesnt. The reason I think we can say with some confidence that the chances of no God is greater is that things we used to attribute to God's intervention (like say…the seasons) we have now shown and proven there to be rational explanations and mechanics behind them, and a God is not required to make them tick. We can say the examples we have of God in religion have been shown to be illogical, prone to emotional compromise, violent, and have questionable moral systems. These characteristics are not befitting of the arbiter of the cosmos but seem to be a reflection of the mental fragmentation of human authors. Now this does not mean the magic wizard in the sky does not exsist, because it is within possibility, but it is highly unlikely. I do not see any reason to give credence to the plausibility of the schizophrenic Sky Wizard. As far as there being something metaphysical and abstract that is a force that pervades the universe, which we can call God, that's a different story entirley and in my opinion completely valid as a concept. 45 Views   Or Shefer , Always on to something new Answered Jan 25, 2018 · Author has 286 answers and 24.3k answer views Originally Answered: What are the chances of the existence of God?

And everyone else is wrong, of course. Add that with the fact there is always another explanation, eg with personalexperiences. That amounts to 0%.

Unless, of course, you are comparing it with examples of incidences in which no god is apparent, which would be, literally, every other example .

It should be noted that I am not, by ay means, a mathemetitian, nor a statistician. I am approaching this with only a very limited understanding of how to measure such things, and may be entirely wrong in my approach.

Updated Apr 7, 2018 · Author has 291 answers and 292.7k answer views Assault by firearm is the 10th most likely cause of death in the USA, with the odds at 1 in 300. Not particularly helpful by itself, without some context. The kinds of things that are more likely to kill you include heart disease, #1 at 1 in 6, cancer #2 and 1 in 7, stroke, #3 at 1 in 28, and suicide, #5 at 1 in 115. All of these you can do something about, especially if you're in a high risk category. Accidental poisoning (#6 at 1 in 139) and accidental falls (#7 at 1 in 184) are remarkably more likely than most people think, given how little thought we given them. Your risk of dying from a car accident is just a little greater than getting killed by firearm, at #8, 1 in 272. This is obviously also one where you can move yourself into a low risk category (wear a seat belt, and the four don'ts: speed, dui, drive while tired, or drive while distracted). #9 almost seems like it should go with the suicide category, but with a 1 in 289 risk of dying from drug use it is clearly a category that's easy to avoid being a part of. Which means that, excluding the most common natural causes of death and various kinds of accidents and means of self-harm, guns are the single most likely reason for you to die in the USA . Yay!

Ask New Question   Sam Hoober , Gun Writer, Concealed Carry Advocate, Outdoorsman and Other Answered Jul 28, 2016 · Author has 207 answers and 124.3k answer views This isn’t going to be a wildly accurate answer, but here goes…the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 11,208 homicides by firearm (out of 16,121 homicides total; roughly 70 percent of all homicides), 505 unintentional (keyword there) deaths to firearms and 281 deaths due to discharge of firearm due to completely unknown causes. It’s true that overall deaths by firearms is more than 30,000; most (more than 20,000 of them) are suicides, so those should be set aside. Overall, near as makes no difference (for these purposes) 2.597 million people died in that year. (2013) Of those, 11,994 people were killed by guns in a manner that was not suicide or 0.46 percent (less than half of one percent) of all deaths. Therefore, you could say - in a grossly inaccurate, roundabout way - that the overall odds are 0.46 percent. However, let’s drill that down a little more. What circumstances do you mean? Do you mean purposefully murdered or accidentally shot? Homicide by firearm - 11,208 in 2013 - would account for roughly 0.432 percent of all deaths. Accidental shootings (whether a person accidentally shoots themselves or is accidentally shot by someone else) would account for 0.03 percent of all deaths. I am not a statistician and this is entirely using back-of-the-envelope (so to speak) math. Also, there are other factors that go into the overall risk. Some areas (such as Chicago’s South Side) put a person at a much higher risk than others. Additionally, the CDC doesn’t mention how many of those homicides were gang-related; ostensibly it would be well more than 50 percent, but I couldn’t find any reliable data or even conjectures on that. (I’ve tried.) So, to sum up - the overall chances are less than half a percent, so long as you stay away from known bad neighborhoods and don’t join a criminal gang. Then your chances increase. 20.7k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Michael Losey Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful? Quora User Answered Jan 29, 2017 · Author has 4.6k answers and 9.6m answer views About 11,000 firearms homicides occur in the US. We’ll have to exclude suicides because the question “What are the odds of being shot and killed in the US?” is skewed if one is suicidal, it might be well above 95% if one were to point a gun at oneself and pull the trigger. So we’re talking about being shot and killed by a gun. Well, what the gun control advocates don’t mention is the MAJORITY of people killed in gun violence are gang members and associates, people engaged in criminal activities, and people engaged in high risk activities. So about 5,000 other homicides by firearms remain. Now much of the likely hood of being one of those unfortunates comes down to life choices and occupation. If you’re not a police officer, convenience or liquor store clerk working at night, you’ve reduced it further. Avoiding certain areas is definitely another means of reducing risks. If you don’t live in one of our cesspool cities, you’ve reduced it even more. And if you’ve made common sense choices on spouses, domestic partners and who you let in your life, you’ve reduced it significantly. That said, a friend of my sister’s was working in a department store in the Northern Puget Sound region when a Turkish Moslem walked in and shot her and other people in the head last year. The odds of getting killed by a firearm of people making good choices, not involved in crime, not in bad areas getting shot are very, very small, but when it does happen, it really, really makes the news. 10.1k Views · View Upvoters   Frank Silbermann Answered Mar 31, 2016 · Author has 2.1k answers and 531.7k answer views That's like asking "What are the odds of being sentenced to prison in the US?" or "What are the average American's odds of being appointed Bishop?" You can come up with a statistic of proportional of people shot to death in a given time period, but that says very little about your odds. Regardless of the percentage of people sentenced to prison, a calculation of _your_ odds of being sent to prison is meaningless unless it takes into account whether you do serious crimes. Regardless of the percentage of the general population who become bishops, your odds are virtually zero if you're not a Catholic priest, and even closer to zero if you're not even Catholic. Similarly, your odds of being shot to death primarily depend upon whether you associate with violent people.  If you don't, your odds are far far smaller than the percentage of Americans shot to death.  If you are in a sexual relationship with someone who is very violent, or if you do business with people known to be very violent, or if you socialize with people known to be very violent -- then your odds will be far higher than the percentage of Americans who are shot to death. 5.5k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Ryan Rizner Thank you for your feedback!

If we round down to 300million as the number of people in the country, and estimate about 30,000 people each year die from gunshots, that puts the odds at about 1 in 10K each year. But a huge chunk of those are suicides, and the vast majority of the rest are gang or drug related activity.  So, unless you are a suicidal drug dealer, or intentionally choose to live in extremely high crime areas like the south side of Chicago, you honestly have a greater chance of drowning in a pool or getting killed in a car accident.  Since the number of medical malpractice related deaths are estimated to be upwards of 200,000/year, you actually have a higher chance of being killed by your doctor than you do of getting shot in the US.

Even something as random as being the victim of a place crash has a LOT of variables involved.  If one flies twice a week, their exposure to being involved in a crash is obviously more than one who takes one round trip flight every 20 years. I can't think of many things more random than being hit by lightning, but even the odds of that are greatly affected by different aspects of one's life. 7.6k Views · View Upvoters   Stephen Shoemate Answered Feb 6, 2018 · Author has 228 answers and 6.8k answer views In Chicago or Detroit, it could be a dead certainty. If you are a Black male, stay away from other Black males. They are most likely to shoot you than anybody else. In most cities, you are safe enough unless you frequent unsavory places, or provoke some unbalanced individual. If you are engaging in illegal activities, your chances of eating lead are high, too. You could get shot and killed while visiting a “sanctuary city”, though, by one of the “sanctioned” ones here illegally, using a stolen weapon. Not much of a sanctuary for the legal residents, is it? I personally prefer the company of CCL holders, the more the better. The media tends to hype anything involving a firearm, and speculate wildly at times while waiting for factual information. You are much more likely to be in a car crash. 509 Views · Answer requested by  Eric Dee Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful? Quora User Answered Jun 13, 2016 A back-of-the-envelope estimate of the probability of being shot (wounded or killed) by a firearm in the US, assuming uniform density of shooting incidents across the land and no repeat shooting of the same person, is around [math]0.000735\%[/math] in one year. This is based on the number of gun-related casualties for the last one year gleaned from this source . Again, assuming uniformity of shooting incidents and no net change in gun-related violent behaviour in the US, the odds of being shot rise to [math]0.046\%[/math] over a period of 78.5 years[*], i.e. around one in 2000 people will be shot once through their lives non-fatally. Obviously, the actual distribution of probabilities is going to be highly skewed depending on where one lives and works and which areas one frequents, as some areas are far more prone to gun violence than others due to a variety of reasons.

Robert Jones , Lifelong shooter and gun enthusiast Answered Mar 17, 2017 Well, if you are a criminal perpetrating a crime that would certainly put you in a situation where your risk would be elevated. As a general bystander, odds are pretty slim that you would be shot out of the blue. As of 2011, the NIJ lists firearm crimes as 8% of ALL violent incidents. This includes both fatal and non-fatal incidences. 625 Views   Harry Potter Answered Oct 17, 2017 You are 25 times more likely to get shot in America than in other developed countries. https://www.fastcompany.com/3056... 237 Views Thank you for your feedback!

Both phrases can be used somewhat rhetorically (i.e., not a genuine question, but a question the person feels he or she knows the answer to).

Extremely bad odds that we would meet again (highly unlikely )!  Longman's example: What are the odds that they will mess up?  Extremely good odds that the y will mess up (highly likely )!   Extension of Longman's example: What are the odds that they will succeed up?  Extremely bad odds that the y will succeed (highly unlikely )!

When it is used to express surprise it stands on its own:  "What are the odds!"  When it is part of the larger sentence it is taken more literally.  You are asking how likely it is that the class will be cancelled.

As you say, simply saying "what are the odds?!?" is also an expression of surprise, but for that context, it is generally used as a stand-alone expression.         eni8ma ,  May 25, 2011     #15              to-toni  Member      Russian          Hello!

And I always thought that the meaning of that is "What is the posibility?" because of the word "odds" used which is an analog of "posibility"...

If you flip a coin, the odds are 50-50 you'll get heads.   When we talk about odds, we're talking about probabilities, specifically, how likely it is that something will happen. Is there a 5% chance? Is there a 95% chance? If there's a 95% chance, then the odds are great. We can talk about the odds of anything happening, as long as it hasn't happened yet. Anyone predicting the weather is telling the odds of rain or snow â€” they don't know for sure. If something strange happens people often say, "What were the odds of that?", which means: "I can't believe that happened. The odds were against it."

Maybe you need a way to get out of a tight squeeze, maybe you want to learn how to win every bet. Whatever you need, a quick game of What Are the Odds? will do the trick.          Steps          1   Decide who is daring first. The first person select another player.          2   Ask the other person, "What are the odds you (insert dare here)? "  The second player reply with a number up to 25. Do not go over 25.           3   Both players face each other. Count down from three simultaneously.         4   At one, both players say at the same time a number between one and the number that was selected by the second player.          5   Determine the winner.   If both players say the same number, the person who was dared now has to complete the dare.  If two different numbers are said, the second player does not have to complete the dare.           6   Move on to the next round or end the game. The second player now has a turn to ask, "What are the odds?"

Choose a different number each time.       Warnings    Don't choose a higher number every time, this will annoy other players.  The lower number you choose, the higher chance you have of losing.  If you don't want to accept, simply say, "Pass," rather than answer with 0. If you do say 0 when asked the odds, you are guaranteed a loss.

What are the odds of that?   Each outcome is a rare one. That may sound like a simple question, but it isn’t.  Some would answer the question by stating that the odds of a roulette wheel landing on the number 19 on seven consecutive spins is a simple math problem.  There are 38 numbered pockets on an American roulette wheel, so the odds of a ball landing on 19 in one spin of the wheel would be 1 in 38.  The odds of that happening seven straight times would simply be (1/38)^7, or 1 in 114 billion. 1   An equally plausible response would be that we don’t care that the wheel landed on “19” in seven straight spins, but rather that it landed on the same number for seven straight spins.  In that case, what we really want to know is the likelihood that the wheel lands on any number (odds: 38/38, or 100%) and then lands on that same number again on the next six spins (odds: (1/38)^6).  The odds of that happening are 1 in 3 billion.  But it’s not that simple, either. The question “What are the odds of that?” can, and often should, be interpreted differently. What are the odds of a roulette wheel, on seven consecutive spins, landing in the following order: 10-34-3-9-18-30-21. Take a second and think about that.  …   The answer is 1 in 114 billion. It is 38 times as likely for a roulette wheel to land on the same number seven times in a row than it is to land in the sequence 10-34-3-9-18-30-21.  That’s because 19-19-19-19-19-19-19 is just as likely as 10-34-3-9-18-30-21.  It may not feel that way to you, because 10-34-3-9-18-30-21 isn’t substantially different to you than 4-22-9-30-2-36-18, or a host of other seemingly random results.  Or, as Doug described, consider what happens if you flip a coin ten times and get THHHTTHHTH. What are the odds of that?  “What are the odds of that” is a question that sounds straightforward but is rather complex.  It depends on what you think is the essence of a sequence of coin flips. The odds of getting exactly THHHTTHHTH is 1 in 1024.  But that probably isn’t the essence of the sequence that you are curious about: your chances of getting 6 heads and 4 tails is about 20.5%, and the probability of a 6/4 split one way or the other is about 41%. THHHTTHHTH may be a rare outcome — just like 10-34-3-9-18-30-21 — but every single sequence is a rare outcome when flipping a coin 10 times. Usually, we’re often not interested in the outcome itself . Instead we group outcomes together into the events that we’re interested in. We might be interested in the event “six of one, four of the other,” which consists of a lot of different outcomes. That event is not particularly rare.  Remember my Splits Happen post?  What were the odds that Jacoby Jones would gain three times as many receiving yards against the 8 teams at the back of the alphabet as he would against the 8 teams he faced in the front of the alphabet?  It depends on your perspective.  The actual odds of that specific outcome would be extremely rare, much like THHHTTHHTH.  But the odds that one receiver in the NFL would have a crazy split like that?  Not odd at all, in fact.  With a large enough sample size, it’s bound to happen, which is why I was able to find three other examples in that article.  This is a very good reason why it’s often inappropriate to apply standard significance tests to football statistics. Surely Jones’ splits would pass any standard significance test, signaling that his wild split was in fact “real” even though we know it wasn’t.  With a large enough sample, you would expect to have false positives, which isn’t a knock on standard significant testing.  If something is statistically significant at the 1% level, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t expect to see a false positive if you have 100 different samples.  Scott Kacsmar has written that Aaron Rodgers has a miserable 3-18 record at 4th quarter comeback opportunities , a rate far, far below that of other elite quarterbacks.  Does this mean Rodgers is inherently bad at 4th quarter comebacks?  Maybe so.  You could make some assumptions and run the numbers; maybe you’d find that there is only a 1% 2 chance of Rodgers having such a terrible 4th quarter comeback record if he was as good as other elite quarterbacks in those situations.  So you would confidently conclude: the probability of Rodgers’ record having happened due to chance is extremely low. Therefore, it probably isn’t just chance; he must be inherently bad at 4th quarter comebacks.  . Brett Favre isn't the only one surprised Aaron Rodgers hasn't recorded his fourth 4th quarter comeback yet But that isn’t necessarily appropriate. Even if all elite quarterbacks, Rodgers included, had the exact same odds when it came to 4th quarter comeback opportunities, and therefore chance was completely responsible for any discrepancy in the results, over time, there would undoubtedly still be an elite quarterback like Rodgers who would have that 3-18 record (about 1% of all star quarterbacks, in fact!).  Do you see why?  Some in the statistical community refer to this as the Wyatt Earp Effect.  You’ve undoubtedly heard of Wyatt Earp, who is famous precisely because he survived a large number of duels. What are the odds of that? Well, it depends on your perspective.  The odds that one person would survive a large number of duels?  Given enough time, it becomes a statistical certainty that someone would do just that.  Think back to the famous Warren Buffett debate on the efficient market hypothesis.  Suppose that 225 million Americans partake in a single elimination national coin-flipping contest, with one coin flip per day.  After 20 days, we would expect 215 people to successfully call their coin flips 20 times out of 20.   But that doesn’t mean those 215 people are any better at calling coins than you or I am.  The Wyatt Earp Effect, the National Coin Flipping Example, and my Splits Happen post all illustrate the same principle. Asking “what are the odds of that?” is often meaningless in retrospect. If you look at enough things, enough players’ splits, enough 4th quarter comeback opportunities, enough coin flips, or enough roulette wheel spins, you will see some things that seem absurdly unlikely.  This isn’t to say that Rodgers isn’t particularly bad at 4th quarter comebacks, as the data suggest.  It’s just a reminder that the question “What are the odds of that?” is rarely a straightforward math question, and temptations of the Wyatt Earp trap are often extremely tantalizing and difficult to ignore.  What are the odds of a Roulette Wheel landing on 19 on seven straight spins?  One answer is 1 in 114 billion.  But with 10,000 roulette wheels across America being played virtually non-stop, we would expect one casino in American to hit the same number on 7 spins in a row about once every 15 months .  I am blurring, and will continue to blur, the distinction between odds and probability. Nothing bad will happen as a result. [ ↩ ] If you assume Rodgers has a 40% chance of succeeding at 4th quarter comebacks — arguably a low estimate for star quarterbacks — then there is only a 1% chance that he would win 3 or fewer times in 21 opportunities.

LET'S START SMALL What is the probability of your dad meeting your mom? Though the world was smaller 20 years ago, your dad could have met almost 200 million of its women (go dad!) But over 25 years, he probably met around 10,000 women. So the odds that your mom was in this small group and met your dad is: 1 in 20,000  BUT WE KNOW HOW TRICKY LOVE CAN BE. What is the probability that they stay together long enough to have kids? It is a 1 in 10 chance that they talk to each other. Also a 1 in 10 chance that they go on a second date. Another 1 in 10 chance that they keep dating for a while. And a coin toss if they stay together long enough for offspring. Thus, the odds that your parents' meeting results in kids is: 1 in 2,000  So far, the combines odds of you being here are: 1 in 40,000,000 That is about the size of the population of California.  NOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET PRETTY INTERESTING Why? Because we are about to deal with eggs and sperm, which come in large numbers. Mom has about 100,000 eggs in her lifetime. Dad makes about 4 trillion sperm during the years you could have been born.  What are the odds that the 1 egg... (Sally)... ...met the 1 sperm, which together made you(and not your brother)? (Harry) 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 400 quadrillion)That is approximately the volume in cubic meters of the Atlantic Ocean (3,236x10 17 cubic meters).  BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED Because your existence here, now, and on planet earth presupposes another supremely unlikely and utterly undeniable chain of events. Namely, that every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age- going all the way back not just to the first Homo sapiens, first Homo erectus and Homo habilis, but all the way back to the first single-celled organism. You are a representative of an unbroken lineage of life going back 4 billion years.  What are the odds that you lineage remained unbroken for the length of human existence? (You.Aw.) 1 in 2 odds that a child will be born, grow, and reproduce per generation... ... for 150,000 generations  1 in 10  45,000 That's a 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it.  How large is that number? That number is not just larger than all the particles in the universe-it is larger that all the particles in the universe if each particle were itself a universe.  THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. The right sperm also had to meet the right egg for every single one of those ancestors.  (Weeeee!) ODDS OF THE RIGHT SPERM, MEETING THE RIGHT EGG 150,000 TIMES? 1 in 10 2,640,000 That is 1 quadrillion multiplied by 1 quadrillion for every generation.  Let's add it all up  10 2,640,000 x 10 45,000 x 2000 x 20,000= 1 in 10 2,685,000  BY COMPARISON: The number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg. 175 lb) is about: 10 27 The number of atoms making up the earth is about: 10 50 The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at: 10 80  THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: It is the probability of 2 million people getting together (about the population of San Diego) each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up with the exact same number-for example, 550,343,279,001.  SO, THE ODDS THAT YOU EXIST AT ALL ARE: BASICALLY ZERO.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, we have just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and ac like the miracle that you are.

(March 2016)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Odds are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics . In statistics, the odds for or odds of some event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while odds against reflect the likelihood that it will not. In gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event. [1] [2] Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event.  In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. [3] Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker ) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. In simplest terms, 6 to 1 odds means if you bet a dollar (the "1" in the expression), and you win you get paid six dollars (the "6" in the expression), or 6 x 1. If you bet two dollars you would be paid twelve dollars, or 6 x 2. If you bet three dollars and win, you would be paid eighteen dollars, or 6 x 3. If you bet one hundred dollars and win you would be paid six hundred dollars, or 6 x 100. If you lose any of those bets you would lose the dollar, or two dollars, or three dollars, or one hundred dollars.  In statistics, the odds for an event E are defined as a simple function of the probability of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the uncertainty of this possible event as odds for is that to regain the probability requires a calculation. The natural way to interpret odds for (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) odds for rolling six with a fair die (one of a pair of dice ) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 six event for every 5 times the die does not show six. For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 sixes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) odds against, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the odds against rolling a six with a fair die are 5 to 1. The probability of rolling a six with a fair die is the single number 1/6, roughly 0.17.  The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a six will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a six and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a six, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a six and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no advantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. Casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the United States. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.

[4] Shakespeare wrote:   Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one  — William Shakespeare , Henry IV, Part II , Act I, Scene 1 lines 181–2.   The sixteenth century polymath Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes [5] ).  Terminology [ edit ]  Odds are expressed in the form X to Y, where X and Y are numbers. Usually, the word "to" is replaced by a symbol for ease of use. This is conventionally either a slash or hyphen , although a colon is sometimes seen. Thus, 6/1, 6-1 and 6:1 are all interchangeable.  Odds against [ edit ]  When the probability that the event will not happen is greater than the probability that it will, then the odds are "against" that event happening. Odds of 6 to 1, for example, are therefore sometimes said to be "6 to 1 against ". To a gambler, "odds against" means that the amount he or she will win is greater than the amount staked.  Odds on [ edit ]  "Odds on" is the opposite of "odds against". It means that the event is more likely to happen than not. This is sometimes expressed with the smaller number first (1 to 2) but more often using the word "on" ("2 to 1 on ") meaning that the event is twice as likely to happen as not. Note that the gambler who bets at "odds on" and wins will still be in profit, as his stake will be returned. For example, on a $2 bet, the gambler will be given $1 plus the returned stake of $2, yielding a $1 profit.  Even odds [ edit ]  Main article: Even money  "Even odds" occur when the probability of an event happening is exactly the same as it not happening. In common parlance, this is a "50-50 chance". Guessing heads or tails on a coin toss is the classic example of an event that has even odds. In gambling, it is commonly referred to as " even money " or simply "evens" (1 to 1, or 2 for 1). "Evens" implies that the payout will be one unit per unit wagered plus the original stake, that is, "double-your-money".  Better than/worse than evens [ edit ]  The term "better than evens" (or "worse than evens") varies in meaning depending on context. Looked at from the perspective of a gambler rather than a statistician, "better than evens" means "odds against". If the odds are evens (1:1), and one bets 10 units, one would be returned 20 units, making a profit of 10 units. If the gamble was paying 4:1 and the event occurred, one would make 50 units, or a profit of 40 units. So, it is "better than evens" from the gambler's perspective because it pays out more than one-for-one. If an event is more likely to occur than an even chance, then the odds will be "worse than evens", and the bookmaker will pay out less than one-for-one.  However, in popular parlance surrounding uncertain events, the expression "better than evens" usually implies a greater than 50% chance of the event occurring, which is exactly the opposite of the meaning of the expression when used in a gaming context.  Statistical usage [ edit ]  In statistics, odds are an expression of relative probabilities, generally quoted as the odds in favor . The odds (in favor) of an event or a proposition is the ratio of the probability that the event will happen to the probability that the event will not happen. Mathematically, this is a Bernoulli trial , as it has exactly two outcomes. In case of a finite sample space of equally likely outcomes , this is the ratio of the number of outcomes where the event occurs to the number of outcomes where the event does not occur; these can be represented as W and L (for Wins and Losses) or S and F (for Success and Failure). For example, the odds that a randomly chosen day of the week is a weekend are two to five (2:5), as days of the week form a sample space of seven outcomes, and the event occurs for two of the outcomes (Saturday and Sunday), and not for the other five. [6] [7] Conversely, given odds as a ratio of integers, this can be represented by a probability space of a finite number of equally likely outcomes. These definitions are equivalent, since dividing both terms in the ratio by the number of outcomes yields the probabilities:     2  :  5  =  (  2   /   7  )  :  (  5   /   7  )  .    {\displaystyle 2:5=(2/7):(5/7).}   Conversely, the odds against is the opposite ratio. For example, the odds against a random day of the week being a weekend are 5:2.  Odds and probability can be expressed in prose via the prepositions to and in: "odds of so many to so many on (or against) [some event]" refers to odds – the ratio of numbers of (equally likely) outcomes in favor and against (or vice versa); "chances of so many [outcomes], in so many [outcomes]" refers to probability – the number of (equally like) outcomes in favour relative to the number for and against combined. For example, "odds of a weekend are 2 to 5", while "chances of a weekend are 2 in 7". In casual use, the words odds and chances (or chance ) are often used interchangeably to vaguely indicate some measure of odds or probability, though the intended meaning can be deduced by noting whether the preposition between the two numbers is to or in . [8] [9] [10]  Mathematical relations [ edit ]  Odds can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, in which case it is not unique – scaling both terms by the same factor does not change the proportions: 1:1 odds and 100:100 odds are the same (even odds). Odds can also be expressed as a number, by dividing the terms in the ratio – in this case it is unique (different fractions can represent the same rational number ). Odds as a ratio, odds as a number, and probability (also a number) are related by simple formulas, and similarly odds in favor and odds against, and probability of success and probability of failure have simple relations. Odds range from 0 to infinity, while probabilities range from 0 to 1, and hence are often represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%: reversing the ratio switches odds for with odds against, and similarly probability of success with probability of failure.  Given odds (in favor) as the ratio W:L (Wins:Losses), the odds in favor (as a number)      o   f      {\displaystyle o_{f}}   and odds against (as a number)      o   a      {\displaystyle o_{a}}   can be computed by simply dividing, and are multiplicative inverses :            o   f       =  W   /   L  =  1   /    o   a         o   a       =  L   /   W  =  1   /    o   f         o   f    ⋅   o   a       =  1        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}o_{f}&=W/L=1/o_{a}\\o_{a}&=L/W=1/o_{f}\\o_{f}\cdot o_{a}&=1\end{aligned}}}     Analogously, given odds as a ratio, the probability of success or failure can be computed by dividing, and the probability of success and probability of failure sum to unity (one), as they are the only possible outcomes. In case of a finite number of equally likely outcomes, this can be interpreted as the number of outcomes where the event occurs divided by the total number of events:           p     =  W   /   (  W  +  L  )  =  1  −  q      q     =  L   /   (  W  +  L  )  =  1  −  p      p  +  q     =  1        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=W/(W+L)=1-q\\q&=L/(W+L)=1-p\\p+q&=1\end{aligned}}}     Given a probability p, the odds as a ratio is     p  :  q    {\displaystyle p:q}   (probability of success to probability of failure), and the odds as numbers can be computed by dividing:            o   f       =  p   /   q  =  p   /   (  1  −  p  )  =  (  1  −  q  )   /   q       o   a       =  q   /   p  =  (  1  −  p  )   /   p  =  q   /   (  1  −  q  )        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}o_{f}&=p/q=p/(1-p)=(1-q)/q\\o_{a}&=q/p=(1-p)/p=q/(1-q)\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, given the odds as a number      o   f    ,    {\displaystyle o_{f},}   this can be represented as the ratio      o   f    :  1  ,    {\displaystyle o_{f}:1,}   or conversely     1  :  (  1   /    o   f    )  =  1  :   o   a    ,    {\displaystyle 1:(1/o_{f})=1:o_{a},}   from which the probability of success or failure can be computed:           p     =   o   f     /   (   o   f    +  1  )  =  1   /   (   o   a    +  1  )      q     =   o   a     /   (   o   a    +  1  )  =  1   /   (   o   f    +  1  )        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=o_{f}/(o_{f}+1)=1/(o_{a}+1)\\q&=o_{a}/(o_{a}+1)=1/(o_{f}+1)\end{aligned}}}     Thus if expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1, probability and odds differ by exactly 1 in the denominator: a probability of 1 in 100 (1/100 = 1%) is the same as odds of 1 to 99 (1/99 = 0.0101… = 0. 01 ), while odds of 1 to 100 (1/100 = 0.01) is the same as a probability of 1 in 101 (1/101 = 0.00990099… = 0. 0099 ). This is a minor difference if the probability is small (close to zero, or "long odds"), but is a major difference if the probability is large (close to one).  These are worked out for some simple odds:    odds (ratio)       o   f      {\displaystyle o_{f}}         o   a      {\displaystyle o_{a}}        p    {\displaystyle p}        q    {\displaystyle q}      1:1  1  1  50%  50%    0:1  0  ∞  0%  100%    1:0  ∞  0  100%  0%    2:1  2  0.5  67%  33%    1:2  0.5  2  33%  67%    4:1  4  0.25  80%  20%    1:4  0.25  4  20%  80%       9:1  9  0. 1  90%  10%    10:1  10  0.1  90. 90 %  9. 09 %    99:1  99  0. 01  99%  1%    100:1  100  0.01  99. 0099 %  0. 90 %    These transforms have certain special geometric properties: the conversions between odds for and odds against (resp. probability of success with probability of failure) and between odds and probability are all Möbius transformations (fractional linear transformations). They are thus specified by three points ( sharply 3-transitive ). Swapping odds for and odds against swaps 0 and infinity, fixing 1, while swapping probability of success with probability of failure swaps 0 and 1, fixing .5; these are both order 2, hence circular transforms . Converting odds to probability fixes 0, sends infinity to 1, and sends 1 to .5 (even odds are 50% likely), and conversely; this is a parabolic transform .  Applications [ edit ]  In probability theory and Bayesian statistics , odds may sometimes be more natural or more convenient than probabilities. This is often the case in problems of sequential decision making as for instance in problems of how to stop (online) on a last specific event which is solved by the odds algorithm . Similar ratios are used elsewhere in Bayesian statistics, such as the Bayes factor .  The odds are a ratio of probabilities; an odds ratio is a ratio of odds, that is, a ratio of ratios of probabilities. Odds-ratios are often used in analysis of clinical trials . While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter- intuitive results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is four times more likely to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the odds are 16 times higher on the less likely event (4–1 against , or 4) than on the more likely one (1–4, or 4–1 on , or 0.25).  In some cases the log-odds are used, which is the logit of the probability. Most simply, odds are frequently multiplied or divided, and log converts multiplication to addition and division to subtractions.   Example #1  There are 5 pink marbles, 2 blue marbles, and 8 purple marbles. What are the odds in favor of picking a blue marble?   Answer: The odds in favour of a blue marble are 2:13. One can equivalently say, that the odds are 13:2 against . There are 2 out of 15 chances in favour of blue, 13 out of 15 against blue.  In probability theory and statistics , where the variable p is the probability in favor of a binary event, and the probability against the event is therefore 1- p , "the odds" of the event are the quotient of the two, or       p   1  −  p       {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{1-p}}}   . That value may be regarded as the relative probability the event will happen, expressed as a fraction (if it is less than 1), or a multiple (if it is equal to or greater than one) of the likelihood that the event will not happen.  In the very first example at top, saying the odds of a Sunday are "one to six" or, less commonly, "one-sixth" means the probability of picking a Sunday randomly is one-sixth the probability of not picking a Sunday. While the mathematical probability of an event has a value in the range from zero to one, "the odds" in favor of that same event lie between zero and infinity. The odds against the event with probability given as p are        1  −  p   p      {\displaystyle {\frac {1-p}{p}}}   . The odds against Sunday are 6:1 or  6/1 = 6. It is 6 times as likely that a random day is not a Sunday.   Example #2  There are 5 red marbles, 2 green marbles, and 8 yellow marbles. What are the odds against picking a yellow marble?   Answer: 7:8  Gambling usage [ edit ]  The use of odds in gambling facilitates betting on events where the relative probabilities of outcomes varied. For example, on a coin toss or a match race between two evenly matched horses, it is reasonable for two people to wager level stakes. However, in more variable situations, such as a multi-runner horse race or a football match between two unequally matched sides, betting "at odds" provides a perspective on the relative likelihoods of the possible outcomes.  In the modern era, most fixed odds betting takes place between a betting organisation, such as a bookmaker , and an individual, rather than between individuals. Different traditions have grown up in how to express odds to customers, older eras came with betting odds between people, today which is illegal in most countries, it was referred as "odding", an underground slang word with origins based in the Bronx.  Fractional odds [ edit ]  Favoured by bookmakers in the United Kingdom and Ireland , and also common in horse racing , fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the bettor, should he or she win, relative to the stake. [11] Odds of 4/1 would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake. If the odds are 1/4, the bettor will make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, having won, the bettor always receives the original stake back; so if the odds are 4/1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as evens or even money .  The numerator and denominator of fractional odds are always integers , thus if the bookmaker's payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator . For example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.  Fractional odds are also known as British odds,  UK odds, [12] or, in that country, traditional odds . They are typically represented with a "/" but can also be represented with a "-", e.g. 4/1 or 4-1. Odds with a denominator of 1 are often presented in listings as the numerator only. [ citation needed ]  A variation of fractional odds is known as Hong Kong odds. Fractional and Hong Kong odds are actually exchangeable. The only difference is that the UK odds are presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong odds are decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.  The European odds also represent the potential winnings (net returns), but in addition they factor in the stake (e.g. 6/5 or 1.2 plus 1 = 2.2). [13]  Decimal odds [ edit ]  Favoured in continental Europe , Australia , New Zealand and Canada , decimal odds quote the ratio of the payout amount, including the original stake, to the stake itself. [14] Decimal odds are generally considered the easiest to deal with as they reflect the inverse of the probability of an outcome. [15] Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one. [16] Thus even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2.00. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5.00, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. This is considered to be ideal for parlay betting, because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on. Decimal odds are also favoured by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading.  Decimal odds are also known as European odds , digital odds or continental odds. [12]  Moneyline odds [ edit ]  Main article: moneyline odds  Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. The figure quoted is either positive or negative.   When moneyline odds are positive, the figure indicates how much money will be won on a $100 wager (this is done for an outcome that is considered less likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 4/1 would be quoted as +400.  When moneyline odds are negative, the figure indicates how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done for an outcome is considered more likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 1/4 would be quoted as -400.   Moneyline odds are often referred to as American odds . A "Moneyline" wager refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread . In most cases, the favorite will have negative moneyline odds (less payoff for a safer bet) and the underdog will have positive moneyline odds (more payoff for a risky bet). However, if the teams are evenly matched, both teams can have a negative line at the same time (e.g. -110 -110 or -105 -115), due to house take.  Gambling odds versus probabilities [ edit ]  Main article: Mathematics of bookmaking  In gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the bookmaker will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. In formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful bettor is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. This profit is known as the 'over-round' on the 'book' (the 'book' refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term 'bookmaker') and relates to the sum of the 'odds' in the following way:  In a 3-horse race, for example, the true probabilities of each of the horses winning based on their relative abilities may be 50%, 40% and 10%. The total of these three percentages is 100%, thus representing a fair 'book'. The true odds against winning for each of the three horses are 1-1, 3-2 and 9-1 respectively.  In order to generate a profit on the wagers accepted, the bookmaker may decide to increase the values to 60%, 50% and 20% for the three horses, respectively. This represents the odds against each, which are 4-6, 1-1 and 4-1, in order. These values now total 130%, meaning that the book has an overround of 30 (130−100). This value of 30 represents the amount of profit for the bookmaker if he gets bets in good proportions on each of the horses. For example, if he takes £60, £50, and £20 of stakes respectively for the three horses, he receives £130 in wagers but only pays £100 back (including stakes), whichever horse wins. And the expected value of his profit is positive even if everybody bets on the same horse. The art of bookmaking is in setting the odds low enough so as to have a positive expected value of profit while keeping the odds high enough to attract customers, and at the same time attracting enough bets for each outcome to reduce his risk exposure.  A study on soccer betting found that the probability for the home team to win was generally about 3.4% less than the value calculated from the odds (for example, 46.6% for even odds). It was about 3.7% less for wins by the visitors, and 5.7% less for draws. [17]  Making a profit in gambling involves predicting the relationship of the true probabilities to the payout odds. Sports information services are often used by professional and semi-professional sports bettors to help achieve this goal.  The odds or amounts the bookmaker will pay are determined by the total amount that has been bet on all of the possible events. They reflect the balance of wagers on either side of the event, and include the deduction of a bookmaker's brokerage fee ("vig" or vigorish ).  Also, depending on how the betting is affected by jurisdiction, taxes may be involved for the bookmaker and/or the winning player. This may be taken into account when offering the odds and/or may reduce the amount won by a player.

At about the same time, Don C. Wiley mysteriously disappeared. His car, a white rented Mitsubishi Galant, was abandoned on a bridge outside of Memphis, where he had just had a jovial dinner with friends. The following week, Vladimir Pasechnik collapsed in London, apparently of a stroke. The list would grow to nearly a dozen in the space of four nerve-jangling months. Stabbed in Leesburg, Va. Suffocated in an air-locked lab in Geelong, Australia. Found wedged under a chair, naked from the waist down, in a blood-splattered apartment in Norwich, England. Hit by a car while jogging. Killed in a private plane crash. Shot dead while a pizza delivery man served as a decoy. What joined these men was their proximity to the world of bioterror and germ warfare. Que, the one who was car-jacked, was a researcher at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Wiley, the most famous, knew as much as anyone about how the immune system responds to attacks from viruses like Ebola. Pasechnik was Russian, and before he defected, he helped the Soviets transform cruise missiles into biological weapons. The chain of deaths -- these three men and eight others like them -- began last fall, back when emergency teams in moonsuits were scouring the Capitol, when postal workers were dying, when news agencies were on high alert and the entire nation was afraid to open its mail. In more ordinary times, this cluster of deaths might not have been noticed, but these are not ordinary times. Neighbors report neighbors to the F.B.I.; passengers are escorted off planes because they make other passengers nervous; medical journals debate what to publish, for fear the articles will be read by evil eyes. Now we are spooked and startled by stories like these -- all these scientists dying within months of one another, at the precise moment when tiny organisms loom as a gargantuan threat. The stories of these dozen or so deaths started out as a curiosity and were transformed rumor by rumor into the specter of conspiracy as they circulated first on the Internet and then in the mainstream media. What are the odds, after all?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   What are the odds, indeed? For this is not about conspiracy but about coincidence -- unexpected connections that are both riveting and rattling. Much religious faith is based on the idea that almost nothing is coincidence; science is an exercise in eliminating the taint of coincidence; police work is often a feint and parry between those trying to prove coincidence and those trying to prove complicity. Without coincidence, there would be few movies worth watching (''Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine''), and literary plots would come grinding to a disappointing halt. (What if Oedipus had not happened to marry his mother? If Javert had not happened to arrive in the town where Valjean was mayor?)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The true meaning of the word is ''a surprising concurrence of events, perceived as meaningfully related, with no apparent causal connection.'' In other words, pure happenstance. Yet by merely noticing a coincidence, we elevate it to something that transcends its definition as pure chance. We are discomforted by the idea of a random universe. Like Mel Gibson's character Graham Hess in M. Night Shyamalan's new movie ''Signs,'' we want to feel that our lives are governed by a grand plan. The need is especially strong in an age when paranoia runs rampant. ''Coincidence feels like a loss of control perhaps,'' says John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple University and the author of ''Innumeracy,'' the improbable best seller about how Americans don't understand numbers. Finding a reason or a pattern where none actually exists ''makes it less frightening,'' he says, because events get placed in the realm of the logical. ''Believing in fate, or even conspiracy, can sometimes be more comforting than facing the fact that sometimes things just happen.'' In the past year there has been plenty of conspiracy, of course, but also a lot of things have ''just happened.'' And while our leaders are out there warning us to be vigilant, the statisticians are out there warning that patterns are not always what they seem. We need to be reminded, Paulos and others say, that most of the time patterns that seem stunning to us aren't even there. For instance, although the numbers 9/11 (9 plus 1 plus 1) equal 11, and American Airlines Flight 11 was the first to hit the twin towers, and there were 92 people on board (9 plus 2), and Sept. 11 is the 254th day of the year (2 plus 5 plus 4), and there are 11 letters each in ''Afghanistan,'' ''New York City'' and ''the Pentagon'' (and while we're counting, in George W. Bush), and the World Trade towers themselves took the form of the number 11, this seeming numerical message is not actually a pattern that exists but merely a pattern we have found. (After all, the second flight to hit the towers was United Airlines Flight 175, and the one that hit the Pentagon was American Airlines Flight 77, and the one that crashed in a Pennsylvania field was United Flight 93, and the Pentagon is shaped, well, like a pentagon.) The same goes for the way we think of miraculous intervention. We need to be told that those lucky last-minute stops for an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's or to pick up a watch at the repair shop or to vote in the mayoral primary -- stops that saved lives of people who would otherwise have been in the towers when the first plane hit -- certainly looked like miracles but could have been predicted by statistics. So, too, can the most breathtaking of happenings -- like the sparrow that happened to appear at one memorial service just as a teenage boy, at the lectern eulogizing his mom, said the word ''mother.'' The tiny bird lighted on the boy's head; then he took it in his hand and set it free. Something like that has to be more than coincidence, we protest. What are the odds? The mathematician will answer that even in the most unbelievable situations, the odds are actually very good. The law of large numbers says that with a large enough denominator -- in other words, in a big wide world -- stuff will happen, even very weird stuff. ''The really unusual day would be one where nothing unusual happens,'' explains Persi Diaconis, a Stanford statistician who has spent his career collecting and studying examples of coincidence. Given that there are 280 million people in the United States, he says, ''280 times a day, a one-in-a-million shot is going to occur.'' Throw your best story at him -- the one about running into your childhood playmate on a street corner in Azerbaijan or marrying a woman who has a birthmark shaped like a shooting star that is a perfect match for your own or dreaming that your great-aunt Lucy would break her collarbone hours before she actually does -- and he will nod politely and answer that such things happen all the time. In fact, he and his colleagues also warn me that although I pulled all examples in the prior sentence from thin air, I will probably get letters from readers saying one of those things actually happened to them. And what of the deaths of nearly a dozen scientists? Is it really possible that they all just happened to die, most in such peculiar, jarring ways, within so short a time? ''We can never say for a fact that something isn't a conspiracy,'' says Bradley Efron, a professor of statistics at Stanford. ''We can just point out the odds that it isn't.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I first found myself wondering about coincidence last spring when I read a small news item out of the tiny Finnish town of Raahe, which is 370 miles north of Helsinki. On the morning of March 5, two elderly twin brothers were riding their bicycles, as was their habit, completing their separate errands. At 9:30, one brother was struck by a truck along coastal Highway 8 and killed instantly. About two hours later and one mile down the same highway, the other brother was struck by a second truck and killed. ''It was hard to believe this could happen just by chance,'' says Marko Salo, the senior constable who investigated both deaths for the Raahe Police Department. Instead, the department looked for a cause, thinking initially that the second death was really a suicide. ''Almost all Raahe thought he did it knowing that his brother was dead,'' Salo says of the second brother's death. ''They thought he tried on purpose. That would have explained things.'' But the investigation showed that the older brother was off cheerfully getting his hair cut just before his own death. The family could not immediately accept that this was random coincidence, either. ''It was their destiny,'' offers their nephew, who spoke with me on behalf of the family. It is his opinion that his uncles shared a psychic bond throughout their lives. When one brother became ill, the other one fell ill shortly thereafter. When one reached to scratch his nose, the other would often do the same. Several years ago, one brother was hit and injured by a car (also while biking), and the other one developed pain in the same leg. The men's sister had still another theory entirely. ''She worried that it was a plot to kill both of them,'' the nephew says, describing his aunt's concerns that terrorists might have made their way to Raahe. ''She was angry. She wanted to blame someone. So she said the chances of this happening by accident are impossible.'' Not true, the statisticians say. But before we can see the likelihood for what it is, we have to eliminate the distracting details. We are far too taken, Efron says, with superfluous facts and findings that have no bearing on the statistics of coincidence. After our initial surprise, Efron says that the real yardstick for measuring probability is ''How surprised should we be?'' How surprising is it, to use this example, that two 70-year-old men in the same town should die within two hours of each other? Certainly not common, but not unimaginable. But the fact that they were brothers would seem to make the odds more astronomical. This, however, is a superfluous fact. What is significant in their case is that two older men were riding bicycles along a busy highway in a snowstorm, which greatly increases the probability that they would be hit by trucks. Statisticians like Efron emphasize that when something striking happens, it only incidentally happens to us. When the numbers are large enough, and the distracting details are removed, the chance of anything is fairly high. Imagine a meadow, he says, and then imagine placing your finger on a blade of grass. The chance of choosing exactly that blade of grass would be one in a million or even higher, but because it is a certainty that you will choose a blade of grass, the odds of one particular one being chosen are no more or less than the one to either side. Robert J. Tibshirani, a statistician at Stanford University who proved that it was probably not coincidence that accident rates increase when people simultaneously drive and talk on a cellphone, leading some states to ban the practice, uses the example of a hand of poker. ''The chance of getting a royal flush is very low,'' he says, ''and if you were to get a royal flush, you would be surprised. But the chance of any hand in poker is low. You just don't notice when you get all the others; you notice when you get the royal flush.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   When these professors talk, they do so slowly, aware that what they are saying is deeply counterintuitive. No sooner have they finished explaining that the world is huge and that any number of unlikely things are likely to happen than they shift gears and explain that the world is also quite small, which explains an entire other type of coincidence. One relatively simple example of this is ''the birthday problem.'' There are as many as 366 days in a year (accounting for leap years), and so you would have to assemble 367 people in a room to absolutely guarantee that two of them have the same birthday. But how many people would you need in that room to guarantee a 50 percent chance of at least one birthday match? Intuitively, you assume that the answer should be a relatively large number. And in fact, most people's first guess is 183, half of 366. But the actual answer is 23. In Paulos's book, he explains the math this way: ''[T]he number of ways in which five dates can be chosen (allowing for repetitions) is (365 x 365 x 365 x 365 x 365). Of all these 3655 ways, however, only (365 x 364 x 363 x 362 x 361) are such that no two of the dates are the same; any of the 365 days can be chosen first, any of the remaining 364 can be chosen second and so on. Thus, by dividing this latter product (365 x 364 x 363 x 362 x 361) by 3655, we get the probability that five persons chosen at random will have no birthday in common. Now, if we subtract this probability from 1 (or from 100 percent if we're dealing with percentages), we get the complementary probability that at least two of the five people do have a birthday in common. A similar calculation using 23 rather than 5 yields 1/2, or 50 percent, as the probability that at least 2 of 23 people will have a common birthday.'' Got that? Using similar math, you can calculate that if you want even odds of finding two people born within one day of each other, you only need 14 people, and if you are looking for birthdays a week apart, the magic number is seven. (Incidentally, if you are looking for an even chance that someone in the room will have your exact birthday, you will need 253 people.) And yet despite numbers like these, we are constantly surprised when we meet a stranger with whom we share a birth date or a hometown or a middle name. We are amazed by the overlap -- and we conveniently ignore the countless things we do not have in common. which brings us to the death of Benito Que, who was not, despite reports to the contrary, actually a microbiologist. He was a researcher in a lab at the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center, where he was testing various agents as potential cancer drugs. He never worked with anthrax or any infectious disease, according to Dr. Bach Ardalan, a professor of medicine at the University of Miami and Que's boss for the past three years. ''There is no truth to the talk that Benito was doing anything related to microbiology,'' Ardalan says. ''He certainly wasn't doing any sensitive kind of work that anyone would want to hurt him for.'' But those facts got lost amid the confusion -- and the prevalence of very distracting details -- in the days after he died. So did the fact that he had hypertension. On the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19, Que attended a late-afternoon lab meeting, and as it ended, he mentioned that he hadn't been feeling well. A nurse took Que's blood pressure, which was 190/110. ''I wanted to admit him'' to the hospital, Ardalan says, but Que insisted on going home. Que had the habit of parking his car on Northwest 10th Avenue, a side street that Ardalan describes as being ''beyond the area considered to be safe.'' His spot that day was in front of a house where a young boy was playing outside. Four youths approached Que as he neared his car, the boy later told the police, and there might have been some baseball bats involved. When the police arrived, they found Que unconscious. His briefcase was at his side, but his wallet was gone. His car was eventually found abandoned several miles from the scene. He was taken to the hospital, the same one at which he worked, where he spent more than a week in a coma before dying without ever regaining consciousness. The mystery, limited to small items in local Florida papers at first, was ''What killed Benito Que?'' Could it have been the mugging? A CAT scan showed no signs of bony fracture. In fact, there were no scrapes or bruises or other physical signs of assault. Perhaps he died of a stroke? His brain scan did show a ''huge intracranial bleed,'' Ardalan says, which would have explained his earlier headache, and his high blood pressure would have made a stroke likely. In other words, this man just happened to be mugged when he was a stroke waiting to be triggered. That is a jarring coincidence, to be sure. But it is not one that the world was likely to have noticed if Don Wiley had not up and disappeared.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Don C. Wiley was a microbiologist. He did some work with anthrax, and a lot of work with H.I.V., and he was also quite familiar with Ebola, smallpox, herpes and influenza. At 57, he was the father of four children and a professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the department of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard. On Nov. 15, four days before the attack on Benito Que, Wiley was in Memphis to visit his father and to attend the annual meeting of the scientific advisory board of St. Jude's Research Hospital, of which he was a member. At midnight, he was seen leaving a banquet at the Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis. Friends and colleagues say he had a little to drink but did not appear impaired, and they remember him as being in a fine mood, looking forward to seeing his wife and children, who were about to join him for a short vacation. Wiley's father lives in a Memphis suburb, and that is where Wiley should have been headed after the banquet. Instead, his car was found facing in the opposite direction on the Hernando DeSoto Bridge, which spans the Mississippi River at the border of Tennessee and Arkansas. When the police found the car at 4 a.m., it was unlocked, the keys were in the ignition and the gas tank was full. There was a scrape of yellow paint on the driver's side, which appeared to come from a construction sign on the bridge, and a right hubcap was missing on the passenger side, where the wheel rims were also scraped. There was no sign, however, of Don Wiley. The police trawled the muddy Mississippi, but they didn't really expect to find him. Currents run fast at that part of the river, and a body would be quickly swept away. At the start of the search, they thought he might have committed suicide; others had jumped from the DeSoto Bridge over the years. Detectives searched Wiley's financial records, his family relationships, his scientific research -- anything for a hint that the man might have had cause to take his own life. Finding nothing, the investigation turned medical. Wiley, they learned, had a seizure disorder that he had hidden from all but family and close friends. He had a history of two or three major episodes a year, his wife told investigators, and the condition was made worse when he was under stress or the influence of alcohol. Had Wiley, who could well have been tired, disoriented by bridge construction and under the influence of a few drinks, had a seizure that sent him over the side of the bridge? That was the theory the police spoke of in public, but they were also considering something else. The week that Wiley disappeared coincided with the peak of anthrax fear throughout the country. Tainted letters appeared the month before at the Senate and the House of Representatives. Two weeks earlier, a New York City hospital worker died of inhaled anthrax. Memphis was not untouched by the scare; a federal judge and two area congressmen each received hoax letters. Could it be mere chance that this particular scientist, who had profound knowledge of these microbes, had disappeared at this time? ''The circumstances were peculiar,'' says George Bolds, a spokesman for the Memphis bureau of the F.B.I., which was called in to assist. ''There were questions that had to be asked. Could he have been kidnapped because his scientific abilities would have made him capable of creating anthrax? Or maybe he'd had some involvement in the mailing of the anthrax, and he'd disappeared to cover his tracks? Did his co-conspirators grab him and kill him? ''We were in new territory,'' Bolds continued. ''Just because something is conceivable doesn't mean it's actually happened, but at the same time, just because it's never happened before doesn't mean it can't happen. People's ideas of what is possible definitely changed on Sept. 11. People feel less secure and less safe. I'm not sure that they're at greater risk than they were before. Maybe they're just more aware of the risk they are actually at.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   As a species, we appear to be biologically programmed to see patterns and conspiracies, and this tendency increases when we sense that we're in danger. ''We are hard-wired to overreact to coincidences,'' says Persi Diaconis. ''It goes back to primitive man. You look in the bush, it looks like stripes, you'd better get out of there before you determine the odds that you're looking at a tiger. The cost of being flattened by the tiger is high. Right now, people are noticing any kind of odd behavior and being nervous about it.'' Adds John Allen Paulos: ''Human beings are pattern-seeking animals. It might just be part of our biology that conspires to make coincidences more meaningful than they really are. Look at the natural world of rocks and plants and rivers: it doesn't offer much evidence for superfluous coincidences, but primitive man had to be alert to all anomalies and respond to them as if they were real.'' For decades, all academic talk of coincidence has been in the context of the mathematical. New work by scientists like Joshua B. Tenenbaum, an assistant professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences at M.I.T., is bringing coincidence into the realm of human cognition. Finding connections is not only the way we react to the extraordinary, Tenenbaum postulates, but also the way we make sense of our ordinary world. ''Coincidences are a window into how we learn about things,'' he says. ''They show us how minds derive richly textured knowledge from limited situations.'' To put it another way, our reaction to coincidence shows how our brains fill in the factual blanks. In an optical illusion, he explains, our brain fills the gaps, and although people take it for granted that seeing is believing, optical illusions prove that's not true. ''Illusions also prove that our brain is capable of imposing structure on the world,'' he says. ''One of the things our brain is designed to do is infer the causal structure of the world from limited information.'' If not for this ability, he says, a child could not learn to speak. A child sees a conspiracy, he says, in that others around him are obviously communicating and it is up to the child to decode the method. But these same mechanisms can misfire, he warns. They were well suited to a time of cavemen and tigers and can be overloaded in our highly complex world. ''It's why we have the urge to work everything into one big grand scheme,'' he says. ''We do like to weave things together. ''But have we evolved into fundamentally rational or fundamentally irrational creatures? That is one of the central questions.'' We pride ourselves on being independent and original, and yet our reactions to nearly everything can be plotted along a predictable spectrum. When the grid is coincidences, one end of the scale is for those who believe that these are entertaining events with no meaning; at the other end are those who believe that coincidence is never an accident. The view of coincidence as fate has lately become something of a minitrend in the New Age section of bookstores. Among the more popular authors is SQuire Rushnell (who, in the interest of marketing, spells his first name with a capital Q). Rushnell spent 20 years producing such television programs as ''Good Morning America'' and ''Schoolhouse Rock.'' His fascination with coincidence began when he learned that both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died on the same July 4, 50 years after the ratification of the Declaration of Independence.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ''That stuck in my craw,'' Rushnell says, ''and I couldn't stop wondering what that means.'' And so Rushnell wrote ''When God Winks: How the Power of Coincidence Guides Your Life.'' The book was published by a small press shortly before Sept. 11 and sold well without much publicity. It will be rereleased with great fanfare by Simon & Schuster next month. Its message, Rushnell says, is that ''coincidences are signposts along your universal pathway. They are hints that you are going in the right direction or that you should change course. It's like your grandmother sitting across the Thanksgiving table from you and giving you a wink. What does that wink mean? 'I'm here, I love you, stay the course.'''  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I had to come with her to the movies, she said, because she had made plans with a pal from her office, and he was bringing a friend for me to meet. Translation: I was expected to show up for a last-minute blind date. For some reason, I agreed to go, knocking back a decongestant as I left home. We arrived at the theater to find that the friend who was supposed to be my ''date'' had canceled, but not to worry, another friend had been corralled as a replacement. The replacement and I both fell asleep in the movie (I was sedated by cold medicine; he was a medical resident who had been awake for 36 hours), but four months later we were engaged, and we have been married for nearly 15 years. Rushnell was enthralled by this tale, particularly by the mystical force that seemed to have nudged me out the door when I really wanted to stay home and watch ''The Golden Girls.'' I know that those on the other end of the spectrum -- the scientists and mathematicians -- would have offered several overlapping explanations of why it was unremarkable. There are, of course, the laws of big numbers and small numbers -- the fact that the world is simultaneously so large that anything can happen and so small that weird things seem to happen all the time. Add to that the work of the late Amos Tversky, a giant in the field of coincidence theory, who once described his role in this world as ''debugging human intuition.'' Among other things, Tversky disproved the ''hot hand'' theory of basketball, the belief that a player who has made his last few baskets will more likely than not make his next. After examining thousands of shots by the Philadelphia 76ers, he proved that the odds of a successful shot cannot be predicted by the shots that came before. Tversky similarly proved that arthritis sufferers cannot actually predict the weather and are not in more pain when there's a storm brewing, a belief that began with the ancient Greeks. He followed 18 patients for 15 months, keeping detailed records of their reports of pain and joint swelling and matching them with constantly updated weather reports. There was no pattern, he concluded, though he also conceded that his data would not change many people's beliefs. We believe in such things as hot hands and arthritic forecasting and predestined blind dates because we notice only the winning streaks, only the chance meetings that lead to romance, only the days that Grandma's hands ache before it rains. ''We forget all the times that nothing happens,'' says Ruma Falk, a professor emeritus of psychology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, who studied years ago with Tversky. ''Dreams are another example,'' Falk says. ''We dream a lot. Every night and every morning. But it sometimes happens that the next day something reminds you of that dream. Then you think it was a premonition.'' Falk's work is focused on the question of why we are so entranced by coincidence in the first place. Her research itself began with a coincidence. She was on sabbatical in New York from her native Israel, and on the night before Rosh Hashana she happened to meet a friend from Jerusalem on a Manhattan street corner. She and the friend stood on that corner and marveled at the coincidence. What is the probability of this happening? she remembers wondering. What did this mean? ''How stupid we were,'' Falk says now, ''to be so surprised. We related to all the details that had converged to create that moment. But the real question was what was the probability that at some time in some place I would meet one of my circle of friends? And when I told this story to others at work, they encoded the events as two Israelis meeting in New York, something that happens all the time.'' Why was her experience so resonant for her, Falk asked herself, but not for those around her? One of the many experiments she has conducted since then proceeded as follows: she visited several large university classes, with a total of 200 students, and asked each student to write his or her birth date on a card. She then quietly sorted the cards and found the handful of birthdays that students had in common. Falk wrote those dates on the blackboard. April 10, for instance, Nov. 8, Dec. 16. She then handed out a second card and asked all the students to use a scale to rate how surprised they were by these coincidences.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The cards were numbered, so Falk could determine which answers came from respondents who found their own birth date written on the board. Those in that subgroup were consistently more surprised by the coincidence than the rest of the students. ''It shows the stupid power of personal involvement,'' Falk says. The more personal the event, the more meaning we give it, which is why I am quite taken with my story of meeting my husband (because it is a pivotal moment in my life), and why SQuire Rushnell is also taken with it (because it fits into the theme of his book), but also why Falk is not impressed at all. She likes her own story of the chance meeting on a corner better than my story, while I think her story is a yawn. The fact that personal attachment adds significance to an event is the reason we tend to react so strongly to the coincidences surrounding Sept. 11. In a deep and lasting way, that tragedy feels as if it happened to us all. Falk's findings also shed light on the countless times that pockets of the general public find themselves at odds with authorities and statisticians. Her results might explain, for instance, why lupus patients are certain their breast implants are the reason for their illness, despite the fact that epidemiologists conclude there is no link, or why parents of autistic children are resolute in their belief that childhood immunizations or environmental toxins or a host of other suspected pathogens are the cause, even though experts are skeptical. They might also explain the outrage of all the patients who are certain they live in a cancer cluster, but who have been told otherwise by researchers. Let's be clear: this does not mean that conspiracies do not sometimes exist or that the environment never causes clusters of death. And just as statistics are often used to show us that we should not be surprised, they can also prove what we suspect, that something is wrong out there. ''The fact that so many suspected cancer clusters have turned out to be statistically insupportable does not mean the energy we spent looking for them has been wasted,'' says Dr. James M. Robins, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Harvard and an expert on cancer clusters. ''You're never going to find the real ones if you don't look at all the ones that don't turn out to be real ones.'' Most often, though, coincidence is a sort of Rorschach test. We look into it and find what we already believe. ''It's like an archer shooting an arrow and then drawing a circle around it,'' Falk says. ''We give it meaning because it does mean something -- to us.'' Vladimir Pasechnik was 64 when he died. His early career was spent in the Soviet Union working at Biopreparat, the site of that country's biological weapons program. He defected in 1989 and spilled what he knew to the British, revealing for the first time the immense scale of Soviet work with anthrax, plague, tularemia and smallpox.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For the next 10 years, he worked at the Center for Applied Microbiology and Research, part of Britain's Department of Health. Two years ago, he left to form Regma Biotechnologies, whose goal was to develop treatment for tuberculosis and other infectious disease. In the weeks before he died, Pasechnik had reportedly consulted with authorities about the growing anthrax scare. Despite all these intriguing details, there is nothing to suggest that his death was caused by anything other than a stroke. Robert Schwartz's death, while far more dramatic and bizarre, also appears to have nothing to do with the fact that he was an expert on DNA sequencing and analysis. On Dec. 10 he was found dead on the kitchen floor of his isolated log-and-fieldstone farmhouse near Leesburg, Va., where he had lived alone since losing his wife to cancer four years ago and his children to college. Schwartz had been stabbed to death with a two-foot-long sword, and his killer had carved an X on the back of his neck. Three friends of Schwartz's college-age daughter were soon arrested for what the prosecutor called a ''planned assassination''; two of the trials for first-degree murder are scheduled for this month. A few weeks later, police arrested the daughter as well. One suspect has a history of mental illness, and their written statements to police talk of devil worship and revenge. There is no talk, however, of microbiology. On the same day that Schwartz died, Set Van Nguyen, 44, was found dead in an air-locked storage chamber at the Australian Commonwealth's Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's animal diseases facility in Geelong. A months-long internal investigation concluded that a string of equipment failures had allowed nitrogen to build up in the room, causing Nguyen to suffocate. Although the center itself dealt with microbes like mousepox, which is similar to smallpox, Nguyen himself did not. ''Nguyen was in no way involved in research into mousepox,'' says Stephen Prowse, who was the acting director of the Australian lab during the investigation. ''He was a valued member of the laboratory's technical support staff and not a research scientist.'' Word of all these deaths (though not the specific details) found its way to Ian Gurney, a British writer. Gurney is the author of ''The Cassandra Prophecy: Armageddon Approaches,'' a book that uses clues from the Bible to calculate that Judgment Day will occur in or about the year 2023. He is currently researching his second book, which is in part about the threat of nuclear and biological weapons, and after Sept. 11 he entered a news alert request into Yahoo, asking to be notified whenever there was news with the key word ''microbiologist.'' First Que, then Wiley, then Pasechnik, Schwartz and Nguyen popped up on Gurney's computer. ''I'm not a conspiracy theorist,'' says the man who has predicted the end of the world, ''but it certainly did look suspicious.'' Gurney compiled what he had learned from these scattered accounts into an article that he sent to a number of Web sites, including Rense.com, which tracks U.F.O. sightings worldwide. ''Over the past few weeks,'' Gurney wrote, ''several world-acclaimed scientific researchers specializing in infectious diseases and biological agents such as anthrax, as well as DNA sequencing, have been found dead or have gone missing.'' The article went on to call Benito Que, the cancer lab technician, ''a cell biologist working on infectious diseases like H.I.V.,'' and said that he had been attacked by four men with a baseball bat but did not mention that he suffered from high blood pressure. It then described the disappearance of Wiley without mentioning his seizure disorder and the death of Pasechnik without saying that he had suffered a stroke. It gave the grisly details of Schwartz's murder, but said nothing of the arrests of his daughter's friends. Nguyen, in turn, was described as ''a skilled microbiologist,'' and it was noted that he shared a last name with Kathy Nguyen, the 61-year-old hospital worker who just happened to be the one New Yorker to die of anthrax.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Of course, there have always been rumors based on skewed historical fact. Recall, for example, the list of coincidences that supposedly linked the deaths of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. It goes, in part, like this: The two men were elected 100 years apart; their assassins were born 100 years apart (in fact, 101 years apart); they were both succeeded by men named Johnson; and the two Johnsons were born 100 years apart. Their names each contain seven letters; their successors' names each contain 13 letters; and their assassins' names each contain 15 letters. Lincoln was shot in a theater and his assassin ran to a warehouse, while Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assassin ran to a theater. Lincoln, or so the story goes, had a secretary named Kennedy who warned him not to go to the theater the night he was killed (for the record, Lincoln's White House secretaries were named John Nicolay and John Hay, and Lincoln regularly rejected warnings not to attend public events out of fear for his safety, including his own inauguration); Kennedy, in turn, had a secretary named Lincoln (true, Evelyn Lincoln) who warned him not to go to Dallas (he, too, was regularly warned not to go places, including San Antonio the day before his trip to Dallas). I first read about these connections five years after the Kennedy assassination, when I was 8, which says something about how conspiracy theory speaks to the child in all of us. But it also says something about the technology of the time. The numerological coincidences from the World Trade Center that I mentioned at the start of this article made their way onto my computer screen by Sept. 15, from a friend of a friend of a friend of an acquaintance, ad infinitum and ad nauseam. Professor Robins of Harvard points out that ''the Web has changed the scale of these things.'' Had there been a string of dead scientists back in 1992 rather than 2002, he says, it is possible that no one would have ever known. ''Back then, you would not have had the technical ability to gather all these bits and pieces of information, while today you'd be able to pull it off. It's well known that if you take a lot of random noise, you can find chance patterns in it, and the Net makes it easier to collect random noise.'' The Gurney article traveled from one Web site to the next and caught the attention of Paul Sieveking, a co-editor of Fortean Times, a magazine that describes itself as ''the Journal of Strange Phenomena.'' ''People send me stuff all the time,'' Sieveking says. ''This was really interesting.'' Wearing his second hat as a columnist for the The Sunday Telegraph in London, he wrote a column on the subject for that paper titled ''Strange but True -- The Deadly Curse of the Bioresearchers.'' His version began with the link between the two Nguyens and concluded, ''It is possible that nothing connects this string of events, but . . . it offers ample fodder for the conspiracy theorist or thriller writer.'' Commenting on the story months later, Sieveking says: ''It's probably just a random clumping, but it just happens to look significant. We're all natural storytellers, and conspiracy theorists are just frustrated novelists. We like to make up a good story out of random facts.'' Over the months, Gurney added names to his list and continued to send it to virtual and actual publications around the U.S. Mainstream newspapers started taking up the story, including an alternative weekly in Memphis, where interest in the Wiley case was particularly strong, and most recently The Toronto Globe and Mail. The tally of ''microbiologists'' is now at 11, give or take, depending on the story you read. In addition to the men already discussed, the names that appear most often are these: Victor Korshunov, a Russian expert in intestinal bacteria, who was bashed over the head near his home in Moscow; Ian Langford, a British expert in environmental risk and disease, who was found dead in his home near Norwich, England, naked from the waist down and wedged under a chair; Tanya Holzmayer, who worked as a microbiologist near San Jose and was shot seven times by a former colleague when she opened the door to a pizza delivery man; David Wynn-Williams, who studied microbes in the Antarctic and was hit by a car while jogging near his home in Cambridge, England; and Steven Mostow, an expert in influenza, who died when the plane he was piloting crashed near Denver. The stories have also made their way into the e-mail in-boxes of countless microbiologists. Janet Shoemaker, director of public and scientific affairs for the American Society for Microbiology, heard the tales and points out that her organization alone has 41,000 members, meaning that the deaths of 11 worldwide, most of whom were not technically microbiologists at all, is not statistically surprising. ''We're saddened by anyone's death,'' she says. ''But this is just a coincidence. In another political climate I don't think anyone would have noticed.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ken Alibek heard them, too, and dismissed them. Alibek is one of the country's best-known microbiologists. He was the No. 2 man at Biopreparrat (where Victor Pasechnik also worked) before he defected and now works with the U.S. government seeking antidotes for the very weapons he developed. Those who have died, he says, did not really know anything about biological weapons, and if there were a conspiracy to kill scientists with such knowledge, he would be dead. ''I considered all this a little artificial, because a number of them couldn't have been considered B.W. experts,'' he says with a hint of disdain. ''I got an e-mail from Pasechnik before he died, and he was working on a field completely different from this. People say to me, 'Ken, you could be a target,' but if you start thinking about this, then your life is over. I'm not saying I'm not worried, but I'm not paying much attention. I'm opening my mail as usual. If I see something suspicious, I know what to do.'' Others are not quite as sanguine. Phyllis Della-Latta is the director of clinical microbiology services at New York's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. She found an article on the deaths circulating in the most erudite place -- an Internet discussion group of directors of clinical microbiology labs around the world. These are the people who, when a patient develops suspicious symptoms, are brought in to rule out things like anthrax. Della-Latta, whom I know from past medical reporting, forwarded the article to me with a note: ''See attached. FYI. Should I be concerned??? I'm off on a business trip to Italy tomorrow & next week. If I don't return, write my obituary.'' She now says she doesn't really believe there is any connection between the deaths. ''It's probably only coincidence,'' she says, then adds: ''But if we traced back a lot of things that we once dismissed as coincidence -- foreigners taking flying lessons -- we would have found they weren't coincidence at all. You become paranoid. You have to be.'' Don Wiley's body was finally found on Dec. 20, near Vidalia, La., about 300 miles south of where he disappeared. The Memphis medical examiner, O.C. Smith, concluded that yellow paint marks on Wiley's car suggest that he hit a construction sign on the Hernando DeSoto Bridge, as does the fact that a hubcap was missing from the right front tire. Smith's theory is that heavy truck traffic on the bridge can set off wind gusts and create ''roadway bounce,'' which might have been enough to cause Wiley to lose his balance after getting out of the car to inspect the scrapes. He was 6-foot-3, and the bridge railing would have only come up to mid-thigh. ''If Dr. Wiley were on the curb trying to assess damage to his car, all of these factors may have played a role in his going over the rail,'' Smith said when he issued his report. Bone fractures found on the body support this theory. Wiley suffered fractures to his neck and spine, and his chest was crushed, injuries that are consistent with Wiley's hitting a support beam before he landed in the water. The Wiley family considers this case closed. ''These kinds of theories are something that's always there,'' says Wiley's wife, Katrin Valgeirsdottir, who has heard all the rumors. ''People who want to believe it will believe it, and there's nothing anyone can say.''   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Memphis Police also consider the case closed, and the local office of the F.B.I. has turned its attention to other odd happenings. The talk of Memphis at the moment is the bizarre ambush of the city's coroner last month. He was wrapped in barbed wire and left lying in a stairwell of the medical examiner's building with a live bomb strapped to his chest. Coincidentally, that coroner, O.C. Smith, was also the coroner who did the much-awaited, somewhat controversial autopsy on Don Wiley. What are the odds of that? The numbers 9/11 (9 plus 1 plus 1) equal 11, and American Airlines Flight 11 was the first to hit the twin towers, and there were 92 people on board (9 plus 2), and Sept. 11 is the 254th day of the year (2 plus 5 plus 4).; What of the deaths of nearly a dozen scientists? Is it really possible that they all just happened to die, most in such jarring ways, within so short a time?; The fact that personal attachment adds significance to an event is the reason we tend to react so strongly to the coincidences surrounding Sept. 11. In a deep and lasting way, that tragedy feels as if it happened to us all.; Presidents Kennedy and Lincoln were elected 100 years apart. Both men were succeeded by Johnsons, who were also born 100 years apart. Their names each contain seven letters. Their successors' names each contain 13 letters. Their assassins's names each contain 15 letters.; In a room of 23 people, the odds are even that two of them will have the same birthday. Reduce the occupants to 14, and it's even money that two of them were born within one day of each other. And for a 50-50 chance of finding a pair with birthdays a week apart, you need to invite only seven to the party.   Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer for the magazine.

Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details. (March 2016)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Odds are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics . In statistics, the odds for or odds of some event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while odds against reflect the likelihood that it will not. In gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event. [1] [2] Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event.  In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. [3] Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker ) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. In simplest terms, 6 to 1 odds means if you bet a dollar (the "1" in the expression), and you win you get paid six dollars (the "6" in the expression), or 6 x 1. If you bet two dollars you would be paid twelve dollars, or 6 x 2. If you bet three dollars and win, you would be paid eighteen dollars, or 6 x 3. If you bet one hundred dollars and win you would be paid six hundred dollars, or 6 x 100. If you lose any of those bets you would lose the dollar, or two dollars, or three dollars, or one hundred dollars.  In statistics, the odds for an event E are defined as a simple function of the probability of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the uncertainty of this possible event as odds for is that to regain the probability requires a calculation. The natural way to interpret odds for (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) odds for rolling six with a fair die (one of a pair of dice ) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 six event for every 5 times the die does not show six. For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 sixes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) odds against, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the odds against rolling a six with a fair die are 5 to 1. The probability of rolling a six with a fair die is the single number 1/6, roughly 0.17.  The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a six will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a six and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a six, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a six and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no advantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. Casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the United States. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.

[4] Shakespeare wrote:   Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one  — William Shakespeare , Henry IV, Part II , Act I, Scene 1 lines 181–2.   The sixteenth century polymath Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes [5] ).  Terminology [ edit ]  Odds are expressed in the form X to Y, where X and Y are numbers. Usually, the word "to" is replaced by a symbol for ease of use. This is conventionally either a slash or hyphen , although a colon is sometimes seen. Thus, 6/1, 6-1 and 6:1 are all interchangeable.  Odds against [ edit ]  When the probability that the event will not happen is greater than the probability that it will, then the odds are "against" that event happening. Odds of 6 to 1, for example, are therefore sometimes said to be "6 to 1 against ". To a gambler, "odds against" means that the amount he or she will win is greater than the amount staked.  Odds on [ edit ]  "Odds on" is the opposite of "odds against". It means that the event is more likely to happen than not. This is sometimes expressed with the smaller number first (1 to 2) but more often using the word "on" ("2 to 1 on ") meaning that the event is twice as likely to happen as not. Note that the gambler who bets at "odds on" and wins will still be in profit, as his stake will be returned. For example, on a $2 bet, the gambler will be given $1 plus the returned stake of $2, yielding a $1 profit.  Even odds [ edit ]  Main article: Even money  "Even odds" occur when the probability of an event happening is exactly the same as it not happening. In common parlance, this is a "50-50 chance". Guessing heads or tails on a coin toss is the classic example of an event that has even odds. In gambling, it is commonly referred to as " even money " or simply "evens" (1 to 1, or 2 for 1). "Evens" implies that the payout will be one unit per unit wagered plus the original stake, that is, "double-your-money".  Better than/worse than evens [ edit ]  The term "better than evens" (or "worse than evens") varies in meaning depending on context. Looked at from the perspective of a gambler rather than a statistician, "better than evens" means "odds against". If the odds are evens (1:1), and one bets 10 units, one would be returned 20 units, making a profit of 10 units. If the gamble was paying 4:1 and the event occurred, one would make 50 units, or a profit of 40 units. So, it is "better than evens" from the gambler's perspective because it pays out more than one-for-one. If an event is more likely to occur than an even chance, then the odds will be "worse than evens", and the bookmaker will pay out less than one-for-one.  However, in popular parlance surrounding uncertain events, the expression "better than evens" usually implies a greater than 50% chance of the event occurring, which is exactly the opposite of the meaning of the expression when used in a gaming context.  Statistical usage [ edit ]  In statistics, odds are an expression of relative probabilities, generally quoted as the odds in favor . The odds (in favor) of an event or a proposition is the ratio of the probability that the event will happen to the probability that the event will not happen. Mathematically, this is a Bernoulli trial , as it has exactly two outcomes. In case of a finite sample space of equally likely outcomes , this is the ratio of the number of outcomes where the event occurs to the number of outcomes where the event does not occur; these can be represented as W and L (for Wins and Losses) or S and F (for Success and Failure). For example, the odds that a randomly chosen day of the week is a weekend are two to five (2:5), as days of the week form a sample space of seven outcomes, and the event occurs for two of the outcomes (Saturday and Sunday), and not for the other five. [6] [7] Conversely, given odds as a ratio of integers, this can be represented by a probability space of a finite number of equally likely outcomes. These definitions are equivalent, since dividing both terms in the ratio by the number of outcomes yields the probabilities:     2  :  5  =  (  2   /   7  )  :  (  5   /   7  )  .    {\displaystyle 2:5=(2/7):(5/7).}   Conversely, the odds against is the opposite ratio. For example, the odds against a random day of the week being a weekend are 5:2.  Odds and probability can be expressed in prose via the prepositions to and in: "odds of so many to so many on (or against) [some event]" refers to odds – the ratio of numbers of (equally likely) outcomes in favor and against (or vice versa); "chances of so many [outcomes], in so many [outcomes]" refers to probability – the number of (equally like) outcomes in favour relative to the number for and against combined. For example, "odds of a weekend are 2 to 5", while "chances of a weekend are 2 in 7". In casual use, the words odds and chances (or chance ) are often used interchangeably to vaguely indicate some measure of odds or probability, though the intended meaning can be deduced by noting whether the preposition between the two numbers is to or in . [8] [9] [10]  Mathematical relations [ edit ]  Odds can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, in which case it is not unique – scaling both terms by the same factor does not change the proportions: 1:1 odds and 100:100 odds are the same (even odds). Odds can also be expressed as a number, by dividing the terms in the ratio – in this case it is unique (different fractions can represent the same rational number ). Odds as a ratio, odds as a number, and probability (also a number) are related by simple formulas, and similarly odds in favor and odds against, and probability of success and probability of failure have simple relations. Odds range from 0 to infinity, while probabilities range from 0 to 1, and hence are often represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%: reversing the ratio switches odds for with odds against, and similarly probability of success with probability of failure.  Given odds (in favor) as the ratio W:L (Wins:Losses), the odds in favor (as a number)      o   f      {\displaystyle o_{f}}   and odds against (as a number)      o   a      {\displaystyle o_{a}}   can be computed by simply dividing, and are multiplicative inverses :            o   f       =  W   /   L  =  1   /    o   a         o   a       =  L   /   W  =  1   /    o   f         o   f    ⋅   o   a       =  1        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}o_{f}&=W/L=1/o_{a}\\o_{a}&=L/W=1/o_{f}\\o_{f}\cdot o_{a}&=1\end{aligned}}}     Analogously, given odds as a ratio, the probability of success or failure can be computed by dividing, and the probability of success and probability of failure sum to unity (one), as they are the only possible outcomes. In case of a finite number of equally likely outcomes, this can be interpreted as the number of outcomes where the event occurs divided by the total number of events:           p     =  W   /   (  W  +  L  )  =  1  −  q      q     =  L   /   (  W  +  L  )  =  1  −  p      p  +  q     =  1        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=W/(W+L)=1-q\\q&=L/(W+L)=1-p\\p+q&=1\end{aligned}}}     Given a probability p, the odds as a ratio is     p  :  q    {\displaystyle p:q}   (probability of success to probability of failure), and the odds as numbers can be computed by dividing:            o   f       =  p   /   q  =  p   /   (  1  −  p  )  =  (  1  −  q  )   /   q       o   a       =  q   /   p  =  (  1  −  p  )   /   p  =  q   /   (  1  −  q  )        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}o_{f}&=p/q=p/(1-p)=(1-q)/q\\o_{a}&=q/p=(1-p)/p=q/(1-q)\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, given the odds as a number      o   f    ,    {\displaystyle o_{f},}   this can be represented as the ratio      o   f    :  1  ,    {\displaystyle o_{f}:1,}   or conversely     1  :  (  1   /    o   f    )  =  1  :   o   a    ,    {\displaystyle 1:(1/o_{f})=1:o_{a},}   from which the probability of success or failure can be computed:           p     =   o   f     /   (   o   f    +  1  )  =  1   /   (   o   a    +  1  )      q     =   o   a     /   (   o   a    +  1  )  =  1   /   (   o   f    +  1  )        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=o_{f}/(o_{f}+1)=1/(o_{a}+1)\\q&=o_{a}/(o_{a}+1)=1/(o_{f}+1)\end{aligned}}}     Thus if expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1, probability and odds differ by exactly 1 in the denominator: a probability of 1 in 100 (1/100 = 1%) is the same as odds of 1 to 99 (1/99 = 0.0101… = 0. 01 ), while odds of 1 to 100 (1/100 = 0.01) is the same as a probability of 1 in 101 (1/101 = 0.00990099… = 0. 0099 ). This is a minor difference if the probability is small (close to zero, or "long odds"), but is a major difference if the probability is large (close to one).  These are worked out for some simple odds:    odds (ratio)       o   f      {\displaystyle o_{f}}         o   a      {\displaystyle o_{a}}        p    {\displaystyle p}        q    {\displaystyle q}      1:1  1  1  50%  50%    0:1  0  ∞  0%  100%    1:0  ∞  0  100%  0%    2:1  2  0.5  67%  33%    1:2  0.5  2  33%  67%    4:1  4  0.25  80%  20%    1:4  0.25  4  20%  80%       9:1  9  0. 1  90%  10%    10:1  10  0.1  90. 90 %  9. 09 %    99:1  99  0. 01  99%  1%    100:1  100  0.01  99. 0099 %  0. 90 %    These transforms have certain special geometric properties: the conversions between odds for and odds against (resp. probability of success with probability of failure) and between odds and probability are all Möbius transformations (fractional linear transformations). They are thus specified by three points ( sharply 3-transitive ). Swapping odds for and odds against swaps 0 and infinity, fixing 1, while swapping probability of success with probability of failure swaps 0 and 1, fixing .5; these are both order 2, hence circular transforms . Converting odds to probability fixes 0, sends infinity to 1, and sends 1 to .5 (even odds are 50% likely), and conversely; this is a parabolic transform .  Applications [ edit ]  In probability theory and Bayesian statistics , odds may sometimes be more natural or more convenient than probabilities. This is often the case in problems of sequential decision making as for instance in problems of how to stop (online) on a last specific event which is solved by the odds algorithm . Similar ratios are used elsewhere in Bayesian statistics, such as the Bayes factor .  The odds are a ratio of probabilities; an odds ratio is a ratio of odds, that is, a ratio of ratios of probabilities. Odds-ratios are often used in analysis of clinical trials . While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter- intuitive results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is four times more likely to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the odds are 16 times higher on the less likely event (4–1 against , or 4) than on the more likely one (1–4, or 4–1 on , or 0.25).  In some cases the log-odds are used, which is the logit of the probability. Most simply, odds are frequently multiplied or divided, and log converts multiplication to addition and division to subtractions.   Example #1  There are 5 pink marbles, 2 blue marbles, and 8 purple marbles. What are the odds in favor of picking a blue marble?   Answer: The odds in favour of a blue marble are 2:13. One can equivalently say, that the odds are 13:2 against . There are 2 out of 15 chances in favour of blue, 13 out of 15 against blue.  In probability theory and statistics , where the variable p is the probability in favor of a binary event, and the probability against the event is therefore 1- p , "the odds" of the event are the quotient of the two, or       p   1  −  p       {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{1-p}}}   . That value may be regarded as the relative probability the event will happen, expressed as a fraction (if it is less than 1), or a multiple (if it is equal to or greater than one) of the likelihood that the event will not happen.  In the very first example at top, saying the odds of a Sunday are "one to six" or, less commonly, "one-sixth" means the probability of picking a Sunday randomly is one-sixth the probability of not picking a Sunday. While the mathematical probability of an event has a value in the range from zero to one, "the odds" in favor of that same event lie between zero and infinity. The odds against the event with probability given as p are        1  −  p   p      {\displaystyle {\frac {1-p}{p}}}   . The odds against Sunday are 6:1 or  6/1 = 6. It is 6 times as likely that a random day is not a Sunday.   Example #2  There are 5 red marbles, 2 green marbles, and 8 yellow marbles. What are the odds against picking a yellow marble?   Answer: 7:8  Gambling usage [ edit ]  The use of odds in gambling facilitates betting on events where the relative probabilities of outcomes varied. For example, on a coin toss or a match race between two evenly matched horses, it is reasonable for two people to wager level stakes. However, in more variable situations, such as a multi-runner horse race or a football match between two unequally matched sides, betting "at odds" provides a perspective on the relative likelihoods of the possible outcomes.  In the modern era, most fixed odds betting takes place between a betting organisation, such as a bookmaker , and an individual, rather than between individuals. Different traditions have grown up in how to express odds to customers, older eras came with betting odds between people, today which is illegal in most countries, it was referred as "odding", an underground slang word with origins based in the Bronx.  Fractional odds [ edit ]  Favoured by bookmakers in the United Kingdom and Ireland , and also common in horse racing , fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the bettor, should he or she win, relative to the stake. [11] Odds of 4/1 would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake. If the odds are 1/4, the bettor will make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, having won, the bettor always receives the original stake back; so if the odds are 4/1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as evens or even money .  The numerator and denominator of fractional odds are always integers , thus if the bookmaker's payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator . For example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.  Fractional odds are also known as British odds,  UK odds, [12] or, in that country, traditional odds . They are typically represented with a "/" but can also be represented with a "-", e.g. 4/1 or 4-1. Odds with a denominator of 1 are often presented in listings as the numerator only. [ citation needed ]  A variation of fractional odds is known as Hong Kong odds. Fractional and Hong Kong odds are actually exchangeable. The only difference is that the UK odds are presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong odds are decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.  The European odds also represent the potential winnings (net returns), but in addition they factor in the stake (e.g. 6/5 or 1.2 plus 1 = 2.2). [13]  Decimal odds [ edit ]  Favoured in continental Europe , Australia , New Zealand and Canada , decimal odds quote the ratio of the payout amount, including the original stake, to the stake itself. [14] Decimal odds are generally considered the easiest to deal with as they reflect the inverse of the probability of an outcome. [15] Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one. [16] Thus even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2.00. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5.00, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. This is considered to be ideal for parlay betting, because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on. Decimal odds are also favoured by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading.  Decimal odds are also known as European odds , digital odds or continental odds. [12]  Moneyline odds [ edit ]  Main article: moneyline odds  Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. The figure quoted is either positive or negative.   When moneyline odds are positive, the figure indicates how much money will be won on a $100 wager (this is done for an outcome that is considered less likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 4/1 would be quoted as +400.  When moneyline odds are negative, the figure indicates how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done for an outcome is considered more likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 1/4 would be quoted as -400.   Moneyline odds are often referred to as American odds . A "Moneyline" wager refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread . In most cases, the favorite will have negative moneyline odds (less payoff for a safer bet) and the underdog will have positive moneyline odds (more payoff for a risky bet). However, if the teams are evenly matched, both teams can have a negative line at the same time (e.g. -110 -110 or -105 -115), due to house take.  Gambling odds versus probabilities [ edit ]  Main article: Mathematics of bookmaking  In gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the bookmaker will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. In formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful bettor is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. This profit is known as the 'over-round' on the 'book' (the 'book' refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term 'bookmaker') and relates to the sum of the 'odds' in the following way:  In a 3-horse race, for example, the true probabilities of each of the horses winning based on their relative abilities may be 50%, 40% and 10%. The total of these three percentages is 100%, thus representing a fair 'book'. The true odds against winning for each of the three horses are 1-1, 3-2 and 9-1 respectively.  In order to generate a profit on the wagers accepted, the bookmaker may decide to increase the values to 60%, 50% and 20% for the three horses, respectively. This represents the odds against each, which are 4-6, 1-1 and 4-1, in order. These values now total 130%, meaning that the book has an overround of 30 (130−100). This value of 30 represents the amount of profit for the bookmaker if he gets bets in good proportions on each of the horses. For example, if he takes £60, £50, and £20 of stakes respectively for the three horses, he receives £130 in wagers but only pays £100 back (including stakes), whichever horse wins. And the expected value of his profit is positive even if everybody bets on the same horse. The art of bookmaking is in setting the odds low enough so as to have a positive expected value of profit while keeping the odds high enough to attract customers, and at the same time attracting enough bets for each outcome to reduce his risk exposure.  A study on soccer betting found that the probability for the home team to win was generally about 3.4% less than the value calculated from the odds (for example, 46.6% for even odds). It was about 3.7% less for wins by the visitors, and 5.7% less for draws. [17]  Making a profit in gambling involves predicting the relationship of the true probabilities to the payout odds. Sports information services are often used by professional and semi-professional sports bettors to help achieve this goal.  The odds or amounts the bookmaker will pay are determined by the total amount that has been bet on all of the possible events. They reflect the balance of wagers on either side of the event, and include the deduction of a bookmaker's brokerage fee ("vig" or vigorish ).  Also, depending on how the betting is affected by jurisdiction, taxes may be involved for the bookmaker and/or the winning player. This may be taken into account when offering the odds and/or may reduce the amount won by a player.
