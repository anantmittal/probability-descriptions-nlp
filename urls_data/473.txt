You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

According to conventional wisdom, twins not only run in families, but they also — for some strange reason — always skip at least one generation. It is a claim that is widely repeated, but only partly true.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    Scientists have known for some time that there is a gene that can predispose women to hyperovulation, or releasing two or more eggs in a single menstrual cycle. When both eggs are fertilized, the resulting siblings are fraternal twins.  Because this gene can be passed on, the tendency to have fraternal twins can in fact run in families. Identical twins, on the other hand, result from one fertilized egg randomly splitting in two, creating two siblings with identical DNA. Because there is no known gene that influences this process, it is considered a mere coincidence when one extended family has multiple sets of identical twins. The notion that twins always skip a generation is also a myth. The illusion may have arisen because men who inherit the gene from their mothers are unaffected by it ( they do not ovulate), but can still pass it on to their daughters, who, in turn, will have an increased likelihood of conceiving twins. THE BOTTOM LINE Twins can run in families, but do not necessarily bypass generations.   scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: Twins always skip a generation.

Twins are defined as two offspring born together, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are born on the same date. Multiples are generally born only a few minutes apart. If delivered by cesarian section , the interval between births is usually only a minute, maybe two. The interval is generally longer for vaginal deliveries, ranging from a few minutes to more than an hour.         In modern times, if the time period extends much beyond that, doctors elect to perform a C-section for the second baby, fearing distress or the risk of infection. However, some studies make a case against this practice. There are exceptions to the rule that twins have the same birthday. Some are due to a delivery near midnight, while others may extend to longer intervals due to medical intervention delaying the interval of births. Delayed Interval Births In some cases, a delayed interval birth takes place when one multiple is delivered prematurely, but doctors are able to halt labor and keep the remaining multiple(s) in their mother's womb to grow and develop. Some of these multiples—twins, triplets or more—were born days, weeks or even months apart. These are rare events. Twins Born on Either Side of Midnight The difference between today and tomorrow is literally a matter of seconds. Plenty of babies are delivered in the middle of the night.   Babies that are born close to midnight may arrive on different days. For example, Twin A may be born at 11:59 pm on one day while Twin B doesn't make an appearance until 12:01 am, which would be the next day. This can create some interesting dilemmas. For example, two British twins were born either side of midnight on August 31 and September 1.         Unfortunately, September 1 is the cut-off date for starting school in their area, so only the first-born twin would turn 5 in time for the start of kindergarten. The father, a twin himself, said he would do everything possible to ensure they both were in the same grade at school. The difference in the month would also matter for when they were due for immunizations, even though there were born only minutes apart. While common sense may rule, sometimes there are strict date cutoffs encoded in law that would require petitioning for an exception. Twins Born in Different Years, Decades, and Millennia There are cases of twins born in different years. In Texas, twins were born only one minute apart, but in different years, delivered by C-section as the last baby of 2013 and the first baby of 2014.  A similar situation occurred as 2015 changed to 2016 in San Diego with fraternal twins. Twins can be born in different decades, as happened as 2009 changed to 2010 and a pair of Florida twins came into the world on each side of the dividing line. To top it all, there are twins born in different millennia. Twins were born in Massachusetts only eight minutes apart, but they were born in proximity to the turn of the millennium in 2000.         One boy arrived on New Year's Eve, 1999, just a few minutes shy of midnight. And in the first few seconds of the year 2000, his twin brother took his first breath. In these cases, there can be ongoing implications for eligibility for programs and services as well as tax deductions. The parents would have to advocate for including both twins the year the first was eligible or delaying until both were eligible, if possible. Source: Porreco RP, Farkouh LJ.

By Stephanie / 5						COMMENTS  111 Shares    Most moms consider themselves lucky enough to have one set of twins, but if you’re incredibly lucky, then you might even end up with two pairs of twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice?    What are the chances of having twins? The birth rate for twins is only going up, rising by as much as 76% in the last 30 years. That means that your chance of having twins in the USA is as high as 3 in 100 births. But that’s fraternal twins. The chance of identical twins is the same as it’s always been, which is around 3 in 1000 babies born as identical twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice? Obviously, the chance of having two sets of twins is pretty rare, but it’s not as rare as you might think. If you’re looking for two sets of twins of any type, the chance of that is around 1 in 3,000, which is the same chance as getting struck by lightning during your life!   A set of identical twins and fraternal twins is only around 1 in 10,000, or the same odds that you’re going to fall off your toilet and end up in hospital! Having two sets of identical twins is pretty damn unlikely, with only 1 chance in 70,000. Bear in mind that if you’ve already got one set of twins, you might actually be more likely to have a second set, because of all of the things that increase your chances of twin births. Things like: Having already been pregnant before. Women who have already had a baby, including women who have already had twins, are more likely to have twins in the future! Getting older. Women over the age of around 35 have more twins in general, because in the few years before you hit peri-menopause, your ovaries start to release more than one egg at a time. Having some sort of fertility treatment, like IVF or fertility drugs. These sort of things can stimulate your body to produce multiple eggs over and over. Coming from a family with twins in it. There’s some sort of genetic component to twins, and if twins run in your family, then you’re more likely to have them. This also means that if you’ve had twins once, they might run in your family and you might have them again! Being on the pill, or just coming off of the pill. Apparently, the hormonal changes that the pill causes in women can increase their chances of having twins. Being taller or heavier than average. Taller and heavier women have a greater than normal chance of having twins . But remember to stay healthy! Make sure your partner has a lot of zinc in his diet. Zinc contributes to healthy sperm, and the healthier your partner’s sperm, the more you have of chance of conceiving twins! Twins are getting more and more common, so if you have one set of twins and you’re going for another, you might just get lucky! How do you think you would cope with two sets of twins? Do you know anyone who actually has two sets of twins? Or maybe you’re one of the incredibly fortunate women who beat the odds and has an awesome foursome! Let us know in the comments below!        Nicole  says: October 25, 2017 at 10:20 pm I actually know 2 people within 30 mins of each other who have 2 pairs of twins! Reply   Deidre Turner  says: November 17, 2017 at 5:01 am Me! I’m 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins (both di/di). My first set were conceived with the assistance of fertility treatment (IUI), then I had a singleton conceived naturally and I’m pregnant with twins again, conceived naturally this time. I’m not particularly tall or big, I’m under 35 (currently 34 and was 29 having my first set), I haven’t been on the pill for years and hubby’s sperm counts are ok but not great. I’ve only been pregnant 3 times. I was on only 25mg (half a tablet) of clomid for 4 cycles over 5 years ago so that’s all the fertility drugs I ever took. It explains the first set but not the second set. I think that family history is my biggest influence; my nanna had 2 sets of twins and a set of triplets; my mum is one of the triplets. I’m the only one in my large extended family who has had any multiples at all so it looks like the twin gene skipped straight to me! Reply   Katie Hopkins  says: February 28, 2018 at 7:51 am I’m 24 years old and pregnant with my second set of twins. No fertility treatments or help . My first set of twins are boy/ girl fraternal twins . And are turning a year old in a month. My current pregnancy are identical boy (mo/di) twins. They will be here in June or before. So I got one set of each , not on purpose , but definitely blessed. Reply   Sammie  says: March 15, 2018 at 5:52 am I am currently 28, and 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins. Fraternal twins boy/girl set.  My first set of twins are fraternal twin girls they are four now. Never thought this would happen to me. I am not overweight, not y’all only 5’1 and am under 35. So this just shows that it can happen to anyone. Both sets conceived naturally. Only been pregnant twice, so I guess I can help honestly say I’ve been blessed . Good luck to you all. Reply   Stacey  says: March 22, 2018 at 6:01 pm I’m 12 weeks pregnant with my second set of mo/di (identical) twins. I have identical boys who just turned 4. Never thought in a million years we’d have 2 sets of twins. I’m 34, no fertility treatments, no family/genetic history of twins. Just blessed!

But, when reading the below, keep in mind that Michelle Duggar who has 18 children, only has 2 sets of twins!  Here's some good information:  Factors that Influence Twins Twins can occur naturally in any woman at any time. However, there are certain factors that increase your chances of having twins. These factors include:     Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably.    Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins.    Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. Women produce more ovulation-stimulating hormone as they age, increasing your chance of releasing more than one egg during ovulation. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39.    Previous Twins: If you’ve already had twins, it is more likely that you will have another twin pregnancy.    Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.    Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, women can increase their chances of having twins up to 20%.    Weight Gain : A study by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology linked the recent rise in multiple births with the steady rise of obesity in North America. Women with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 are more likely to have twins than those in the suggested BMI range of 19 to 25.     --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     j_l_badders    Posted 02/06/2009      I heard its more likely with fraternal than identicalsince fraternal is about releasing more than one egg and identical is a by chance thing with the egg splitting but I read somewhere (have no clue where now) while I was pregnant that its more than a 50% after fraternal but that doesn't seem likely???I do however know a 2x twin mom so yeah it happens.

But again, the chances are not 50% like some people think...again, Michelle Duggar has only had 2 sets of twins among her 18 children, and they were pretty far apart with several singletons in between.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     tazzersize2000 · Original Poster    Posted 02/06/2009      wow!  a co-worker at my old job had one kid then had a set of twins!!???mommytotwingirls do you plan on having any other children?

I heard from someone you can do a test to see if you ovulate two eggs every time.  If that is that case you can always do IVF  (in vitro fertilization) and put in one egg.  A friend of a friend wants to do this because her twins were born very early because of a problem she has and does not want to risk having another set of twins and losing them both.    --  JAM DS 1/2005 , DD 12/2006 Twins!

What are the chances of having twins twice?             aidasanchez26    Posted 08/12/2017       I have 16 month old twin boys. I wasn't ovulating at the time my DH  (dear husband) & I were tttc. So I started to take Vitex (a natural supplement to help you ovulate) within 3 wks of taking it O  (ovulation) became pregnant with the twins. I should also mention that I was taking twice the dosage recommended on the bottle as I was so desperate to become pregnant. I feel that caused spontaneous ovulation & I became pregnant with twins. We are thinking of trying again but are scared to become pregnant again with twins. I wouldn't take Vitex or any other supplement this time around, I would try naturally. I just turned 34 on July. Has anyone become pregnant with a singleton naturally after having twins?

But plenty of people have additional sets of twins too. I'd say go for it, but not til you're prepared for the possibility of twins again.

Overall though, it's about 1:11.  Think of Michelle Duggar.  She's had at least 21 pregnancies (that we know of) and in that, only 2 sets of fraternal twins, so she fits right in with the approx. 1:11 odds.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB             Reply            Report this comment       0                    TafadzwaJC    Posted 08/16/2017      I have a similar situation for me this time around I got pregnant naturally and my twin boys are only 18months old so am waiting to get my ultrasound and am nervous, scared, excited, anxious &all.....that I can have multiples again considering that twins run in my family, my mum had twins though they passed away and lots of my cousins have twins.

Really though, I can't imagine it any other way. We've thought about if we have 'another' what if it is only one? How lonely would s/he be with 4 big sisters who are all best friends? Would we have another after that? What if the 'other' was also twins?

Although our identical girls didn't make it - I still consider myself to have had 2 sets.Â  both have been confirmed identical.Â  again the chances are super rare.Â  I've met a few people who've had a couple sets of fraternal though.    --  Married to DH 5/1/04 - DD  3/13/08 - twin angel baby girls born at 19.5 weeks 6/15/10 R a i n b o w twin BOYS 4/10/11!

Â My first set were 3 in April and I am due with this set in September. Â There is a woman who goes to the same perinatal center as me that has 3 sets of identicals (I don't know the sexes), someone who goes to the same pool as me with 2 sets of identical girls and someone else I met said they were the 3rd set of identicals their mom was pregnant with (and the only survivors). Â  There has been new research in the past few years on identical twins that shows it is not as random as they thought...it is genetic. Â But it is a combination of the parents.

If they were identical that doesn't increase your chances any more than any other woman, unfortunately, since they're "spontaneous".  If they were fraternal you do have a better chance of having them again.. it really just depends on your body... if you're that adamant you could use fertility treatments to help increase your likelihood.

What do you think the odds are?  Dont get me wrong I adore my twins and think it is very special to have them, but I have had a rough year (girls born at 31wks, NICU, etc etc)   I am hoping for an easy pregnancy, delivery this time around.

I also heard this from other places as well but this is what it said:   Ok so you have already won the "Twin Parent lottery" once. What are the odds of you having a second set of twins?   If your first set of twins were fraternal, then your chances of having another set of fraternal twins is multiplied by four! That's 1 in 12!  If your first set of twins were identical, then your chances of having another set of identical twins drops way down to 1 in 70,000 or so.  If you are using fertility treatment, then the chances are the same as with your first set of twins.   Other factors that can increase the odds of multiples  There are many other factors that can increase your odds of having twins or multiples. Some of them are:   Your age. If you are over 50, then your chances of having twins increases to 1 in 9.  Your mother or grandmother is a fraternal twin. Studies have shown that if your mother is a fraternal twin, your chances of having fraternal twins might be has high as 1 in 17.  Your weight. Studies have shown that women with a body mass index of 30 or more have a significantly increased chance of having fraternal twins.   So according to most of the articles that  looked at said that your chance quadruples and it is 1 in 12 if your babies were fraternal and 1 in 70,000 if your babies were identicals.

I am known for my google use lol, aren't I professional? hehe.  Yea mine are fraternal and the only history that I can find in my family is that my great g-ma may have miscarried with twins. So I guess I was just a lucky one! We don't think we will be having anymore kids, but if we do the thought of having another set of twins scares the crap out of us! We don't even have our first set yet, but it's just the thought of having 6 kids is enough to scare the crap out of me!    --  Cortney Taylor Danielle 09/02/05,  Jayden Joseph 04/25/08,  and Tw in boys Bertrand and Bryden 2/9/10!

(she lost 2 singletons). I have 4 sisters and 4 of us 5 sisters have been pregnant 2 or 3 times. I am the only girl with a set of fraternal twins! I never dreamed it would happen to me in my life b/c of the old wives tale "it skips a generation." I really did believe that. However I do fall in to catergory of higher chances to have fraternal twins b/c my mom did, I was in my 30's when the twins were concieved and I am over weight. So I guess it would be possible for it to happen again but I'm not betting on it! Good Luck to you in your new pregnancy though!

My twins are identical but i have been warned by ob gyn and perinatologist that i could have them again at increased risk just because i have done it once. I was so happy I wasnt have fraternal because of increase of happening again until I read some articles and doctors sprung that on me!  I have seen some research that suggest identical twins run on the man's side.  Which explains why some people have more than one set.  I like this theory because i can point the finger at hubby especially when im very crampy and having alot of contractions.

Identical twins are caused by the egg splitting.  As far as me having multiple multiple pregnancies.....the odds are greater of having multiples again than a single birth.    --  Thanks and God Bless, Tiffany FTM to identical twins Trinity Dawn and Destiny Hope and FTM to step-daughters Allison Elizabeth and Carolyn Marie             Reply            Report this comment       0               / 2      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

Uniquemimi wrote: This is a bittersweet situation. Lost my first set of twin boys. That was really hard for me but I moved forward. And a few years later got pregnant with my now 9 mo old girl. I am a single mother it's not easy but I make it work. And now I just found out that I am having twins again.  Father is the same as my daughters but he is not happy and pushing for abortion. I personally was against abortion but was considering it because my daughter is only 9 mo. But I'm torn because I feel how could I abort my twins after losing twins. He makes it seem like abortion is so easy when mentally I know it would be hard to handle. So yes my daughter will not have all the attention she should because I would be caring for two more babies. But I also feel it would not be fair to her if my mental state was not ok. I still think of the babies I lost so I know it will be worst thinking about the ones I aborted. Any words or thoughts ? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  11 Posts a  alyssa122 @Uniquemimi  My partner wanted me to abort too. He didn't want to have any kids ever. And also felt that at my age which is 19, I shouldn't be having kids (We were using protection but it failed) but I really didn't want to abort. Like you I had other things that I needed to consider and aborting would have been the "better" option but my heart wasn't 100% wanting to abort so I choose not too and now, 14 weeks down the track my partner is so excited for the twins to come. He gets excited to come to the scans and he even cried a little when he heard their heartbeats for the first time! Honestly I am happy with my choice and even though my partner was truly against having the twins he's glad that we're having them now c  catconnelll @Uniquemimi  I feel like you're being given a second chance. I had a loss in October, and found out I was having twins in March. It was the best feeling ever. I feel like sometimes we're given opportunities for a reason. I'm not pro abortion at all, so I won't give u my opinion on why I think it's wrong, but I will let u know that I have a best friend who did it, and was ok with it at the time, and to this day, even after having another child isn't over it. She said "if I had known it was going to be that awful, I wouldn't have done it". My BF with my daughter (we aren't together) wanted me to have an abortion. I couldn't go through with it and she is the biggest blessing in my life. You just never know what ur future holds. I know first hand being a single mother sucks, but you can do it momma!!! Good luck with ur decision. Don't let that guy confuse u or manipulate u. Xox U  Uniquemimi @alyssa122  I'm so happy for you and I'm happy that he came around for you. I wish you both the best. The way I feel is similar to the way you feel about abortion. But I know my children's father will probably not come around this time around. He is a very selfish person and is only thinking about himself. U  Uniquemimi @catconnelll  Thank you so much for those words. And I feel like this is a second chance at twins again the timing is a little off but I feel that it wouldn't have happened again if it wasn't meant to be. And then on the other hand I'm afraid that my 9 mo old won't get the attention that she needs. I kind of already made the choice in my head as to what I want to do. But I just needed to hear someone's else's advice because nobody in my family knows what's going on right now and I just need to talk to someone. Thank you so much for replying L  LollyAnn Sometimes life gives us a second chance and I personally wouldn't waste it. I myself miscarried twins and was crushed about it, I went on to have my third child and then 4 months later, just before my partner was to get his vasectomy found out I was pregnant with twins again. I feel like I was meant to have those babies and that maybe they are even the same little souls I lost the first time getting their second chance. I just couldn't see taking that away from them, even though that now gave me 5 children under 4. Good luck whatever you decide. U  Uniquemimi @LollyAnn  Thank you. I am in tears right now because I know you are right and in my heart I know I can't go through with that. I'm just so scared because it's only me. I know I am not the only single parent out there but I am only 23 and the thought of having 3 kids alone is freaking me out. But I believe that every baby is a blessing so maybe this was meant to be. r  redell1 I wouldn't get an abortion.. That really sucks that he wants u to do that! Goods luck with everything d  daisy84003 @Uniquemimi  Go through with the pregnancy. If you deliver and realize you just cannot do it, then adoption is always an option. There are so many families out there waiting for children, that cannot have them on their own. I got pregnant with my son from 19 and debated an abortion. Now that he is 6 years old, I cannot imagine not having him in my life. C  CanadianSmallTownMom @Uniquemimi  There are lots of family's wishing they could have a baby. Have you considered putting the babies up for adoption L  LindseyL15 I'm so sorry you're going through this. Being pregnant is hard. Being pregnant with twins is its own separate hard, and I'm not gonna lie- being a twin Mama is hard, BUT it is also such a special gift to look down and see TWO little lives who literally depend on you in order to survive. I can't begin to understand how you feel with your parter not being supportive and worried for your other child, but I can tell you that your babies are helpless without you and they will love you like no one else can:) there is something special about twins and all moms feel guilty about their older child when a new baby comes/ that is totally normal and shows you are already a good mom who thinks of her children. My friend has a 1 yeR old and twins and she can do it. You can too! Hang in there Mama.

M  MsRss25 Cori30, a may momma is having her second set of twins.. I've seen another mom too. I believe her name is doublebliss... T  Twoplustwins This may be tmi, but my hb decided to finish inside me without warning me.. I looked it up and he did it right smack in the middle of when I should be ovulating... my twins just turned 5 months old.. I guess i will find out in 9 days if im pregnant or not! Wish me luck! 3 under 13 months would be hard... 4 under 13 months.. would be harder! LOL C  Cori30 @Twoplustwins  I'm on my second set of twins, I have fraternal boys (age 3 1/2) and now 21w w/ fraternal girls, both conceived naturally.  T  Twoplustwins @Cori30  I have heard of lots of multiple sets of frats... wondering how likely I would be to have another set of ID... guess only time will tell! =) Congrats to you though! I love having twins... not as hard as everyone made it out to be! d  doulabliss Yep I'm on my second set of fraternal twins. My girls are 21 months now and I'm due with fraternal boys in June. Both spontaneous. I have a 4 year lid singleton too :) C  Cori30 @Twoplustwins  Good luck ;) And I agree, twins keep ya busy, but not nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be.  a  ajlf246 @Twoplustwins  Hey just thought I would share that I'm kinda in that situation, mine are a little older but not by much, and not exactly "twins". I had a daughter on Sept 27th 2008 & I wanted my second really close in age so I got pregnant again by December (when my first dd was 3-4 mos old). I had my son on Sept 28th, 2009 making them a year and a day apart exactly so pretty much Irish twins. Then this past April my hubby & I weren't even thinking about ovulating or babies or anything & sure enough, pregnancy #3 lol. I was okay with it, thinking one more would be fine. At twelve weeks along found out there were twins. So next Friday I'll be having my c-section to welcome our two new baby girls, and my kids will be two and a half, one and a half, and newborns. It will be a little hard at times & tiring I know but I love seeing how close my two kids are now & I know it'll be awesome as they grow up & all have each other. :) Let me know how it goes- you can look me up on Facebook if u want manderz_246@yahoo.com T  Twoplustwins @ajlf246  Congrats! You will be a busy bee won't you?? LOL I have 4, but they are 8,6 and 5 months.. not too bad.  I just have a feeling that i am going to be pregnant, but not sure yet obviously.. I am a little anxious.. I don't know what he was thinking.. but i have to admit that I am a tad excited! LOL We decided that if i am pregnant we wont tell a soul until i can't hide it anymore! And I will def look you up! Thanks Jen J  Jmhamilton3 @Twoplustwins  From everything I've read it is much more comman to have 2 sets of frats than 2 sets of idents. The egg splitting is random and the 2 eggs is not. So if you are pregnant, good chance it will be only one baby. Good luck! Your girls are adorable! T  Twoplustwins @Jmhamilton3  Thanks... I know that having two sets of id would be rare.. But wanted to see if anyone here has two sets.. Also I'm wondering if since I just started getting my period from being pregnant if I'd be more likely to be releasing two eggs.... I can test on the 8th.. Can't come soon enough!

Started by proudmumoftwingirls , Aug 27 2009 11:05 AM        Please log in to reply     10 replies to this topic            #1   proudmumoftwingirls    Posted 27 August 2009 - 11:05 AM    I gave birth to fraternal twin girls 4mths ago. They were conceived naturally. We are concidering having more children in the next few years, but are just wondering if the chances of conceiving twins again is higher once you have them. Also how long after having twins did you have more babies and how difficult was it? Both my husband and I are 26 and want to complete our family by the time we are 30. How much did everything change for you with 3. I am just thinking of the logistics of everything ie: new car will be needed unless we can fit 3 car seats in a Ford XR6. We have 2 safe n sound meridian car seats at the moment and I can only just fit between them.      Back to top                #2   nessrose    Posted 27 August 2009 - 12:56 PM    I'm a fraternal twin. I've had a singleton who is 4, then fraternal twins who are 2. I'm now 35 weeks pregnant with a singleton again. Your chances do increase if you've had fraternals before (about 4 times more likely than the average woman to have them again), however I guess it's the risk you have to take if you want more than 2. Did have me worried though so I know what you mean. Logistically you just learn to cope. We used a double pram with skateboard for DD1. She now walks though. Up until now we've had a Falcon Stationwagon which had plenty of room for kids, prams and groceries etc. We've now upgraded to a Tarago. I'm finding it great at the moment although at times challenging. Trying not to think about what it is going to be like having 4 under 4 and 2 months!  I guess it depends on the personality of your twins too, whether or not they are sleeping through the night etc. Even though this pregnancy wasn't exactly planned (although is very much wanted), my girls have been sleeping through the night since they were 5 months old so am not too worried about going through the whole newborn stage again. You are definitely bound to be more relaxed having had more than one before as well. Good luck.

Back to top                #4   gumby    Posted 27 August 2009 - 04:26 PM    Yes, if you naturally conceived fraternal twins, your chances of having them again are definitely very much increased.   Our frat twins were #3 & #4 and we are very much completed by them but if it helps, this is my 'gyno' history. DS#1 - Singleton M/C - Blighted ovum M/C - Twins M/C - Partial Molar preg DS#2 - Singleton DS#3 & DD1 - Twins From my own history, it would seem that I sometimes release two eggs.  If we were not finished with our family, we would definitely have to factor in the increased likelihood of multiples in any subsequent pregnancies. Good luck, you have adorable looking girls there       Back to top                #5   lustreless    Posted 27 August 2009 - 07:07 PM    My twins are also fraternal and naturally concieved, #2 and #3 I am pregnant with my second singleton since having my twins so I am here to assure you it probably won't happen again It was something I really worried about because I did not cope very well with my twins until they started school. I think out of all my years here on EB there is only one lady I know of that has had a second set of naturally conceived twins so its not as prevalent as the odds might make you believe. There have been a couple of others but those twins were results of fertility treatment. If you want another baby I say go for it, if you do have twins again it was obviously meant to be. PS - My twins were over 6 pounds each....how the hell did you carry two 8+ pound babies??       Back to top                #6   sarah-m    Posted 27 August 2009 - 07:21 PM    Oh wow, I'm just lurking here, but I too think the size of your girls is incredible and you went to term too!!! My DS was 8lb 1 oz and I was proud of myself cause I thought THAT was big       Back to top                #7   Phoebe2010    Posted 27 August 2009 - 08:03 PM    I'm another one gasping at your fabulous birth weights. I'm 9 weeks pregnant with twins and scared about low birth weight and associated problems - what was your secret?? Sorry I can't help with your question - these are my first.      Back to top                #8   proudmumoftwingirls    Posted 28 August 2009 - 03:05 PM    LOL A lot of people are astouded when I tell them that both my girls were over 8lb each when born. I am pretty god damn proud of myself that I got them to term. Believe me it was not easy carrying them especially the last month or two. I was hospitalised with back pain before birth and pretty much camped on the lounge for the last month or two of the pregnancy. I even rang when obstetrician crying one day a few weeks before they were born to deliver them early as I was in so much pain. Thank goodness he wouldn't do it as it gave them more time to grow and I am thankful for it now. I don't have a secret for it. I couldn't eat much while I was pregnant as the first 3mths I had 24/7 nausea (no vomitting though) so couldn't really eat. I craved milk for the last 4-5 months of my pregnancy so that may have contributed somehow I guess. I love having twins, but hated being pregnant with them so I wouldn't be disappointed if I ended up with another set once we decide to try again. Has anyone heard of twins this size or bigger? I know it's not that common. I might start a new topic finding out as it would be interesting to know. BECSJ - I have recovered great. I had a caesar so was uncomfortable for about 6wks, but not out of action. As with a natural birth aswell my hormones went crazy for about 3-4wks after the birth and I was pretty emotional about anything and everything, but got over it and I feel great these days. My girls are great and it has been so easy so far. Ask me again when they are moving about on their own lol.       Back to top                #9   Butterscotch    Posted 30 August 2009 - 08:40 AM    There's been a few threads on this which might be helpful (I recall starting a couple 2 or so years ago when we were trying to decide!), could pay to search or look back a few pages I had a similar dilemma when trying to decide whether or nto to have another baby after my twin daughters.  My girls are fraternal too.  As others have said, your chances of having twins again are higher than your average, but there's more chance you'd have a singleton (generally speaking, I can't say for certain for you personally as I do know of numerous cases of women having more than one set of naturally conceived multiples!  Some women are made to have multiples I guess! ) While we were trying to decide on whether or not to have another, God decided for us, and when Emily and Kailtyn were 20 months old I found myself pregnant!  I was VERY scared of having twins again.  We didn't have a good experience with pregnancy/birth/they were prem and never slept or fed well.  Lucky for us, we had a singleton.  There was 2yrs,4mths between them.  I would have liked a bigger age gap, but as they're all getting older I'm glad for a smaller one, so it's kinda short term pain, for long term gain.  I agree with a PP who said it depends a lot on the personality and habits of your kids, and the parents!  None of my kids have been good sleepers so that doesn't help... Oh.  And.  YES!  Am suitably impressed with your twin DD's weights How brilliant! (my two were 1.5 and 1.6kgs )   Edited by Butterscotch, 30 August 2009 - 08:41 AM.

I have no known family history of twins either and no fertility tx/meds ever. My husband always jokes we would end up with triplets if we had another pregnancy. Odds are higher than the general population for another set of fraternals. I guess the only way to find out is to try for another baby. Just kinda freaks me out that there are even moms that don't have a strong family history of multiples and no fertility treatments end up with two sets. Amazing!!! Congrats!

This is because most women who conceive fraternals (without fertility drugs) show a pattern of releasing more than one egg per cycle. Your chance of a second set numerically, is about 1 in 3000 The odds of having one set of identicals and one set of fraternals is 1 in 10,000. If a woman has one set of identicals, her chance of having another is 1 in 70,000 or less. The odds of having 3 sets of twins, of any kind, is 1 in 500,000.

Most likely the 2nd and maybe even 3rd pregnancy would be singles. twins after twins typically occur 2-3 pregnancies apart. I had b/g twins Feb 2009 and when I found out Nov 2009 I was pregnant again, I freaked out and spoke to a specialist and he assured me that, although it is possible, it is not very likely at all. He said to beware though the next pregnancy. Some people say that they can ONLY have twins, but even this is not true. It may be true that they ONLY ovulate multiple eggs but that does not even mean that each egg will be fertilized and implant. The chances of even one ovulated egg being fertilized and implanting to become and embryo is still not 100% so much less so is it that 2 or more would be. That is another reason twins are not so common as singletons. You should be fine. Of course, as everything else in life, it is never guaranteed, but your chances are tremendously higher of having a single birth this time around. But like my specialist told me...if you have another after this one, don't be surprised to see 2 again! GL! oh and by the way, I am only having 1 this time!

Not for the same reason. If I could guarantee twins the second time around I wouldn't hesitate. Just can't imagine a family of 5.

As I understand it if your twins are identical, you are no more likely than anyone else to have more twins - it is non identical twins that are genetic, and are therefore more likely to be repeated - that said, I do know of a fair few execeptions to this 'apparent' rule!

I heard that you have a 1 in 12 chance of having another set of twins if you have non-ID twins. If you have ID twins then they don't run in families so you have as much chance of having ID's as anyone else so it's about 1 in 250 chance. Having said that I know of 2 ladies who had ID twins first and are either pregnant with or are have a set of non-ID's. Apparently it is a 1 in a million chance of having ID's followed by non-ID's. I know 2 ladies who had non-ID's first and then went on to have ID's and another lady who has non-ID's and is pregnant with her 2nd set of non-ID's    Mummy to gorgeous ID twin boys born June 2009 at 36 weeks        Reply With Quote             12-12-15, 03:17    #12        Becc S    View Profile    View Forum Posts       Member         Join Date  May 2015  Location  wolverhampton  Posts  142          I have 11 month old twins boy & girl & love to have more twins lol my pregnancy was so nice tho. worst part was the sickness & the hotness (that was it lol) especial in the middle of winter I was getting looked at like I was crazy cuz I war vest tops while it was snowing no coat or jumper lol but I wad so dam bloody hot lol          Reply With Quote             26-12-15, 22:53    #13           Fiona F(318)    View Profile    View Forum Posts       Member         Join Date  Mar 2015  Location  Cwmbran  Posts  83          I have non identical twin boys and was told that there is a 1 in 12 chance of having twins again, but this can increase if you're over 30 and/or overweight apparently.

If you have identical twins you are no more likely to have twins then anybody else as the splitting of an egg is just a fluke. Anybody over 30 is more likely to have twins as your body may release two or more eggs to help increase your chances of getting pregnant as (in nature terms) time might be running out to get pregnant.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

According to conventional wisdom, twins not only run in families, but they also — for some strange reason — always skip at least one generation. It is a claim that is widely repeated, but only partly true.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    Scientists have known for some time that there is a gene that can predispose women to hyperovulation, or releasing two or more eggs in a single menstrual cycle. When both eggs are fertilized, the resulting siblings are fraternal twins.  Because this gene can be passed on, the tendency to have fraternal twins can in fact run in families. Identical twins, on the other hand, result from one fertilized egg randomly splitting in two, creating two siblings with identical DNA. Because there is no known gene that influences this process, it is considered a mere coincidence when one extended family has multiple sets of identical twins. The notion that twins always skip a generation is also a myth. The illusion may have arisen because men who inherit the gene from their mothers are unaffected by it ( they do not ovulate), but can still pass it on to their daughters, who, in turn, will have an increased likelihood of conceiving twins. THE BOTTOM LINE Twins can run in families, but do not necessarily bypass generations.   scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: Twins always skip a generation.

Twins are defined as two offspring born together, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are born on the same date. Multiples are generally born only a few minutes apart. If delivered by cesarian section , the interval between births is usually only a minute, maybe two. The interval is generally longer for vaginal deliveries, ranging from a few minutes to more than an hour.         In modern times, if the time period extends much beyond that, doctors elect to perform a C-section for the second baby, fearing distress or the risk of infection. However, some studies make a case against this practice. There are exceptions to the rule that twins have the same birthday. Some are due to a delivery near midnight, while others may extend to longer intervals due to medical intervention delaying the interval of births. Delayed Interval Births In some cases, a delayed interval birth takes place when one multiple is delivered prematurely, but doctors are able to halt labor and keep the remaining multiple(s) in their mother's womb to grow and develop. Some of these multiples—twins, triplets or more—were born days, weeks or even months apart. These are rare events. Twins Born on Either Side of Midnight The difference between today and tomorrow is literally a matter of seconds. Plenty of babies are delivered in the middle of the night.   Babies that are born close to midnight may arrive on different days. For example, Twin A may be born at 11:59 pm on one day while Twin B doesn't make an appearance until 12:01 am, which would be the next day. This can create some interesting dilemmas. For example, two British twins were born either side of midnight on August 31 and September 1.         Unfortunately, September 1 is the cut-off date for starting school in their area, so only the first-born twin would turn 5 in time for the start of kindergarten. The father, a twin himself, said he would do everything possible to ensure they both were in the same grade at school. The difference in the month would also matter for when they were due for immunizations, even though there were born only minutes apart. While common sense may rule, sometimes there are strict date cutoffs encoded in law that would require petitioning for an exception. Twins Born in Different Years, Decades, and Millennia There are cases of twins born in different years. In Texas, twins were born only one minute apart, but in different years, delivered by C-section as the last baby of 2013 and the first baby of 2014.  A similar situation occurred as 2015 changed to 2016 in San Diego with fraternal twins. Twins can be born in different decades, as happened as 2009 changed to 2010 and a pair of Florida twins came into the world on each side of the dividing line. To top it all, there are twins born in different millennia. Twins were born in Massachusetts only eight minutes apart, but they were born in proximity to the turn of the millennium in 2000.         One boy arrived on New Year's Eve, 1999, just a few minutes shy of midnight. And in the first few seconds of the year 2000, his twin brother took his first breath. In these cases, there can be ongoing implications for eligibility for programs and services as well as tax deductions. The parents would have to advocate for including both twins the year the first was eligible or delaying until both were eligible, if possible. Source: Porreco RP, Farkouh LJ.

By Stephanie / 5						COMMENTS  111 Shares    Most moms consider themselves lucky enough to have one set of twins, but if you’re incredibly lucky, then you might even end up with two pairs of twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice? What are the chances of having twins? The birth rate for twins is only going up, rising by as much as 76% in the last 30 years. That means that your chance of having twins in the USA is as high as 3 in 100 births. But that’s fraternal twins. The chance of identical twins is the same as it’s always been, which is around 3 in 1000 babies born as identical twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice? Obviously, the chance of having two sets of twins is pretty rare, but it’s not as rare as you might think. If you’re looking for two sets of twins of any type, the chance of that is around 1 in 3,000, which is the same chance as getting struck by lightning during your life!   A set of identical twins and fraternal twins is only around 1 in 10,000, or the same odds that you’re going to fall off your toilet and end up in hospital! Having two sets of identical twins is pretty damn unlikely, with only 1 chance in 70,000. Bear in mind that if you’ve already got one set of twins, you might actually be more likely to have a second set, because of all of the things that increase your chances of twin births. Things like: Having already been pregnant before. Women who have already had a baby, including women who have already had twins, are more likely to have twins in the future! Getting older. Women over the age of around 35 have more twins in general, because in the few years before you hit peri-menopause, your ovaries start to release more than one egg at a time. Having some sort of fertility treatment, like IVF or fertility drugs. These sort of things can stimulate your body to produce multiple eggs over and over. Coming from a family with twins in it. There’s some sort of genetic component to twins, and if twins run in your family, then you’re more likely to have them. This also means that if you’ve had twins once, they might run in your family and you might have them again! Being on the pill, or just coming off of the pill. Apparently, the hormonal changes that the pill causes in women can increase their chances of having twins. Being taller or heavier than average. Taller and heavier women have a greater than normal chance of having twins . But remember to stay healthy! Make sure your partner has a lot of zinc in his diet. Zinc contributes to healthy sperm, and the healthier your partner’s sperm, the more you have of chance of conceiving twins! Twins are getting more and more common, so if you have one set of twins and you’re going for another, you might just get lucky! How do you think you would cope with two sets of twins? Do you know anyone who actually has two sets of twins? Or maybe you’re one of the incredibly fortunate women who beat the odds and has an awesome foursome! Let us know in the comments below!        Nicole  says: October 25, 2017 at 10:20 pm I actually know 2 people within 30 mins of each other who have 2 pairs of twins! Reply   Deidre Turner  says: November 17, 2017 at 5:01 am Me! I’m 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins (both di/di). My first set were conceived with the assistance of fertility treatment (IUI), then I had a singleton conceived naturally and I’m pregnant with twins again, conceived naturally this time. I’m not particularly tall or big, I’m under 35 (currently 34 and was 29 having my first set), I haven’t been on the pill for years and hubby’s sperm counts are ok but not great. I’ve only been pregnant 3 times. I was on only 25mg (half a tablet) of clomid for 4 cycles over 5 years ago so that’s all the fertility drugs I ever took. It explains the first set but not the second set. I think that family history is my biggest influence; my nanna had 2 sets of twins and a set of triplets; my mum is one of the triplets. I’m the only one in my large extended family who has had any multiples at all so it looks like the twin gene skipped straight to me! Reply   Katie Hopkins  says: February 28, 2018 at 7:51 am I’m 24 years old and pregnant with my second set of twins. No fertility treatments or help . My first set of twins are boy/ girl fraternal twins . And are turning a year old in a month. My current pregnancy are identical boy (mo/di) twins. They will be here in June or before. So I got one set of each , not on purpose , but definitely blessed. Reply   Sammie  says: March 15, 2018 at 5:52 am I am currently 28, and 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins. Fraternal twins boy/girl set.  My first set of twins are fraternal twin girls they are four now. Never thought this would happen to me. I am not overweight, not y’all only 5’1 and am under 35. So this just shows that it can happen to anyone. Both sets conceived naturally. Only been pregnant twice, so I guess I can help honestly say I’ve been blessed . Good luck to you all. Reply   Stacey  says: March 22, 2018 at 6:01 pm I’m 12 weeks pregnant with my second set of mo/di (identical) twins. I have identical boys who just turned 4. Never thought in a million years we’d have 2 sets of twins. I’m 34, no fertility treatments, no family/genetic history of twins. Just blessed!

But, when reading the below, keep in mind that Michelle Duggar who has 18 children, only has 2 sets of twins!  Here's some good information:  Factors that Influence Twins Twins can occur naturally in any woman at any time. However, there are certain factors that increase your chances of having twins. These factors include:     Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably.    Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins.    Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. Women produce more ovulation-stimulating hormone as they age, increasing your chance of releasing more than one egg during ovulation. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39.    Previous Twins: If you’ve already had twins, it is more likely that you will have another twin pregnancy.    Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.    Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, women can increase their chances of having twins up to 20%.    Weight Gain : A study by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology linked the recent rise in multiple births with the steady rise of obesity in North America. Women with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 are more likely to have twins than those in the suggested BMI range of 19 to 25.     --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     j_l_badders    Posted 02/06/2009      I heard its more likely with fraternal than identicalsince fraternal is about releasing more than one egg and identical is a by chance thing with the egg splitting but I read somewhere (have no clue where now) while I was pregnant that its more than a 50% after fraternal but that doesn't seem likely???I do however know a 2x twin mom so yeah it happens.

But again, the chances are not 50% like some people think...again, Michelle Duggar has only had 2 sets of twins among her 18 children, and they were pretty far apart with several singletons in between.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     tazzersize2000 · Original Poster    Posted 02/06/2009      wow!  a co-worker at my old job had one kid then had a set of twins!!???mommytotwingirls do you plan on having any other children?

I heard from someone you can do a test to see if you ovulate two eggs every time.  If that is that case you can always do IVF  (in vitro fertilization) and put in one egg.  A friend of a friend wants to do this because her twins were born very early because of a problem she has and does not want to risk having another set of twins and losing them both.    --  JAM DS 1/2005 , DD 12/2006 Twins!

What are the chances of having twins twice?             aidasanchez26    Posted 08/12/2017       I have 16 month old twin boys. I wasn't ovulating at the time my DH  (dear husband) & I were tttc. So I started to take Vitex (a natural supplement to help you ovulate) within 3 wks of taking it O  (ovulation) became pregnant with the twins. I should also mention that I was taking twice the dosage recommended on the bottle as I was so desperate to become pregnant. I feel that caused spontaneous ovulation & I became pregnant with twins. We are thinking of trying again but are scared to become pregnant again with twins. I wouldn't take Vitex or any other supplement this time around, I would try naturally. I just turned 34 on July. Has anyone become pregnant with a singleton naturally after having twins?

But plenty of people have additional sets of twins too. I'd say go for it, but not til you're prepared for the possibility of twins again.

Overall though, it's about 1:11.  Think of Michelle Duggar.  She's had at least 21 pregnancies (that we know of) and in that, only 2 sets of fraternal twins, so she fits right in with the approx. 1:11 odds.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB             Reply            Report this comment       0                    TafadzwaJC    Posted 08/16/2017      I have a similar situation for me this time around I got pregnant naturally and my twin boys are only 18months old so am waiting to get my ultrasound and am nervous, scared, excited, anxious &all.....that I can have multiples again considering that twins run in my family, my mum had twins though they passed away and lots of my cousins have twins.

Actual statistics are unknown whether it is more or less than mathmatically predicted. If that makes any sense.  IN OTHER WORDS - HAVE FUN AT YOUR ULTRASOUND!  Really though, I can't imagine it any other way. We've thought about if we have 'another' what if it is only one? How lonely would s/he be with 4 big sisters who are all best friends? Would we have another after that? What if the 'other' was also twins?

Although our identical girls didn't make it - I still consider myself to have had 2 sets.Â  both have been confirmed identical.Â  again the chances are super rare.Â  I've met a few people who've had a couple sets of fraternal though.    --  Married to DH 5/1/04 - DD  3/13/08 - twin angel baby girls born at 19.5 weeks 6/15/10 R a i n b o w twin BOYS 4/10/11!

Â My first set were 3 in April and I am due with this set in September. Â There is a woman who goes to the same perinatal center as me that has 3 sets of identicals (I don't know the sexes), someone who goes to the same pool as me with 2 sets of identical girls and someone else I met said they were the 3rd set of identicals their mom was pregnant with (and the only survivors). Â  There has been new research in the past few years on identical twins that shows it is not as random as they thought...it is genetic. Â But it is a combination of the parents.

If they were identical that doesn't increase your chances any more than any other woman, unfortunately, since they're "spontaneous".  If they were fraternal you do have a better chance of having them again.. it really just depends on your body... if you're that adamant you could use fertility treatments to help increase your likelihood.

What do you think the odds are?  Dont get me wrong I adore my twins and think it is very special to have them, but I have had a rough year (girls born at 31wks, NICU, etc etc)   I am hoping for an easy pregnancy, delivery this time around.

I also heard this from other places as well but this is what it said:   Ok so you have already won the "Twin Parent lottery" once. What are the odds of you having a second set of twins?   If your first set of twins were fraternal, then your chances of having another set of fraternal twins is multiplied by four! That's 1 in 12!  If your first set of twins were identical, then your chances of having another set of identical twins drops way down to 1 in 70,000 or so.  If you are using fertility treatment, then the chances are the same as with your first set of twins.   Other factors that can increase the odds of multiples  There are many other factors that can increase your odds of having twins or multiples. Some of them are:   Your age. If you are over 50, then your chances of having twins increases to 1 in 9.  Your mother or grandmother is a fraternal twin. Studies have shown that if your mother is a fraternal twin, your chances of having fraternal twins might be has high as 1 in 17.  Your weight. Studies have shown that women with a body mass index of 30 or more have a significantly increased chance of having fraternal twins.   So according to most of the articles that  looked at said that your chance quadruples and it is 1 in 12 if your babies were fraternal and 1 in 70,000 if your babies were identicals.

However I do fall in to catergory of higher chances to have fraternal twins b/c my mom did, I was in my 30's when the twins were concieved and I am over weight. So I guess it would be possible for it to happen again but I'm not betting on it! Good Luck to you in your new pregnancy though!

My twins are identical but i have been warned by ob gyn and perinatologist that i could have them again at increased risk just because i have done it once. I was so happy I wasnt have fraternal because of increase of happening again until I read some articles and doctors sprung that on me!  I have seen some research that suggest identical twins run on the man's side.  Which explains why some people have more than one set.  I like this theory because i can point the finger at hubby especially when im very crampy and having alot of contractions.

Identical twins are not from hereditary genetics. Identical twins are caused by the egg splitting.  As far as me having multiple multiple pregnancies.....the odds are greater of having multiples again than a single birth.    --  Thanks and God Bless, Tiffany FTM to identical twins Trinity Dawn and Destiny Hope and FTM to step-daughters Allison Elizabeth and Carolyn Marie             Reply            Report this comment       0               / 2      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

Uniquemimi wrote: This is a bittersweet situation. Lost my first set of twin boys. That was really hard for me but I moved forward. And a few years later got pregnant with my now 9 mo old girl. I am a single mother it's not easy but I make it work. And now I just found out that I am having twins again.  Father is the same as my daughters but he is not happy and pushing for abortion. I personally was against abortion but was considering it because my daughter is only 9 mo. But I'm torn because I feel how could I abort my twins after losing twins. He makes it seem like abortion is so easy when mentally I know it would be hard to handle. So yes my daughter will not have all the attention she should because I would be caring for two more babies. But I also feel it would not be fair to her if my mental state was not ok. I still think of the babies I lost so I know it will be worst thinking about the ones I aborted. Any words or thoughts ? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  11 Posts a  alyssa122 @Uniquemimi  My partner wanted me to abort too. He didn't want to have any kids ever. And also felt that at my age which is 19, I shouldn't be having kids (We were using protection but it failed) but I really didn't want to abort. Like you I had other things that I needed to consider and aborting would have been the "better" option but my heart wasn't 100% wanting to abort so I choose not too and now, 14 weeks down the track my partner is so excited for the twins to come. He gets excited to come to the scans and he even cried a little when he heard their heartbeats for the first time! Honestly I am happy with my choice and even though my partner was truly against having the twins he's glad that we're having them now c  catconnelll @Uniquemimi  I feel like you're being given a second chance. I had a loss in October, and found out I was having twins in March. It was the best feeling ever. I feel like sometimes we're given opportunities for a reason. I'm not pro abortion at all, so I won't give u my opinion on why I think it's wrong, but I will let u know that I have a best friend who did it, and was ok with it at the time, and to this day, even after having another child isn't over it. She said "if I had known it was going to be that awful, I wouldn't have done it". My BF with my daughter (we aren't together) wanted me to have an abortion. I couldn't go through with it and she is the biggest blessing in my life. You just never know what ur future holds. I know first hand being a single mother sucks, but you can do it momma!!! Good luck with ur decision. Don't let that guy confuse u or manipulate u. Xox U  Uniquemimi @alyssa122  I'm so happy for you and I'm happy that he came around for you. I wish you both the best. The way I feel is similar to the way you feel about abortion. But I know my children's father will probably not come around this time around. He is a very selfish person and is only thinking about himself. U  Uniquemimi @catconnelll  Thank you so much for those words. And I feel like this is a second chance at twins again the timing is a little off but I feel that it wouldn't have happened again if it wasn't meant to be. And then on the other hand I'm afraid that my 9 mo old won't get the attention that she needs. I kind of already made the choice in my head as to what I want to do. But I just needed to hear someone's else's advice because nobody in my family knows what's going on right now and I just need to talk to someone. Thank you so much for replying L  LollyAnn Sometimes life gives us a second chance and I personally wouldn't waste it. I myself miscarried twins and was crushed about it, I went on to have my third child and then 4 months later, just before my partner was to get his vasectomy found out I was pregnant with twins again. I feel like I was meant to have those babies and that maybe they are even the same little souls I lost the first time getting their second chance. I just couldn't see taking that away from them, even though that now gave me 5 children under 4. Good luck whatever you decide. U  Uniquemimi @LollyAnn  Thank you. I am in tears right now because I know you are right and in my heart I know I can't go through with that. I'm just so scared because it's only me. I know I am not the only single parent out there but I am only 23 and the thought of having 3 kids alone is freaking me out. But I believe that every baby is a blessing so maybe this was meant to be. r  redell1 I wouldn't get an abortion.. That really sucks that he wants u to do that! Goods luck with everything d  daisy84003 @Uniquemimi  Go through with the pregnancy. If you deliver and realize you just cannot do it, then adoption is always an option. There are so many families out there waiting for children, that cannot have them on their own. I got pregnant with my son from 19 and debated an abortion. Now that he is 6 years old, I cannot imagine not having him in my life. C  CanadianSmallTownMom @Uniquemimi  There are lots of family's wishing they could have a baby. Have you considered putting the babies up for adoption L  LindseyL15 I'm so sorry you're going through this. Being pregnant is hard. Being pregnant with twins is its own separate hard, and I'm not gonna lie- being a twin Mama is hard, BUT it is also such a special gift to look down and see TWO little lives who literally depend on you in order to survive. I can't begin to understand how you feel with your parter not being supportive and worried for your other child, but I can tell you that your babies are helpless without you and they will love you like no one else can:) there is something special about twins and all moms feel guilty about their older child when a new baby comes/ that is totally normal and shows you are already a good mom who thinks of her children. My friend has a 1 yeR old and twins and she can do it. You can too! Hang in there Mama.

Both are fraternal. I'm 18 weeks pregnant with fraternal twin boys and have 23 month old twin girls. I conceived naturally and was shocked that I had 2 sets in a row. I've heard that it's possible to have multiple multiples but usually not consecutively. L  Lisa2273 @mommy2twincesses   "according to everything I've read, mothers with twins are 4 times more likely to have another set, so you just might get your wish :o) GL!!!" I think if I were to find out I was having another set of twins....I would faint. But, thank you for that info, I was wondering what the odds were. NO, I'm not pregnant..hehe.  s  stacysv650s @twinmum2011  I am currently 20 weeks with identical girls.....this will be my husbands 2nd set of twins. He has a set of fraternal b/g twins that are 6.......we were shocked that he did it again lol, or it was me that did it i dunno its confusing L  Lisa2273 @stacysv650s  He didn't do anything. It's the woman that determines how many eggs will be released or if the egg splits. He only fertilizes what's already there. Related Articles & Discussions a What are the chances?

M  MsRss25 Cori30, a may momma is having her second set of twins.. I've seen another mom too. I believe her name is doublebliss... T  Twoplustwins This may be tmi, but my hb decided to finish inside me without warning me.. I looked it up and he did it right smack in the middle of when I should be ovulating... my twins just turned 5 months old.. I guess i will find out in 9 days if im pregnant or not! Wish me luck! 3 under 13 months would be hard... 4 under 13 months.. would be harder! LOL C  Cori30 @Twoplustwins  I'm on my second set of twins, I have fraternal boys (age 3 1/2) and now 21w w/ fraternal girls, both conceived naturally.  T  Twoplustwins @Cori30  I have heard of lots of multiple sets of frats... wondering how likely I would be to have another set of ID... guess only time will tell! =) Congrats to you though! I love having twins... not as hard as everyone made it out to be! d  doulabliss Yep I'm on my second set of fraternal twins. My girls are 21 months now and I'm due with fraternal boys in June. Both spontaneous. I have a 4 year lid singleton too :) C  Cori30 @Twoplustwins  Good luck ;) And I agree, twins keep ya busy, but not nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be.  a  ajlf246 @Twoplustwins  Hey just thought I would share that I'm kinda in that situation, mine are a little older but not by much, and not exactly "twins". I had a daughter on Sept 27th 2008 & I wanted my second really close in age so I got pregnant again by December (when my first dd was 3-4 mos old). I had my son on Sept 28th, 2009 making them a year and a day apart exactly so pretty much Irish twins. Then this past April my hubby & I weren't even thinking about ovulating or babies or anything & sure enough, pregnancy #3 lol. I was okay with it, thinking one more would be fine. At twelve weeks along found out there were twins. So next Friday I'll be having my c-section to welcome our two new baby girls, and my kids will be two and a half, one and a half, and newborns. It will be a little hard at times & tiring I know but I love seeing how close my two kids are now & I know it'll be awesome as they grow up & all have each other. :) Let me know how it goes- you can look me up on Facebook if u want manderz_246@yahoo.com T  Twoplustwins @ajlf246  Congrats! You will be a busy bee won't you?? LOL I have 4, but they are 8,6 and 5 months.. not too bad.  I just have a feeling that i am going to be pregnant, but not sure yet obviously.. I am a little anxious.. I don't know what he was thinking.. but i have to admit that I am a tad excited! LOL We decided that if i am pregnant we wont tell a soul until i can't hide it anymore! And I will def look you up! Thanks Jen J  Jmhamilton3 @Twoplustwins  From everything I've read it is much more comman to have 2 sets of frats than 2 sets of idents. The egg splitting is random and the 2 eggs is not. So if you are pregnant, good chance it will be only one baby. Good luck! Your girls are adorable! T  Twoplustwins @Jmhamilton3  Thanks... I know that having two sets of id would be rare.. But wanted to see if anyone here has two sets.. Also I'm wondering if since I just started getting my period from being pregnant if I'd be more likely to be releasing two eggs.... I can test on the 8th.. Can't come soon enough!

Started by proudmumoftwingirls , Aug 27 2009 11:05 AM        Please log in to reply     10 replies to this topic            #1   proudmumoftwingirls    Posted 27 August 2009 - 11:05 AM    I gave birth to fraternal twin girls 4mths ago. They were conceived naturally. We are concidering having more children in the next few years, but are just wondering if the chances of conceiving twins again is higher once you have them. Also how long after having twins did you have more babies and how difficult was it? Both my husband and I are 26 and want to complete our family by the time we are 30. How much did everything change for you with 3. I am just thinking of the logistics of everything ie: new car will be needed unless we can fit 3 car seats in a Ford XR6. We have 2 safe n sound meridian car seats at the moment and I can only just fit between them.      Back to top                #2   nessrose    Posted 27 August 2009 - 12:56 PM    I'm a fraternal twin. I've had a singleton who is 4, then fraternal twins who are 2. I'm now 35 weeks pregnant with a singleton again. Your chances do increase if you've had fraternals before (about 4 times more likely than the average woman to have them again), however I guess it's the risk you have to take if you want more than 2. Did have me worried though so I know what you mean. Logistically you just learn to cope. We used a double pram with skateboard for DD1. She now walks though. Up until now we've had a Falcon Stationwagon which had plenty of room for kids, prams and groceries etc. We've now upgraded to a Tarago. I'm finding it great at the moment although at times challenging. Trying not to think about what it is going to be like having 4 under 4 and 2 months!  I guess it depends on the personality of your twins too, whether or not they are sleeping through the night etc. Even though this pregnancy wasn't exactly planned (although is very much wanted), my girls have been sleeping through the night since they were 5 months old so am not too worried about going through the whole newborn stage again. You are definitely bound to be more relaxed having had more than one before as well. Good luck.

Edited by becsj, 27 August 2009 - 04:15 PM.       Back to top                #4   gumby    Posted 27 August 2009 - 04:26 PM    Yes, if you naturally conceived fraternal twins, your chances of having them again are definitely very much increased.   Our frat twins were #3 & #4 and we are very much completed by them but if it helps, this is my 'gyno' history. DS#1 - Singleton M/C - Blighted ovum M/C - Twins M/C - Partial Molar preg DS#2 - Singleton DS#3 & DD1 - Twins From my own history, it would seem that I sometimes release two eggs.  If we were not finished with our family, we would definitely have to factor in the increased likelihood of multiples in any subsequent pregnancies. Good luck, you have adorable looking girls there       Back to top                #5   lustreless    Posted 27 August 2009 - 07:07 PM    My twins are also fraternal and naturally concieved, #2 and #3 I am pregnant with my second singleton since having my twins so I am here to assure you it probably won't happen again It was something I really worried about because I did not cope very well with my twins until they started school. I think out of all my years here on EB there is only one lady I know of that has had a second set of naturally conceived twins so its not as prevalent as the odds might make you believe. There have been a couple of others but those twins were results of fertility treatment. If you want another baby I say go for it, if you do have twins again it was obviously meant to be. PS - My twins were over 6 pounds each....how the hell did you carry two 8+ pound babies??

I'm 9 weeks pregnant with twins and scared about low birth weight and associated problems - what was your secret?? Sorry I can't help with your question - these are my first.      Back to top                #8   proudmumoftwingirls    Posted 28 August 2009 - 03:05 PM    LOL A lot of people are astouded when I tell them that both my girls were over 8lb each when born. I am pretty god damn proud of myself that I got them to term. Believe me it was not easy carrying them especially the last month or two. I was hospitalised with back pain before birth and pretty much camped on the lounge for the last month or two of the pregnancy. I even rang when obstetrician crying one day a few weeks before they were born to deliver them early as I was in so much pain. Thank goodness he wouldn't do it as it gave them more time to grow and I am thankful for it now. I don't have a secret for it. I couldn't eat much while I was pregnant as the first 3mths I had 24/7 nausea (no vomitting though) so couldn't really eat. I craved milk for the last 4-5 months of my pregnancy so that may have contributed somehow I guess. I love having twins, but hated being pregnant with them so I wouldn't be disappointed if I ended up with another set once we decide to try again. Has anyone heard of twins this size or bigger? I know it's not that common. I might start a new topic finding out as it would be interesting to know. BECSJ - I have recovered great. I had a caesar so was uncomfortable for about 6wks, but not out of action. As with a natural birth aswell my hormones went crazy for about 3-4wks after the birth and I was pretty emotional about anything and everything, but got over it and I feel great these days. My girls are great and it has been so easy so far. Ask me again when they are moving about on their own lol.       Back to top                #9   Butterscotch    Posted 30 August 2009 - 08:40 AM    There's been a few threads on this which might be helpful (I recall starting a couple 2 or so years ago when we were trying to decide!), could pay to search or look back a few pages I had a similar dilemma when trying to decide whether or nto to have another baby after my twin daughters.  My girls are fraternal too.  As others have said, your chances of having twins again are higher than your average, but there's more chance you'd have a singleton (generally speaking, I can't say for certain for you personally as I do know of numerous cases of women having more than one set of naturally conceived multiples!  Some women are made to have multiples I guess! ) While we were trying to decide on whether or not to have another, God decided for us, and when Emily and Kailtyn were 20 months old I found myself pregnant!  I was VERY scared of having twins again.  We didn't have a good experience with pregnancy/birth/they were prem and never slept or fed well.  Lucky for us, we had a singleton.  There was 2yrs,4mths between them.  I would have liked a bigger age gap, but as they're all getting older I'm glad for a smaller one, so it's kinda short term pain, for long term gain.  I agree with a PP who said it depends a lot on the personality and habits of your kids, and the parents!  None of my kids have been good sleepers so that doesn't help... Oh.  And.  YES!  Am suitably impressed with your twin DD's weights How brilliant! (my two were 1.5 and 1.6kgs )   Edited by Butterscotch, 30 August 2009 - 08:41 AM.

I have no known family history of twins either and no fertility tx/meds ever. My husband always jokes we would end up with triplets if we had another pregnancy. Odds are higher than the general population for another set of fraternals. I guess the only way to find out is to try for another baby. Just kinda freaks me out that there are even moms that don't have a strong family history of multiples and no fertility treatments end up with two sets. Amazing!!! Congrats!

This is because most women who conceive fraternals (without fertility drugs) show a pattern of releasing more than one egg per cycle. Your chance of a second set numerically, is about 1 in 3000 The odds of having one set of identicals and one set of fraternals is 1 in 10,000. If a woman has one set of identicals, her chance of having another is 1 in 70,000 or less. The odds of having 3 sets of twins, of any kind, is 1 in 500,000.

Most likely the 2nd and maybe even 3rd pregnancy would be singles. twins after twins typically occur 2-3 pregnancies apart. I had b/g twins Feb 2009 and when I found out Nov 2009 I was pregnant again, I freaked out and spoke to a specialist and he assured me that, although it is possible, it is not very likely at all. He said to beware though the next pregnancy. Some people say that they can ONLY have twins, but even this is not true. It may be true that they ONLY ovulate multiple eggs but that does not even mean that each egg will be fertilized and implant. The chances of even one ovulated egg being fertilized and implanting to become and embryo is still not 100% so much less so is it that 2 or more would be. That is another reason twins are not so common as singletons. You should be fine. Of course, as everything else in life, it is never guaranteed, but your chances are tremendously higher of having a single birth this time around. But like my specialist told me...if you have another after this one, don't be surprised to see 2 again! GL! oh and by the way, I am only having 1 this time!

As I understand it if your twins are identical, you are no more likely than anyone else to have more twins - it is non identical twins that are genetic, and are therefore more likely to be repeated - that said, I do know of a fair few execeptions to this 'apparent' rule!

I heard that you have a 1 in 12 chance of having another set of twins if you have non-ID twins. If you have ID twins then they don't run in families so you have as much chance of having ID's as anyone else so it's about 1 in 250 chance. Having said that I know of 2 ladies who had ID twins first and are either pregnant with or are have a set of non-ID's. Apparently it is a 1 in a million chance of having ID's followed by non-ID's. I know 2 ladies who had non-ID's first and then went on to have ID's and another lady who has non-ID's and is pregnant with her 2nd set of non-ID's    Mummy to gorgeous ID twin boys born June 2009 at 36 weeks        Reply With Quote             12-12-15, 03:17    #12        Becc S    View Profile    View Forum Posts       Member         Join Date  May 2015  Location  wolverhampton  Posts  142          I have 11 month old twins boy & girl & love to have more twins lol my pregnancy was so nice tho. worst part was the sickness & the hotness (that was it lol) especial in the middle of winter I was getting looked at like I was crazy cuz I war vest tops while it was snowing no coat or jumper lol but I wad so dam bloody hot lol          Reply With Quote             26-12-15, 22:53    #13           Fiona F(318)    View Profile    View Forum Posts       Member         Join Date  Mar 2015  Location  Cwmbran  Posts  83          I have non identical twin boys and was told that there is a 1 in 12 chance of having twins again, but this can increase if you're over 30 and/or overweight apparently.

If you have identical twins you are no more likely to have twins then anybody else as the splitting of an egg is just a fluke. Anybody over 30 is more likely to have twins as your body may release two or more eggs to help increase your chances of getting pregnant as (in nature terms) time might be running out to get pregnant.
