Hide Caption 29 of 29 Story highlights Only 1 in 5 people will develop any symptoms; symptoms are typically mild and temporary There is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection (CNN) The Zika virus was discovered nearly 70 years ago, but chances are you probably hadn't heard of it until the past few months. With fear and uncertainty spreading as quickly as the virus itself, CNN Health wanted to address some of your pressing questions on the topic. To stay informed on the latest Zika news and most up-to-date information, bookmark: CNN.com/Zika . Should I be worried about Zika? The Zika virus is part of the same family as yellow fever , West Nile , chikungunya and dengue . But there is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection. Read More Even though symptoms are most often mild, Zika is commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly , a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. It causes severe developmental issues and, in some cases, can result in death. What are the chances I'll get the Zika virus? The virus is most commonly transmitted when an Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a person with an active infection and then spreads the virus by biting others. Originally discovered in a Ugandan forest, the aggressive mosquito is now predominantly raising concerns in Central and South America. If there are no infected mosquitoes in your area, you're very unlikely to contract the disease. Zika has been sexually transmitted in Texas, CDC confirms On February 2, the CDC confirmed the first case of sexually transmitted Zika in the latest outbreak. A male patient who had recently returned from Venezuela infected with Zika returned to the United States and infected his sexual partner, who had not traveled. The CDC issued interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus and noted that "there have been no reports of sexual transmission of Zika virus from infected women to their sex partners." "Until we know more, if your male sexual partner has traveled to or lives in an area with active Zika virus transmission, you should abstain from sex or use condoms the right way every time you have vaginal, anal and oral sex for the duration of the pregnancy," the updated guidance says. CDC issues new safe-sex guidelines around Zika virus While the virus has been documented in breast milk, saliva and urine, it has not yet been confirmed if the virus can be transmitted through any bodily fluids other than blood. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta , "There have been isolated cases of spread through blood transfusion or sexual contact and that's not very surprising. The virus is in the blood for about a week. How long it would remain in the semen is something that needs to be studied and we're working on that now." Frieden said that studies on sexual transmission are not easy studies to do, but the CDC is continuing to explore that avenue of transmission. "What we know is the vast majority of spread is going to be from mosquitoes," Frieden said. "The bottom line is mosquitoes are the real culprit here." What are the symptoms and effects? Only about one in five people infected with Zika virus will actually become ill, according to the CDC . "The most common symptoms of Zika are fever are rash, joint pain or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other symptoms include muscle pain and headache," the CDC says. For most people, the illness is mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. People don't usually get sick enough to require a hospital visit, and the virus very rarely results in death. JUST WATCHED What is the Zika virus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the Zika virus?  01:32 More seriously, Zika has been linked the birth defect microcephaly, as well as Guillain-Barré , a rare syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves. It's important to note: a link does not necessarily indicate cause and effect. Aside from either of these conditions, there are no lasting, long-term effects of Zika. Additionally, once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections, according to the CDC. What should I do if I think I've been exposed? If you think you may have been exposed to the Zika virus, stop and ask yourself these three questions: 1. Are you pregnant? 2. Are you a woman who is thinking about getting pregnant? 3. Are you a man who is going to have unprotected sex with a woman who is pregnant or may become pregnant? If your answer to all of these questions is "no," there is arguably no reason for you to get tested. Remember, only 20% people who contract the virus will even develop any symptoms, and those who do will experience only mild and short-lived discomfort. If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, however, you should contact your doctor about being tested for Zika. He or she can order blood tests to look for Zika or other similar viral diseases, such as dengue or chikungunya. A blood test performed in a clinical setting is the only way to be definitively diagnosed. How I can I be treated if I have the Zika virus? Unfortunately, as of now, there is no vaccine or specific medicine to treat Zika virus infections. Instead, the CDC recommends treating the symptoms: -- Get plenty of rest. -- Drink fluids to prevent dehydration. -- Take medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce fever and pain. -- Do not take aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If you are taking medicine for another medical condition, talk to your health care provider before taking additional medication. How can I keep myself safe in the U.S. or abroad? How to keep away mosquitoes carrying Zika, dengue With no vaccine available, the only protection against Zika is to avoid traveling to areas with an active infestation. If you do travel to a country where Zika is present, the CDC advises strict adherence to mosquito protection measures: Use an EPA-approved repellent over sunscreen, wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts thick enough to block a mosquito bite, and sleep in an air-conditioned, screened room. If you have Zika, you can keep from spreading it to others by avoiding mosquito bites during the first week of illness, the CDC said. The female Aedes aegypti, the primary carrier of Zika, is an aggressive biter, preferring daytime to dusk and indoors to outdoors. Keeping screens on windows and doors is critical to preventing entry to homes and hotel rooms.

By Alexandra Sifferlin  June 23, 2017        TIME Health  For more, visit TIME Health .   Last summer, public health experts were on high alert due to the rapid spread of the Zika virus , which has now been proven to cause birth defects and other health problems in infants. Today, experts know far more about the virus than they did at the start of the outbreak. Here’s what you need to know now about Zika.  Should pregnant women worry about Zika while traveling?  Short answer: yes. “Our general advice is that if you are pregnant, you should not go to places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing,” says Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “It’s all a matter of risk. Obviously, if you are staying in an air-conditioned hotel, your risk may be less. However, are you willing to take that risk? We know the consequences of infection of the fetus are huge and lifelong.”      Petersen recommends people check the CDC website for guidance on what locations have active Zika transmission. The CDC updates this list regularly, sometimes on a daily basis. If an area is no longer on the list, Petersen says it’s considered safe to travel. Currently, the CDC recommends that if a pregnant woman or her partner travel to an area with Zika, the couple should use condoms every time they have sex or avoid sex for the rest of the pregnancy, even if they do not have symptoms of Zika.

View Sample    Sign Up Now     Should women who plan to get pregnant avoid traveling to places with Zika?  Women who are planning to get pregnant, and their partners, should also pay attention to where they are traveling. The first trimester, during which women may not know they are pregnant, appears to be the most risky time when it comes to Zika-related health complications for infants down the line.    The CDC recommends that women who travel to areas with Zika who want to get pregnant in the near future wait at least eight weeks after their last possible exposure to the virus before trying to conceive. For male partners, the CDC advises waiting six months after the last possible exposure before trying to conceive. Using condoms is also recommended for the waiting period.  What if I am invited to a destination wedding in a place with Zika? Should I not go?  It may be challenging to get a firm yes or no from your doctor about whether or not you should travel for a major event, though the recommendations are not to go to places with active Zika transmission if you’re pregnant or want to be soon. “My job is to give guidance; I never tell people what to do,” says Dr. Richard Beigi, the chief medical officer of the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “But I think the travel warnings are there for a reason, and nothing has changed from last year other than the fact that we have more information that has validated that Zika causes congenital health problems. The overall risk is the same.”      Deciding to travel despite the risk is ultimately a personal decision. “I ask my patients, ‘Do you really need to go?’ For some people, the answer to that is yes, and that’s fine, and I give them the best advice I can,” Beigi says.  Should I worry about traveling to places that have the types of mosquitoes that can spread Zika?  The CDC recently reported that the types of mosquito that carry Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , are appearing in more counties in the southern U.S. where they haven’t been before. But unless the mosquitoes are transmitting Zika, there’s a “very, very, very low risk,” Petersen says. “In all of the places where we have this kind of mosquito that can spread Zika virus, we also see the kinds of mosquitoes that can spread West Nile and other diseases,” says Petersen. “General mosquito precautions in the summer are important for everybody—not only pregnant women.”      How likely is it that I will get Zika?  Experts can’t give a definitive answer to a person’s chances of getting Zika if they travel to a place that has reported spread of the disease. But experts are getting closer to understanding the likelihood of adverse events should a pregnant woman get infected.  A recent study found that one in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. with a Zika infection had a baby with brain damage or other serious birth defects. The first trimester was the most critical time: 15% of women with confirmed Zika infection in the first trimester had babies with birth defects. Another study found similar numbers for women in U.S. territories, revealing that during their first trimester, nearly 1 in 12 had a baby or fetus with Zika-associated birth defects.      “Out of the data collected, it appears that 5-10% of the time a woman gets Zika during her pregnancy, there will be in impact,” says Beigi. “Most of the impact is a malfunction; some of it is miscarriage. Probably the absolute risk of you having a problem is not very big, but it’s not zero, and it’s hard to know.”  How bad will Zika get in the U.S. this summer?  It’s unclear how many cases of Zika will be expected in and outside the U.S. this summer, though experts say it could be lower than last year. “Based on historical evidence, we would expect that outbreaks this year throughout the Western Hemisphere are going to be less than they were the year before,” says Petersen. “It’s not going away, but since a lot of people have already been infected and are no longer susceptible to infection, it will lower the number of cases over time.”  So far in 2017, about 650 Americans have gotten Zika, though that it is considered an underestimate. Most people do not experience symptoms and will not know they have the virus.

All the reported cases of Zika in the United States   U.S. southern states seem especially vulnerable to the spread of Zika because of the warm, humid climate and pockets of poverty where Americans live without window screens and air conditioning.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

INA FASSBENDER / Reuters Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE First Zika-Related Death in U.S. Reported in Puerto Rico 02:37 Zika virus has killed a man in Puerto Rico. The man, in his 70s, is the first reported U.S. death from the virus, which is spreading across the Americas. Zika is not usually thought of as a life-threatening virus. Here are some answers to questions about how Zika affects people: Is Zika a killer virus? No one thought so until recently. Zika was mostly known for causing almost no symptoms at all in most people who get it. At worst, it usually causes rashes, headache, maybe a fever and maybe muscle aches and, sometimes, conjunctivitis. But as the virus infects hundreds of thousands of people all at once, it’s causing a range of symptoms never seen before. The most frightening are severe and even catastrophic birth defects, mostly affecting the brain. Some of these have resulted in miscarriages, and some of the babies have died soon after birth. Brazil and Colombia have each reported a handful of deaths in adults who had Zika. Colombia said three people died with Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can be caused by Zika, in February.  New Map Finds 2 Billion People At Risk of Zika Virus  eLife, Oxford University and the University of Washington How can it kill? The patient who died in Puerto Rico had a very rare complication called immune thrombocytopenic purpura. It’s caused after an infection, when the immune system cells that were attacking the virus turn on the body’s own blood platelets, destroying them. Patients can suffer bleeding and shock. In this case the patient, who had other health conditions, died. Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, another auto-immune reaction caused when the immune system gets mixed up after an infection. In this case it attacks the nerves and can cause sometimes severe paralysis. Usually patients recover but it kills about 1 percent of victims. And the birth defects are certainly deadly. When a baby has severe brain damage, it can die while still in the womb or at birth. A few women have opted for early abortions to avoid carrying a child that’s doomed. Babies have died of other, unknown causes when the mother’s been infected with Zika. Zika can also cause other dangerous nerve conditions in adults. One is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. It's an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that damages the protective fatty myelin layer that covers nerve cells. Are there treatments? There are no specific treatments for Zika infection and there’s no known way to reverse damage done to a developing baby. A vaccine is in the works but would be years away from the market. People with symptoms can ease the discomfort with acetaminophen. Because of the bleeding risk, doctors often advise staying away from aspirin or ibuprofen. How far will it spread? Zika’s already spreading in more than 40 countries — all tropical countries so far, because the main carrier is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which thrives in tropical places. But it's expected to hit the southern U.S. in the coming months, when Aedes mosquitoes really start to breed as weather warms. Zika is spreading across Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as in the South Pacific, and CDC just issued a warning that Zika is spreading in Papua New Guinea. Mexican researchers have found evidence that a cousin of Aedes aegypti called Aedes albopictus, or the Asian tiger mosquito, is also carrying Zika. If that species starts spreading Zika it’s possible there could be more cases in more temperate areas. How can I avoid getting it? Avoid mosquitoes. The CDC recommends that pregnant women and anyone else who wants to avoid getting it stay away from areas where Zika is spreading. The CDC is also advising states where Zika-carrying mosquitoes can breed — mostly in the South but as far north as New York – to get their mosquito control efforts into gear . Repellents such as DEET are safe for all but the youngest infants. Long sleeves and pants can protect, and screens and air conditioning thwart most of the mosquitoes that carry the virus. The CDC doesn’t expect much spread of Zika in the continental U.S., however. To cause large-scale spread you need both a large number of infected people and a large number of infected mosquitoes. Zika's also spread sexually, so the CDC recommends that anyone who has symptoms of Zika and reason to believe they could be infected should use a condom. Pregnant women should use condoms if there's even a chance their sexual partner could be infected. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .

For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE At least 10 percent of babies born to women infected with Zika virus have been diagnosed with visible birth defects, federal researchers reported Tuesday. And 15 percent of women infected during the first trimester of pregnancy end up with affected babies, the team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE In Texas, Pregnant and Scared of Zika 02:32 That’s just visible defects. Some of the babies may have subtler birth defects that will only be seen as they grow, the CDC team said. It’s the latest and most complete look at the risk that Zika poses to pregnant women and their babies, and it shows the risk is high. “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States,” CDC acting director Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters. So far, 1,600 women infected with Zika are or have been pregnant in the 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. Related: Zika Raises Birth Defect Rate 20 Times “We do know this devastating outbreak is far from over and the consequences of this outbreak are heartbreaking.” More than 1,000 pregnant women who tested positive for Zika virus or had suspected Zika infections either gave birth, had a miscarriage or an abortion in 2016. The CDC team and state health officials took a detailed look at the cases. “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States." “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States." Of all the women, 51 of the women or 5 percent had a baby with some sort of Zika-related birth defect, ranging from microcephaly — the small head that’s the hallmark of Zika and that’s caused by brain damage — to other brain damage or neurological birth defect. Among women whose Zika was confirmed by lab test, 10 percent had a baby or fetus with a Zika-related birth defect. “That proportion increased to 15 percent for women with confirmed Zika during their first trimester,” Schuchat said. The last estimate showed 6 percent of babies or fetuses were affected. That’s probably not the full range of damage, Schuchat added. “Some seemingly healthy babies born following pregnancies complicated by Zika may have developmental problems that become evident months after birth,” she said. Zika is known to cause a range of birth defects . The first to be noticed was microcephaly, but now doctors have seen other profound defects, such as collapsed skulls and other deformities, as well as milder problems, such as eye defects. Related:  Zika-Affected Babies Can Cry 24 Hours a Day “Some babies may have seizures while other babies may have problems controlling their arms and legs,” Schuchat said. “Some babies cry constantly and are inconsolable no matter what their caregiver does,” she added. Others have trouble swallowing or controlling their arms and legs. It could cost $4 million or more to care for a Zika-affected child, the CDC estimates. Zika is mostly carried by travelers to the United States, but the virus has been spread in Florida by local mosquitoes, and there have been a few home-grown cases in south Texas, as well. Any place that has the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika could see local outbreaks. Before Zika, the birth defect rate in the U.S. was about 2.9 per 1,000 live births. “The initial findings from the U.S. Zika virus pregnancy registry represent an approximate twentyfold increase in Zika virus–associated birth defects among pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection, with an approximate thirtyfold increase in brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly,” the CDC and state researchers wrote in their report. “Every mosquito bite carries a risk." “Every mosquito bite carries a risk." Pregnant women or women who could become pregnant should stay away from any place where Zika is spreading, the CDC and World Health Organization says. If they cannot stay away, they should use insect repellent, clothing and other measures to prevent mosquito bites, and condoms to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. Related: Study to Track 10,000 Pregnant Women And pregnant women with any chance of Zika infection need regular scans to see if their baby is affected — and any babies born need an ultrasound or CT scan to check for birth defects. Only 25 percent of the women whose babies were affected got those scans, the CDC said. It’s not clear why not — it could be a health insurance issue — Schuchat said the CDC also believes that all doctors still do not understand the need for such scans. “These findings underscore the serious risk for birth defects posed by Zika virus infection during pregnancy and highlight why pregnant women should avoid Zika virus exposure and that all pregnant women should be screened for possible Zika virus exposure at every prenatal visit,” the CDC team, led by Dr. Margaret Honein, wrote. “Zika is still with us. We don’t know how much transmission there will be this year,” Schuchat said. “Every mosquito bite carries a risk,” she added. “We cannot afford to be complacent when a single bite from a Zika-affected mosquito can lead to such a devastating condition.” Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Why? A sudden surge in Brazilian babies born with microcephaly – a birth defect caused by the Zika infection during pregnancy – sparked massive concern and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a public health emergency. The disease is also linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis.  But there’s an added twist that makes this situation even more complex: Brazil, the country at the center of the current Zika crisis, is slated to host nearly 500,000 visitors this summer. Media attention on the problem has exploded, and experts are even debating whether visitors and athletes should make the trip.  At Casino.org, we’re very familiar with odds – so we decided to calculate the likelihood of the average person contracting Zika this summer in Rio. How does the risk of Zika compare with the risk of other illnesses and accidents? What percentage of the U.S. population currently has the disease? And what are the real odds of catching Zika in Rio this summer? Is the Zika/Rio debate truly a global health crisis – or a case of media hype? Read on to get the full story.    What Do You Have a Greater Chance of Dying From?  So you’ve booked your flight to Rio, and planned your accommodations. What’s the likelihood that you’ll make it back home without catching Zika? Pretty decent: 99.999996 percent.   Another way to gain perspective is to compare your 0.000004 percent chance of contracting Zika in Rio this summer with the odds of dying from various other conditions. Only one person has died in the continental U.S. from Zika as of July 11. You are more than twice as likely to die from legal execution, 73 times more likely to die from choking on food, and over 2,212 times more likely to die in an automobile crash than to even contract Zika in Rio.     How Many Times More Likely Is ...  Should you head to Brazil this summer, you can rest easy when it comes to worrying about Zika: You only have a 1 in 250,000 chance of contracting the virus. By our reckoning, you have a lot more to worry about before you stress about that.   You're thousands of times more likely to die from an auto accident than you are likely to contract Zika in Rio. You’re also hundreds of times more likely to die from a shooting or drowning. Even the most random fatal accidents are more probable: Falling, air accidents, and even lightning strikes should worry you more than contracting Zika.     Zika Infections Across the Country  Zika is making headlines across the United States and around the globe – so we took a look at actual known cases of the virus among people within the United States . First of all, every known case of Zika in the U.S. is associated with travel to an outbreak area or sex with an infected person – there are no known cases of Zika caused by a mosquito bite on American soil as of July 11.  Washington, D.C., tops the list for highest percentage of Zika cases: 0.000893 percent of the population has contracted the disease. New York, Hawaii, and Florida have the next highest rates. In five states – Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, and Alaska – there are no known cases of Zika at all.     Comparing Zika With Ebola, Malaria, and Other Diseases  Zika is constantly being discussed in the media, but how does it compare to other buzzed-about diseases? In the past decade, Ebola, malaria, and the West Nile virus have had just as much media coverage. In 2014, the United States was in an Ebola panic , and many were afraid they would contract Ebola.   While it’s 53 times more likely a resident of the United States will contract Zika over Ebola, those odds were during Ebola’s peak in 2014 and the Zika odds require a trip to Rio this summer. Here in the U.S., your odds of contracting Ebola and Zika are slim, and you are much more likely of contracting a severe form of West Nile disease or even malaria. Your best bet? Wear bug spray and see a doctor if you display any symptoms.    Contracting Zika or Dengue Fever in Rio  As we’ve discovered, the likelihood of contracting Zika this summer isn’t particularly high. It’s much more likely you’d catch a cold or some other common illness from someone beside you in the stands. But what about another mosquito-borne disease?  Dengue fever is a major risk for people who reside in the tropics and subtropics. It is a leading cause of illness and even death in those regions. No vaccine exists, so the best protection is to simply avoid mosquito bites.   Of the nearly half a million projected visitors to Rio this summer, odds are that only two may contract Zika. On the other hand, chances are that about 279 Rio visitors could contract dengue fever.     What Else Is More Likely?  Asteroids. UFOs. Four-leaf clovers. They’re the stuff of dreams – or in some cases, nightmares. But, amazingly, you’re likelier to encounter one of these than you are to become a victim of Zika. For instance, a person is 25 times likelier to find a four-leaf clover on their first try than to contract Zika in Rio this summer.   In addition, a woman in the United States is 8 times more likely to spot a UFO than to give birth to a baby with microcephaly as a result of Zika contracted in Rio.    Calculating the Odds  As you can see, the odds of contracting Zika in Rio this summer are astronomically slim. However, the debate rages on .   Zika is a serious disease, and even one case is a case too many. However, of those who become infected, 8 in 10 don’t even display symptoms, and the remaining 2 in 10 usually aren’t ill enough to require medical treatment. Zika’s greatest danger, by far, is to pregnant women.  It’s always important to do the research, weigh the risks, and calculate the odds.

Lourdes Health System    Administration         Your risk of contracting the Zika virus is very, very low. In fact, many people who contract Zika may not even realize it. So far, there is no mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika virus within the United States, so most screening efforts are looking to see if a person has traveled to an area where it is endemic. Zika is contracted by mosquitoes in Puerto Rico and Central and South America. So, doctors are screening for Zika to see if a person or a sexual partner has been in one of these territories. The tricky part is that the incubation time of the virus is between three and seven days. So, you might come back from a vacation or a conference and show no signs yet.

The Zika virus has been seen in Mexico, Central America, South America, Puerto Rico and on several Caribbean islands. Anyone traveling to these areas may come in contact with the Zika virus. You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites. In the U.S, the Zika virus has so far been found only in limited areas in Florida, although people who have come in contact with the virus elsewhere have returned to country with the infection. (This is called a travel-associated case.)                   Khang N. Tran, MD on behalf of Medical City Plano    Internal Medicine         Only 1 in 5 people bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika will actually get Zika. A person may not become infected -- possibly because their immune system was on overdrive that day, or the amount of the virus carried by the mosquito was very small.

For women living in areas where the mosquito-borne virus is spreading, who are trying to make the huge decision of whether, and when, to have a child, there’s not a lot to go on. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women who’ve gotten Zika should wait at least eight weeks to conceive, and that men who’ve gotten it should wait at least six months. But the vast majority of people who are infected with Zika don’t show any symptoms, and children can still be born with birth defects and mothers can still miscarry, even if they never had symptoms. So it’s possible that microcephaly—a birth defect caused by Zika that leads to smaller-than-average head size and other developmental problems—could sneak up on parents who never knew one of them had Zika in the first place. Margaret Chan, the director of the World Health Organization, summed up the harsh reality of the situation in her recent address to the 69th World Health Assembly : “To protect women of childbearing age, all we can offer is advice. Avoid mosquito bites. Delay pregnancy. Do not travel to areas with ongoing transmission.” If a woman is infected in her first trimester, there is between a 1 and 13 percent chance of her fetus developing microcephaly. This is not the most reassuring advice. But a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates how likely it is that the fetus of a woman infected with Zika would develop microcephaly, offering would-be parents at least some idea of the risk they’d be taking on. Analyzing current outbreak data from the Brazilian state of Bahia, researchers from the CDC calculated that if a woman is infected in her first trimester, there is between a 1  and 13 percent chance of her fetus developing microcephaly. Related Stories      Zika Is a Delayed Epidemic   When in Pregnancy Is Zika Most Dangerous?   The Count of American Zika Cases Just Got Bigger   That’s a big range! We have Zika’s stealthy nature to thank for that. The first number is based on the assumption that the Zika infection rate in Bahia’s population is 80 percent and that half the cases of microcephaly reported are false. The second presumes a 10 percent infection rate and that every case reported is true. There’s probably been at least some overreporting of microcephaly in Brazil, and since many people don’t show symptoms and don’t get tested, the actual infection rate is hard to pin down. So we don’t know where in that range the truth lies. A previous analysis of the 2013-2014 Zika outbreak in French Polynesia found about a 1 percent risk—but the microcephaly cases there were found retrospectively, so that might be on the low side. Some important caveats—this study only looked at first-trimester infection, and infection at all stages of pregnancy has been associated with fetal abnormalities and other pregnancy problems. And it also only looked at microcephaly specifically. “Microcephaly is only one possible adverse outcome among a spectrum of conditions that may be part of congenital Zika syndrome,” the researchers write. Still, at least we now have a risk estimate to offer women, along with advice.

Twitter                 Most Popular  Presented by               Jonathan Ernst / Reuters   Michael Cohen Has a Big Problem    Adam Serwer    It takes strong evidence to execute a search warrant against an attorney representing a subject in a federal investigation, let alone the president’s personal counsel.   Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Why the GOP Is Making the Midterm Elections All About Impeachment    David Frum      It may be a counterintuitive gambit, but Republicans are betting it will pay off.   To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

The number of U.S. women infected by the Zika virus is getting crazy high  Here's how to protect yourself.          Mandy Velez     @mandy_velez         May 26, 2016 10:28 AM    #World                                       You may want to grab the bug spray if you plan on taking a trip or going outside this summer. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the Zika virus — a mosquito-born illness that originated in South America — has infected almost 300 pregnant women since it came to the United States, according to the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry, which documents mothers and babies post-Zika diagnosis. This is not-so-great news considering the virus can cause serious birth defects for babies born to infected mothers. But if you aren't pregnant, or don't plan on becoming pregnant for a while, don't panic. Here's some things you should know:               photo:
                                
                                    iStock                     1. The Zika virus is spread through mosquitos or sexual intercourse, so wear bug spray and condoms.   CBS reports that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents, like those with DEET or Picaridin are your best bet. Here are top-rated ones by Consumer Reports. Pro-tip: You want to apply the repellent after you put on sunscreen.       2. Most people don't even know they have the virus.   The virus can spread before symptoms exhibit themselves, so people can have it without even knowing.        3. If you're not pregnant, you'll just get feverish. Then you'll be fine.   Common symptoms include fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis . If you experience any of these after traveling to an infected area, see a doctor. While people have died from complications from the virus, it's rare. Unless you're older, immune-compromised, or go untreated while symptomatic, you will be okay.       4. Still, men who have been in infected areas can pass on the virus in their semen, so make sure he wraps it.   It's unclear whether women can pass on the virus, but men definitely can . Any guy who went to an infected area should use a condom.        5. If you do get infected and you're not trying to get pregnant, it won't affect any future pregnancies.   The virus clears the blood stream in a week's time, so if you have zero plans on bringing life into this world, don't sweat it . There is no evidence to support future pregnancies would be affected.       6. Before vacay, check to see if the virus is in the place you're visiting to be extra careful.   The CDC has a list of places with documented reports of the virus, including many vacay favs, including Mexico, Belize, and Puerto Rico among others . As stated above, wear that bug repellent, and wrap up before sleeping with a sexy stranger.        7. But if you are pregnant, or trying to be, avoid traveling to Zika virus-infected places.   Zika causes a birth defect called Microcephaly in infants, one of many brain abnormalities that can occur in pregnant women post-infection. So avoid these places altogether if you're already pregnant. But if you're traveling to an area while planning to get pregnant, wait at least eight weeks before trying to conceive.       8. There's currently no vaccine for this virus — but you can get a blood test from your doctor if you want.   Just stay away from mosquitos, and tell your pregnant friends the deal. If you suspect you're infected, ask you doctor for a blood test, which they'll send over to the CDC.         #World  #News  #US       Share This Story   SHARE THIS STORY ON FACEBOOK        ···   More      To share this article with others, copy and paste this link:   copy to clipboard     Recommended      We tried Walmart's upgraded clothing lines for all sizes       Too Faced is teasing a rainbow of metallic lipsticks, but fans aren't happy       22 pure AF Captain America quotes       An infuriating new dress code bans hijabs for young girls            This Twitter thread perfectly explains how inaccurate BMI is           Get the latest from Revelist           Related       An airline just passed crazy waistline limits on passengers         Sephora has a real life theme park — but there's a major catch         This artist gives world leaders hipster makeovers                        Most Popular      Sprousehart was caught kissing in Paris, and Twitter is losing its chill       Here's everything in Vlada MUA's rose gold Smashbox collection       This bold workwear line goes up to a size 32       Tear-jerking celebrity reactions to Cardi B's pregnancy       This lookalike may have actually body-snatched Kim Kardashian     Featured Writers       I tried Ashley Nell Tipton's plus-size jewelry line — here's the verdict  Jessica Torres         What happened to Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics?

That's just one way health officials are battling back Zika-carrying mosquitoes in the area.  Joe Raedle/Getty Images     As expected, the Zika outbreak in Florida is growing — though how fast is still difficult to say.  State and federal health officials  say mosquitoes are spreading Zika in two neighborhoods of Miami, including Miami Beach. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told pregnant women Friday not to go into these neighborhoods — and to consider postponing travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County.  Just 37 people have been reported to have  caught the virus in these neighborhoods so far.  But many scientists are concerned that the outbreak in Florida may be larger and more widespread than the number of cases suggests.  "Zika is one of those diseases that is always like an iceberg — you just see the tip," says Alessandro Vespignani , a computer scientist at Northeastern University in Boston, who has been tasked with modeling the spread of the virus.  Most people who get Zika don't even know they have it, Vespignani explains. About 4 in 5 people don't have any symptoms, he says. And those who do get sick often have only mild symptoms that could be confused with the flu. So only about 5 percent of cases get detected, Vespignani has found .     To get better estimates of the number of silent infections in Miami and beyond, Vespignani and his colleagues built computer models that estimate how the virus is likely to spread.  "We estimate there will be 395 infected people by Sept. 15 [in Florida]," says Ira Longini , a biostatistician at the University of Florida, who collaborates with Vespignani.  About 80 of those people will show symptoms, Longini estimates. And about eight pregnant women are likely to get infected during their first trimester — which would put their fetuses at risk for microcephaly.  The number of Zika cases in Florida will very likely continue to rise until October or November, when cooler weather stops the mosquitoes, Longini says, though a number of variables could speed the spread before that.  " For example, on Monday the University of Florida opens its first day of classes," he says. "Tens of thousands of students will be coming from the Miami area, as well as from all over Latin America. So we could see a burst of cases by mid-September here in Gainesville."  Because of these uncertainties, many doctors around the country are recommending that their pregnant patients — and those trying to get pregnant — not travel to southern Florida.  And Florida isn't the only place in the continental U.S. at risk.  Longini has used the computer models to predict where Zika could show up next in the States. He says the big concern is Texas — which has roughly a 25 percent chance of having a small outbreak in the next month, according to the models.  "I would not be surprised if we see cases in Texas and Louisiana," Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told  ABC News Sunday, citing the flooding in Louisiana as something Zika watchers will be keeping an eye on.  "There's going to be a lot of problems getting rid of standing water [there]," Fauci says — puddles where Zika-carrying mosquitoes could breed and thrive.     zika  pregnant women  mathematical modeling  Miami  STD  Florida       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

Hide Caption 29 of 29 Story highlights Only 1 in 5 people will develop any symptoms; symptoms are typically mild and temporary There is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection (CNN) The Zika virus was discovered nearly 70 years ago, but chances are you probably hadn't heard of it until the past few months. With fear and uncertainty spreading as quickly as the virus itself, CNN Health wanted to address some of your pressing questions on the topic. To stay informed on the latest Zika news and most up-to-date information, bookmark: CNN.com/Zika . Should I be worried about Zika? The Zika virus is part of the same family as yellow fever , West Nile , chikungunya and dengue . But there is no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat the infection. Read More Even though symptoms are most often mild, Zika is commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly , a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. It causes severe developmental issues and, in some cases, can result in death. What are the chances I'll get the Zika virus? The virus is most commonly transmitted when an Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a person with an active infection and then spreads the virus by biting others. Originally discovered in a Ugandan forest, the aggressive mosquito is now predominantly raising concerns in Central and South America. If there are no infected mosquitoes in your area, you're very unlikely to contract the disease. Zika has been sexually transmitted in Texas, CDC confirms On February 2, the CDC confirmed the first case of sexually transmitted Zika in the latest outbreak. A male patient who had recently returned from Venezuela infected with Zika returned to the United States and infected his sexual partner, who had not traveled. The CDC issued interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus and noted that "there have been no reports of sexual transmission of Zika virus from infected women to their sex partners." "Until we know more, if your male sexual partner has traveled to or lives in an area with active Zika virus transmission, you should abstain from sex or use condoms the right way every time you have vaginal, anal and oral sex for the duration of the pregnancy," the updated guidance says. CDC issues new safe-sex guidelines around Zika virus While the virus has been documented in breast milk, saliva and urine, it has not yet been confirmed if the virus can be transmitted through any bodily fluids other than blood. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta , "There have been isolated cases of spread through blood transfusion or sexual contact and that's not very surprising. The virus is in the blood for about a week. How long it would remain in the semen is something that needs to be studied and we're working on that now." Frieden said that studies on sexual transmission are not easy studies to do, but the CDC is continuing to explore that avenue of transmission. "What we know is the vast majority of spread is going to be from mosquitoes," Frieden said. "The bottom line is mosquitoes are the real culprit here." What are the symptoms and effects? Only about one in five people infected with Zika virus will actually become ill, according to the CDC . "The most common symptoms of Zika are fever are rash, joint pain or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other symptoms include muscle pain and headache," the CDC says. For most people, the illness is mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. People don't usually get sick enough to require a hospital visit, and the virus very rarely results in death. JUST WATCHED What is the Zika virus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the Zika virus?  01:32 More seriously, Zika has been linked the birth defect microcephaly, as well as Guillain-Barré , a rare syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves. It's important to note: a link does not necessarily indicate cause and effect. Aside from either of these conditions, there are no lasting, long-term effects of Zika. Additionally, once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections, according to the CDC. What should I do if I think I've been exposed? If you think you may have been exposed to the Zika virus, stop and ask yourself these three questions: 1. Are you pregnant? 2. Are you a woman who is thinking about getting pregnant? 3. Are you a man who is going to have unprotected sex with a woman who is pregnant or may become pregnant? If your answer to all of these questions is "no," there is arguably no reason for you to get tested. Remember, only 20% people who contract the virus will even develop any symptoms, and those who do will experience only mild and short-lived discomfort. If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, however, you should contact your doctor about being tested for Zika. He or she can order blood tests to look for Zika or other similar viral diseases, such as dengue or chikungunya. A blood test performed in a clinical setting is the only way to be definitively diagnosed. How I can I be treated if I have the Zika virus? Unfortunately, as of now, there is no vaccine or specific medicine to treat Zika virus infections. Instead, the CDC recommends treating the symptoms: -- Get plenty of rest. -- Drink fluids to prevent dehydration. -- Take medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce fever and pain. -- Do not take aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If you are taking medicine for another medical condition, talk to your health care provider before taking additional medication. How can I keep myself safe in the U.S. or abroad? How to keep away mosquitoes carrying Zika, dengue With no vaccine available, the only protection against Zika is to avoid traveling to areas with an active infestation. If you do travel to a country where Zika is present, the CDC advises strict adherence to mosquito protection measures: Use an EPA-approved repellent over sunscreen, wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts thick enough to block a mosquito bite, and sleep in an air-conditioned, screened room. If you have Zika, you can keep from spreading it to others by avoiding mosquito bites during the first week of illness, the CDC said. The female Aedes aegypti, the primary carrier of Zika, is an aggressive biter, preferring daytime to dusk and indoors to outdoors. Keeping screens on windows and doors is critical to preventing entry to homes and hotel rooms.

By Alexandra Sifferlin  June 23, 2017        TIME Health  For more, visit TIME Health .   Last summer, public health experts were on high alert due to the rapid spread of the Zika virus , which has now been proven to cause birth defects and other health problems in infants. Today, experts know far more about the virus than they did at the start of the outbreak. Here’s what you need to know now about Zika.  Should pregnant women worry about Zika while traveling?  Short answer: yes. “Our general advice is that if you are pregnant, you should not go to places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing,” says Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “It’s all a matter of risk. Obviously, if you are staying in an air-conditioned hotel, your risk may be less. However, are you willing to take that risk? We know the consequences of infection of the fetus are huge and lifelong.”      Petersen recommends people check the CDC website for guidance on what locations have active Zika transmission. The CDC updates this list regularly, sometimes on a daily basis. If an area is no longer on the list, Petersen says it’s considered safe to travel. Currently, the CDC recommends that if a pregnant woman or her partner travel to an area with Zika, the couple should use condoms every time they have sex or avoid sex for the rest of the pregnancy, even if they do not have symptoms of Zika.

Women who are planning to get pregnant, and their partners, should also pay attention to where they are traveling. The first trimester, during which women may not know they are pregnant, appears to be the most risky time when it comes to Zika-related health complications for infants down the line.    The CDC recommends that women who travel to areas with Zika who want to get pregnant in the near future wait at least eight weeks after their last possible exposure to the virus before trying to conceive. For male partners, the CDC advises waiting six months after the last possible exposure before trying to conceive. Using condoms is also recommended for the waiting period.  What if I am invited to a destination wedding in a place with Zika? Should I not go?  It may be challenging to get a firm yes or no from your doctor about whether or not you should travel for a major event, though the recommendations are not to go to places with active Zika transmission if you’re pregnant or want to be soon. “My job is to give guidance; I never tell people what to do,” says Dr. Richard Beigi, the chief medical officer of the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “But I think the travel warnings are there for a reason, and nothing has changed from last year other than the fact that we have more information that has validated that Zika causes congenital health problems. The overall risk is the same.”      Deciding to travel despite the risk is ultimately a personal decision. “I ask my patients, ‘Do you really need to go?’ For some people, the answer to that is yes, and that’s fine, and I give them the best advice I can,” Beigi says.  Should I worry about traveling to places that have the types of mosquitoes that can spread Zika?  The CDC recently reported that the types of mosquito that carry Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , are appearing in more counties in the southern U.S. where they haven’t been before. But unless the mosquitoes are transmitting Zika, there’s a “very, very, very low risk,” Petersen says. “In all of the places where we have this kind of mosquito that can spread Zika virus, we also see the kinds of mosquitoes that can spread West Nile and other diseases,” says Petersen. “General mosquito precautions in the summer are important for everybody—not only pregnant women.”      How likely is it that I will get Zika?  Experts can’t give a definitive answer to a person’s chances of getting Zika if they travel to a place that has reported spread of the disease. But experts are getting closer to understanding the likelihood of adverse events should a pregnant woman get infected.  A recent study found that one in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. with a Zika infection had a baby with brain damage or other serious birth defects. The first trimester was the most critical time: 15% of women with confirmed Zika infection in the first trimester had babies with birth defects. Another study found similar numbers for women in U.S. territories, revealing that during their first trimester, nearly 1 in 12 had a baby or fetus with Zika-associated birth defects.      “Out of the data collected, it appears that 5-10% of the time a woman gets Zika during her pregnancy, there will be in impact,” says Beigi. “Most of the impact is a malfunction; some of it is miscarriage. Probably the absolute risk of you having a problem is not very big, but it’s not zero, and it’s hard to know.”  How bad will Zika get in the U.S. this summer?  It’s unclear how many cases of Zika will be expected in and outside the U.S. this summer, though experts say it could be lower than last year. “Based on historical evidence, we would expect that outbreaks this year throughout the Western Hemisphere are going to be less than they were the year before,” says Petersen. “It’s not going away, but since a lot of people have already been infected and are no longer susceptible to infection, it will lower the number of cases over time.”  So far in 2017, about 650 Americans have gotten Zika, though that it is considered an underestimate. Most people do not experience symptoms and will not know they have the virus.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

INA FASSBENDER / Reuters Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE First Zika-Related Death in U.S. Reported in Puerto Rico 02:37 Zika virus has killed a man in Puerto Rico. The man, in his 70s, is the first reported U.S. death from the virus, which is spreading across the Americas. Zika is not usually thought of as a life-threatening virus. Here are some answers to questions about how Zika affects people: Is Zika a killer virus? No one thought so until recently. Zika was mostly known for causing almost no symptoms at all in most people who get it. At worst, it usually causes rashes, headache, maybe a fever and maybe muscle aches and, sometimes, conjunctivitis. But as the virus infects hundreds of thousands of people all at once, it’s causing a range of symptoms never seen before. The most frightening are severe and even catastrophic birth defects, mostly affecting the brain. Some of these have resulted in miscarriages, and some of the babies have died soon after birth. Brazil and Colombia have each reported a handful of deaths in adults who had Zika. Colombia said three people died with Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can be caused by Zika, in February.  New Map Finds 2 Billion People At Risk of Zika Virus  eLife, Oxford University and the University of Washington How can it kill? The patient who died in Puerto Rico had a very rare complication called immune thrombocytopenic purpura. It’s caused after an infection, when the immune system cells that were attacking the virus turn on the body’s own blood platelets, destroying them. Patients can suffer bleeding and shock. In this case the patient, who had other health conditions, died. Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, another auto-immune reaction caused when the immune system gets mixed up after an infection. In this case it attacks the nerves and can cause sometimes severe paralysis. Usually patients recover but it kills about 1 percent of victims. And the birth defects are certainly deadly. When a baby has severe brain damage, it can die while still in the womb or at birth. A few women have opted for early abortions to avoid carrying a child that’s doomed. Babies have died of other, unknown causes when the mother’s been infected with Zika. Zika can also cause other dangerous nerve conditions in adults. One is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. It's an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that damages the protective fatty myelin layer that covers nerve cells. Are there treatments? There are no specific treatments for Zika infection and there’s no known way to reverse damage done to a developing baby. A vaccine is in the works but would be years away from the market. People with symptoms can ease the discomfort with acetaminophen. Because of the bleeding risk, doctors often advise staying away from aspirin or ibuprofen. How far will it spread? Zika’s already spreading in more than 40 countries — all tropical countries so far, because the main carrier is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which thrives in tropical places. But it's expected to hit the southern U.S. in the coming months, when Aedes mosquitoes really start to breed as weather warms. Zika is spreading across Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as in the South Pacific, and CDC just issued a warning that Zika is spreading in Papua New Guinea. Mexican researchers have found evidence that a cousin of Aedes aegypti called Aedes albopictus, or the Asian tiger mosquito, is also carrying Zika. If that species starts spreading Zika it’s possible there could be more cases in more temperate areas. How can I avoid getting it? Avoid mosquitoes. The CDC recommends that pregnant women and anyone else who wants to avoid getting it stay away from areas where Zika is spreading. The CDC is also advising states where Zika-carrying mosquitoes can breed — mostly in the South but as far north as New York – to get their mosquito control efforts into gear . Repellents such as DEET are safe for all but the youngest infants. Long sleeves and pants can protect, and screens and air conditioning thwart most of the mosquitoes that carry the virus. The CDC doesn’t expect much spread of Zika in the continental U.S., however. To cause large-scale spread you need both a large number of infected people and a large number of infected mosquitoes. Zika's also spread sexually, so the CDC recommends that anyone who has symptoms of Zika and reason to believe they could be infected should use a condom. Pregnant women should use condoms if there's even a chance their sexual partner could be infected. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She added, “We’ve become more concerned” about the period around the time of conception. “For people who either have the Zika disease or who travel to an area with active Zika transmission, we are now recommending they wait a period of time before trying to get pregnant.”     Zika Virus Rumors and Theories That You Should Doubt  Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.             For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

SUBSCRIBE At least 10 percent of babies born to women infected with Zika virus have been diagnosed with visible birth defects, federal researchers reported Tuesday. And 15 percent of women infected during the first trimester of pregnancy end up with affected babies, the team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE In Texas, Pregnant and Scared of Zika 02:32 That’s just visible defects. Some of the babies may have subtler birth defects that will only be seen as they grow, the CDC team said. It’s the latest and most complete look at the risk that Zika poses to pregnant women and their babies, and it shows the risk is high. “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States,” CDC acting director Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters. So far, 1,600 women infected with Zika are or have been pregnant in the 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. Related: Zika Raises Birth Defect Rate 20 Times “We do know this devastating outbreak is far from over and the consequences of this outbreak are heartbreaking.” More than 1,000 pregnant women who tested positive for Zika virus or had suspected Zika infections either gave birth, had a miscarriage or an abortion in 2016. The CDC team and state health officials took a detailed look at the cases. “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States." “We are still seeing about 30 to 40 new Zika cases in pregnant women each week in the United States." Of all the women, 51 of the women or 5 percent had a baby with some sort of Zika-related birth defect, ranging from microcephaly — the small head that’s the hallmark of Zika and that’s caused by brain damage — to other brain damage or neurological birth defect. Among women whose Zika was confirmed by lab test, 10 percent had a baby or fetus with a Zika-related birth defect. “That proportion increased to 15 percent for women with confirmed Zika during their first trimester,” Schuchat said. The last estimate showed 6 percent of babies or fetuses were affected. That’s probably not the full range of damage, Schuchat added. “Some seemingly healthy babies born following pregnancies complicated by Zika may have developmental problems that become evident months after birth,” she said. Zika is known to cause a range of birth defects . The first to be noticed was microcephaly, but now doctors have seen other profound defects, such as collapsed skulls and other deformities, as well as milder problems, such as eye defects. Related:  Zika-Affected Babies Can Cry 24 Hours a Day “Some babies may have seizures while other babies may have problems controlling their arms and legs,” Schuchat said. “Some babies cry constantly and are inconsolable no matter what their caregiver does,” she added. Others have trouble swallowing or controlling their arms and legs. It could cost $4 million or more to care for a Zika-affected child, the CDC estimates. Zika is mostly carried by travelers to the United States, but the virus has been spread in Florida by local mosquitoes, and there have been a few home-grown cases in south Texas, as well. Any place that has the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika could see local outbreaks. Before Zika, the birth defect rate in the U.S. was about 2.9 per 1,000 live births. “The initial findings from the U.S. Zika virus pregnancy registry represent an approximate twentyfold increase in Zika virus–associated birth defects among pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection, with an approximate thirtyfold increase in brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly,” the CDC and state researchers wrote in their report. “Every mosquito bite carries a risk." “Every mosquito bite carries a risk." Pregnant women or women who could become pregnant should stay away from any place where Zika is spreading, the CDC and World Health Organization says. If they cannot stay away, they should use insect repellent, clothing and other measures to prevent mosquito bites, and condoms to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. Related: Study to Track 10,000 Pregnant Women And pregnant women with any chance of Zika infection need regular scans to see if their baby is affected — and any babies born need an ultrasound or CT scan to check for birth defects. Only 25 percent of the women whose babies were affected got those scans, the CDC said. It’s not clear why not — it could be a health insurance issue — Schuchat said the CDC also believes that all doctors still do not understand the need for such scans. “These findings underscore the serious risk for birth defects posed by Zika virus infection during pregnancy and highlight why pregnant women should avoid Zika virus exposure and that all pregnant women should be screened for possible Zika virus exposure at every prenatal visit,” the CDC team, led by Dr. Margaret Honein, wrote. “Zika is still with us. We don’t know how much transmission there will be this year,” Schuchat said. “Every mosquito bite carries a risk,” she added. “We cannot afford to be complacent when a single bite from a Zika-affected mosquito can lead to such a devastating condition.” Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Why? A sudden surge in Brazilian babies born with microcephaly – a birth defect caused by the Zika infection during pregnancy – sparked massive concern and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a public health emergency. The disease is also linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis.  But there’s an added twist that makes this situation even more complex: Brazil, the country at the center of the current Zika crisis, is slated to host nearly 500,000 visitors this summer. Media attention on the problem has exploded, and experts are even debating whether visitors and athletes should make the trip.  At Casino.org, we’re very familiar with odds – so we decided to calculate the likelihood of the average person contracting Zika this summer in Rio. How does the risk of Zika compare with the risk of other illnesses and accidents? What percentage of the U.S. population currently has the disease? And what are the real odds of catching Zika in Rio this summer? Is the Zika/Rio debate truly a global health crisis – or a case of media hype? Read on to get the full story.    What Do You Have a Greater Chance of Dying From?  So you’ve booked your flight to Rio, and planned your accommodations. What’s the likelihood that you’ll make it back home without catching Zika? Pretty decent: 99.999996 percent.   Another way to gain perspective is to compare your 0.000004 percent chance of contracting Zika in Rio this summer with the odds of dying from various other conditions. Only one person has died in the continental U.S. from Zika as of July 11. You are more than twice as likely to die from legal execution, 73 times more likely to die from choking on food, and over 2,212 times more likely to die in an automobile crash than to even contract Zika in Rio.     How Many Times More Likely Is ...  Should you head to Brazil this summer, you can rest easy when it comes to worrying about Zika: You only have a 1 in 250,000 chance of contracting the virus. By our reckoning, you have a lot more to worry about before you stress about that.   You're thousands of times more likely to die from an auto accident than you are likely to contract Zika in Rio. You’re also hundreds of times more likely to die from a shooting or drowning. Even the most random fatal accidents are more probable: Falling, air accidents, and even lightning strikes should worry you more than contracting Zika.     Zika Infections Across the Country  Zika is making headlines across the United States and around the globe – so we took a look at actual known cases of the virus among people within the United States . First of all, every known case of Zika in the U.S. is associated with travel to an outbreak area or sex with an infected person – there are no known cases of Zika caused by a mosquito bite on American soil as of July 11.  Washington, D.C., tops the list for highest percentage of Zika cases: 0.000893 percent of the population has contracted the disease. New York, Hawaii, and Florida have the next highest rates. In five states – Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, and Alaska – there are no known cases of Zika at all.     Comparing Zika With Ebola, Malaria, and Other Diseases  Zika is constantly being discussed in the media, but how does it compare to other buzzed-about diseases? In the past decade, Ebola, malaria, and the West Nile virus have had just as much media coverage. In 2014, the United States was in an Ebola panic , and many were afraid they would contract Ebola.   While it’s 53 times more likely a resident of the United States will contract Zika over Ebola, those odds were during Ebola’s peak in 2014 and the Zika odds require a trip to Rio this summer. Here in the U.S., your odds of contracting Ebola and Zika are slim, and you are much more likely of contracting a severe form of West Nile disease or even malaria. Your best bet? Wear bug spray and see a doctor if you display any symptoms.    Contracting Zika or Dengue Fever in Rio  As we’ve discovered, the likelihood of contracting Zika this summer isn’t particularly high. It’s much more likely you’d catch a cold or some other common illness from someone beside you in the stands. But what about another mosquito-borne disease?  Dengue fever is a major risk for people who reside in the tropics and subtropics. It is a leading cause of illness and even death in those regions. No vaccine exists, so the best protection is to simply avoid mosquito bites.   Of the nearly half a million projected visitors to Rio this summer, odds are that only two may contract Zika. On the other hand, chances are that about 279 Rio visitors could contract dengue fever.     What Else Is More Likely?  Asteroids. UFOs. Four-leaf clovers. They’re the stuff of dreams – or in some cases, nightmares. But, amazingly, you’re likelier to encounter one of these than you are to become a victim of Zika. For instance, a person is 25 times likelier to find a four-leaf clover on their first try than to contract Zika in Rio this summer.   In addition, a woman in the United States is 8 times more likely to spot a UFO than to give birth to a baby with microcephaly as a result of Zika contracted in Rio.    Calculating the Odds  As you can see, the odds of contracting Zika in Rio this summer are astronomically slim. However, the debate rages on .   Zika is a serious disease, and even one case is a case too many. However, of those who become infected, 8 in 10 don’t even display symptoms, and the remaining 2 in 10 usually aren’t ill enough to require medical treatment. Zika’s greatest danger, by far, is to pregnant women.  It’s always important to do the research, weigh the risks, and calculate the odds.

Lourdes Health System    Administration         Your risk of contracting the Zika virus is very, very low. In fact, many people who contract Zika may not even realize it. So far, there is no mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika virus within the United States, so most screening efforts are looking to see if a person has traveled to an area where it is endemic. Zika is contracted by mosquitoes in Puerto Rico and Central and South America. So, doctors are screening for Zika to see if a person or a sexual partner has been in one of these territories. The tricky part is that the incubation time of the virus is between three and seven days. So, you might come back from a vacation or a conference and show no signs yet.

The Zika virus has been seen in Mexico, Central America, South America, Puerto Rico and on several Caribbean islands. Anyone traveling to these areas may come in contact with the Zika virus. You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites. In the U.S, the Zika virus has so far been found only in limited areas in Florida, although people who have come in contact with the virus elsewhere have returned to country with the infection. (This is called a travel-associated case.)                   Khang N. Tran, MD on behalf of Medical City Plano    Internal Medicine         Only 1 in 5 people bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika will actually get Zika.

For women living in areas where the mosquito-borne virus is spreading, who are trying to make the huge decision of whether, and when, to have a child, there’s not a lot to go on. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women who’ve gotten Zika should wait at least eight weeks to conceive, and that men who’ve gotten it should wait at least six months. But the vast majority of people who are infected with Zika don’t show any symptoms, and children can still be born with birth defects and mothers can still miscarry, even if they never had symptoms. So it’s possible that microcephaly—a birth defect caused by Zika that leads to smaller-than-average head size and other developmental problems—could sneak up on parents who never knew one of them had Zika in the first place. Margaret Chan, the director of the World Health Organization, summed up the harsh reality of the situation in her recent address to the 69th World Health Assembly : “To protect women of childbearing age, all we can offer is advice. Avoid mosquito bites. Delay pregnancy. Do not travel to areas with ongoing transmission.” If a woman is infected in her first trimester, there is between a 1 and 13 percent chance of her fetus developing microcephaly. This is not the most reassuring advice. But a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates how likely it is that the fetus of a woman infected with Zika would develop microcephaly, offering would-be parents at least some idea of the risk they’d be taking on. Analyzing current outbreak data from the Brazilian state of Bahia, researchers from the CDC calculated that if a woman is infected in her first trimester, there is between a 1  and 13 percent chance of her fetus developing microcephaly. Related Stories      Zika Is a Delayed Epidemic   When in Pregnancy Is Zika Most Dangerous?   The Count of American Zika Cases Just Got Bigger   That’s a big range! We have Zika’s stealthy nature to thank for that. The first number is based on the assumption that the Zika infection rate in Bahia’s population is 80 percent and that half the cases of microcephaly reported are false. The second presumes a 10 percent infection rate and that every case reported is true. There’s probably been at least some overreporting of microcephaly in Brazil, and since many people don’t show symptoms and don’t get tested, the actual infection rate is hard to pin down. So we don’t know where in that range the truth lies. A previous analysis of the 2013-2014 Zika outbreak in French Polynesia found about a 1 percent risk—but the microcephaly cases there were found retrospectively, so that might be on the low side. Some important caveats—this study only looked at first-trimester infection, and infection at all stages of pregnancy has been associated with fetal abnormalities and other pregnancy problems. And it also only looked at microcephaly specifically. “Microcephaly is only one possible adverse outcome among a spectrum of conditions that may be part of congenital Zika syndrome,” the researchers write. Still, at least we now have a risk estimate to offer women, along with advice.

Emily Buder   Apr 9, 2018      About the Author      Julie Beck is a senior associate editor at The Atlantic , where she covers health and psychology.   Twitter                 Most Popular  Presented by               Jonathan Ernst / Reuters   Michael Cohen Has a Big Problem    Adam Serwer    It takes strong evidence to execute a search warrant against an attorney representing a subject in a federal investigation, let alone the president’s personal counsel.   Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.   Continue Reading                Alana Semuels / The Atlantic   A House You Can Buy, But Never Own    Alana Semuels      African Americans in the same neighborhoods decimated by subprime lending are now being targeted with new predatory loan offerings, a lawsuit argues.   ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Why the GOP Is Making the Midterm Elections All About Impeachment    David Frum      It may be a counterintuitive gambit, but Republicans are betting it will pay off.   To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

The number of U.S. women infected by the Zika virus is getting crazy high  Here's how to protect yourself.          Mandy Velez     @mandy_velez         May 26, 2016 10:28 AM    #World                                       You may want to grab the bug spray if you plan on taking a trip or going outside this summer. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the Zika virus — a mosquito-born illness that originated in South America — has infected almost 300 pregnant women since it came to the United States, according to the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry, which documents mothers and babies post-Zika diagnosis. This is not-so-great news considering the virus can cause serious birth defects for babies born to infected mothers. But if you aren't pregnant, or don't plan on becoming pregnant for a while, don't panic. Here's some things you should know:               photo:
                                
                                    iStock                     1. The Zika virus is spread through mosquitos or sexual intercourse, so wear bug spray and condoms.   CBS reports that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents, like those with DEET or Picaridin are your best bet. Here are top-rated ones by Consumer Reports. Pro-tip: You want to apply the repellent after you put on sunscreen.       2. Most people don't even know they have the virus.   The virus can spread before symptoms exhibit themselves, so people can have it without even knowing.        3. If you're not pregnant, you'll just get feverish. Then you'll be fine.   Common symptoms include fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis . If you experience any of these after traveling to an infected area, see a doctor. While people have died from complications from the virus, it's rare. Unless you're older, immune-compromised, or go untreated while symptomatic, you will be okay.       4. Still, men who have been in infected areas can pass on the virus in their semen, so make sure he wraps it.   It's unclear whether women can pass on the virus, but men definitely can . Any guy who went to an infected area should use a condom.        5. If you do get infected and you're not trying to get pregnant, it won't affect any future pregnancies.   The virus clears the blood stream in a week's time, so if you have zero plans on bringing life into this world, don't sweat it . There is no evidence to support future pregnancies would be affected.       6. Before vacay, check to see if the virus is in the place you're visiting to be extra careful.   The CDC has a list of places with documented reports of the virus, including many vacay favs, including Mexico, Belize, and Puerto Rico among others . As stated above, wear that bug repellent, and wrap up before sleeping with a sexy stranger.        7. But if you are pregnant, or trying to be, avoid traveling to Zika virus-infected places.   Zika causes a birth defect called Microcephaly in infants, one of many brain abnormalities that can occur in pregnant women post-infection. So avoid these places altogether if you're already pregnant. But if you're traveling to an area while planning to get pregnant, wait at least eight weeks before trying to conceive.       8. There's currently no vaccine for this virus — but you can get a blood test from your doctor if you want.   Just stay away from mosquitos, and tell your pregnant friends the deal. If you suspect you're infected, ask you doctor for a blood test, which they'll send over to the CDC.         #World  #News  #US       Share This Story   SHARE THIS STORY ON FACEBOOK        ···   More      To share this article with others, copy and paste this link:   copy to clipboard     Recommended      We tried Walmart's upgraded clothing lines for all sizes       Too Faced is teasing a rainbow of metallic lipsticks, but fans aren't happy       22 pure AF Captain America quotes       An infuriating new dress code bans hijabs for young girls            This Twitter thread perfectly explains how inaccurate BMI is           Get the latest from Revelist           Related       An airline just passed crazy waistline limits on passengers         Sephora has a real life theme park — but there's a major catch         This artist gives world leaders hipster makeovers                        Most Popular      Sprousehart was caught kissing in Paris, and Twitter is losing its chill       Here's everything in Vlada MUA's rose gold Smashbox collection       This bold workwear line goes up to a size 32       Tear-jerking celebrity reactions to Cardi B's pregnancy       This lookalike may have actually body-snatched Kim Kardashian     Featured Writers       I tried Ashley Nell Tipton's plus-size jewelry line — here's the verdict  Jessica Torres         What happened to Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics?

That's just one way health officials are battling back Zika-carrying mosquitoes in the area.  Joe Raedle/Getty Images     As expected, the Zika outbreak in Florida is growing — though how fast is still difficult to say.  State and federal health officials  say mosquitoes are spreading Zika in two neighborhoods of Miami, including Miami Beach. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told pregnant women Friday not to go into these neighborhoods — and to consider postponing travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County.  Just 37 people have been reported to have  caught the virus in these neighborhoods so far.  But many scientists are concerned that the outbreak in Florida may be larger and more widespread than the number of cases suggests.  "Zika is one of those diseases that is always like an iceberg — you just see the tip," says Alessandro Vespignani , a computer scientist at Northeastern University in Boston, who has been tasked with modeling the spread of the virus.  Most people who get Zika don't even know they have it, Vespignani explains. About 4 in 5 people don't have any symptoms, he says. And those who do get sick often have only mild symptoms that could be confused with the flu. So only about 5 percent of cases get detected, Vespignani has found .     To get better estimates of the number of silent infections in Miami and beyond, Vespignani and his colleagues built computer models that estimate how the virus is likely to spread.  "We estimate there will be 395 infected people by Sept. 15 [in Florida]," says Ira Longini , a biostatistician at the University of Florida, who collaborates with Vespignani.  About 80 of those people will show symptoms, Longini estimates. And about eight pregnant women are likely to get infected during their first trimester — which would put their fetuses at risk for microcephaly.  The number of Zika cases in Florida will very likely continue to rise until October or November, when cooler weather stops the mosquitoes, Longini says, though a number of variables could speed the spread before that.  " For example, on Monday the University of Florida opens its first day of classes," he says. "Tens of thousands of students will be coming from the Miami area, as well as from all over Latin America. So we could see a burst of cases by mid-September here in Gainesville."  Because of these uncertainties, many doctors around the country are recommending that their pregnant patients — and those trying to get pregnant — not travel to southern Florida.  And Florida isn't the only place in the continental U.S. at risk.  Longini has used the computer models to predict where Zika could show up next in the States.
