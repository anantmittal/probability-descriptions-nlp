The NBHQF is aligned with the NQS in that it supports the three broad aims of better care, healthy people/healthy communities, and affordable care. However, it was specifically broadened to include the dissemination of proven interventions and accessible care. The latter concept encompasses affordable care, along with other elements of care accessibility, including the impact of health disparities. > Read More about National Behavioral Health Quality Framework      Behavioral Health Outcomes   Community Early Warning & Monitoring System (C-EMS)  Government Performance & Results Act of 1993 (GPRA)  Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)  Partnership for Patients (PFP)                       Who We Are  Leadership  Regional Administrators  Offices & Centers  Laws & Regulations   Interagency Activities  Advisory Councils  Strategic Initiatives  Budget  SAMHSA's Fiscal Year 2019 Congressional Budget Justification  Contracts   Speeches and presentations  Jobs & Internships  Social Media  Connect with SAMHSA  Social Media Accounts  Resources for Health Professionals  SAMHSA Comment Policy   Contact Us  Directions   About the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use   Elinore McCance-Katz, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use  View Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz’s full biography               Your browser does not support JavaScript!

The NBHQF is aligned with the NQS in that it supports the three broad aims of better care, healthy people/healthy communities, and affordable care. However, it was specifically broadened to include the dissemination of proven interventions and accessible care. The latter concept encompasses affordable care, along with other elements of care accessibility, including the impact of health disparities. > Read More about National Behavioral Health Quality Framework      Behavioral Health Outcomes   Community Early Warning & Monitoring System (C-EMS)  Government Performance & Results Act of 1993 (GPRA)  Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)  Partnership for Patients (PFP)                       Who We Are  Leadership  Regional Administrators  Offices & Centers  Laws & Regulations   Interagency Activities  Advisory Councils  Strategic Initiatives  Budget  SAMHSA's Fiscal Year 2019 Congressional Budget Justification  Contracts   Speeches and presentations  Jobs & Internships  Social Media  Connect with SAMHSA  Social Media Accounts  Resources for Health Professionals  SAMHSA Comment Policy   Contact Us  Directions   About the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use   Elinore McCance-Katz, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use  View Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz’s full biography                                                                              (888) 966-8152  Ready to get help?

Home Xanax Addiction and Abuse Treatment Is Xanax Addictive?         Content Overview      How Addictive is Xanax?  Xanax is a fast-acting benzodiazepine medication. That means it brings about a big change in the brain in a short period of time. As a result, it is considered one of the most addictive benzodiazepine medications on the market today. Risks are higher in people who take the doses of 4 mg/day for longer than 12 weeks, but anyone who abuses the drug could be at risk for addiction.         Table of Contents    How Xanax Affects the Mind  The Body on Drugs  Is It Addiction?  Getting Help   Xanax was first approved for the treatment of panic disorder in the 1970s. Over the years, it has come to be recognized as an effective remedy for anxiety, nausea caused by chemotherapy, depression, and other health issues.  Xanax belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines, and it is a Schedule IV controlled substance, meaning it is considered to have a low potential for abuse. That being said, the evidence speaks for itself, as thousands seek treatment every year for dependencies on this drug. In 2012, 17,019 people were admitted to treatment facilities across the nation citing benzodiazepines like Xanax as their primary or sole drug of abuse, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration states.  These drugs are some of the most highly addictive prescription drugs on the market, and they can hook a user within a matter of mere weeks. Daily use of benzodiazepines for six weeks or more will result in dependency for four in every 10 users, the Royal College of Psychiatrists states.  Addiction is characterized by both psychological and physical dependency. To manage the effects of withdrawal on both the mind and body, it is best to taper off benzodiazepines on a schedule that permits decreasing the dosage by 25 percent for every quarter of the withdrawal period. As with all benzos, withdrawal should only be done via medical detox to ensure the safety of the patient.        The Mind  The Body     How Xanax Affects the Mind  Often, people who are abusing Xanax have anxiety disorders they were trying to treat with the drug. Some 20 percent of Americans suffer from anxiety, Everyday Health reports. Even when used in a medicinal fashion, dependency will generally still occur. The first sign of this is tolerance.

The Body on Drugs  Physical addiction is apparent when a person’s body can no longer function in a healthy way without the substance it’s become accustomed to abusing.  In the case of Xanax, physical addiction is marked by physical withdrawal symptoms that ensue when the substance is discontinued. Some common side effects include headaches, nausea, vomiting, profuse sweating, blurred vision, and convulsions. Physical dependency develops over time as the individual’s body becomes used to the substance. Without it, the person may feel achy all over as the body starts processing the substance out. This discomfort can be treated with mild over-the-counter pain relievers. These side effects, among others, are common occurrences that land many in emergency rooms when they try to detox without professional help. Last year, 44,796 people were treated in American emergency rooms for issues stemming from the use and abuse of benzos like Xanax.  Is It Addiction?

Individuals battling mental illness may be on Xanax to treat symptoms or simply abusing it in attempts to self-medicate, and this abuse can often cause mental health conditions to worsen. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports around half of all people with severe mental illness also have co-occurring substance abuse problems, so this issue is a common one. Dependency is more likely to occur if a person is abusing large amounts of Xanax or using it too frequently. Even prescription users who adhere to a recommended dosing schedule can end up addicted to Xanax though. Poly-drug abusers are far more likely to grow dependent since the other substances they abuse often intensify the effects of benzos like Xanax. For instance, alcohol is commonly abused alongside Xanax and can significantly increase the chance of injury or death, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence states. Study results show a broad range, between 3 percent and 41 percent, of people who struggle with alcoholism also abuse benzodiazepines, per the American Family Physician .

Home Xanax Addiction and Abuse Treatment Is Xanax Addictive?         Content Overview      How Addictive is Xanax?  Xanax is a fast-acting benzodiazepine medication. That means it brings about a big change in the brain in a short period of time. As a result, it is considered one of the most addictive benzodiazepine medications on the market today. Risks are higher in people who take the doses of 4 mg/day for longer than 12 weeks, but anyone who abuses the drug could be at risk for addiction.         Table of Contents    How Xanax Affects the Mind  The Body on Drugs  Is It Addiction?  Getting Help   Xanax was first approved for the treatment of panic disorder in the 1970s. Over the years, it has come to be recognized as an effective remedy for anxiety, nausea caused by chemotherapy, depression, and other health issues.  Xanax belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines, and it is a Schedule IV controlled substance, meaning it is considered to have a low potential for abuse. That being said, the evidence speaks for itself, as thousands seek treatment every year for dependencies on this drug. In 2012, 17,019 people were admitted to treatment facilities across the nation citing benzodiazepines like Xanax as their primary or sole drug of abuse, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration states.  These drugs are some of the most highly addictive prescription drugs on the market, and they can hook a user within a matter of mere weeks. Daily use of benzodiazepines for six weeks or more will result in dependency for four in every 10 users, the Royal College of Psychiatrists states.  Addiction is characterized by both psychological and physical dependency. To manage the effects of withdrawal on both the mind and body, it is best to taper off benzodiazepines on a schedule that permits decreasing the dosage by 25 percent for every quarter of the withdrawal period. As with all benzos, withdrawal should only be done via medical detox to ensure the safety of the patient.        The Mind  The Body     How Xanax Affects the Mind  Often, people who are abusing Xanax have anxiety disorders they were trying to treat with the drug. Some 20 percent of Americans suffer from anxiety, Everyday Health reports. Even when used in a medicinal fashion, dependency will generally still occur. The first sign of this is tolerance. With tolerance, Xanax stops working as well, even as a treatment medication. Those with anxiety will see a return of symptoms and may feel inclined to up their dose in order to keep symptoms at bay. Throughout this process, the brain is becoming more reliant upon the drug to feel normal. When people are mentally addicted to Xanax, they won’t be able to keep their minds off thoughts of the drug. In addition to the health risks associated with detoxing alone, quitting without professional intervention is extremely hard to do since users’ minds are compulsively driving them to use again. The mental impact of withdrawing from Xanax can be turbulent. The mind becomes accustomed to the drug and can go through periods of insomnia, depression, paranoia, and irritability while trying to come off it. The majority of withdrawal symptoms can be treated during medical detox to make the process as comfortable as possible for those in detox.

In fact, psychological dependence is a risk with all benzodiazepines, including Xanax. But who is most at risk of becoming a Xanax addict (people who take Xanax to get high )? And how is physical dependence on Xanax different than drug addiction? We review here. Xanax chemistry and use Xanax tablets contain alprazolam , which is a benzodiazepine and affects the central nervous system . Benzodiazepines were first marketed in the 1960s as anti-anxiety medications and have potent hypnotic and sedative qualities. Today, Xanax has been tested and can produce a beneficial drowsy or calming effect that benefits people who are diagnosed with anxiety or panic disorders. So how is Xanax used clinically? Xanax is prescribed for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety or to manage anxiety disorder. Xanax is also prescribed in the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. This medicine may also be used for other purposes such as short term treatment of insomnia or in adjunctive management of anxiety associated with mental depression. Finally, Xanax may also be used in the treatment of familial, senile, or essential action tremors. Seek full prescription details from a pharmacist or prescribing MD. Xanax and the brain What does Xanax do in the brain and the body? You may be surprised to learn that experts still don’t know how the main ingredient in Xanax (alprazolam) works. What they do know is that Xanax acts as a central nervous system agent. And Xanax works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.  It is presumed that Xanax effects occur as the benzodiazepine binds at specific receptors at several sites within the central nervous system. Clinically, all benzodiazepines cause a dose-related central nervous system depressant activity. Effects vary from mild impairment of task performance to hypnosis. How do you get addicted to Xanax? Xanax addiction occurs after chronic use of Xanax over time. Nonetheless, you may need to take Xanax on a daily basis. Medical conditions that requires frequent use of Xanax can develop into addiction over time. Likewise, if you self-administer Xanax and increase Xanax intake without medical advice, you can get addicted to Xanax.  Or if you are snorting Xanax vs oral , or otherwise taking Xanax other than prescribed, you increase your risk of getting addicted to Xanax. Trusted Helpline Help Available 24/7 1-888-882-1456 PRIVACY GUARANTEED Xanax dependence vs. Xanax addiction The risk of becoming physically dependent on Xanax is high. This is because alprazolam, the active ingredient in Xanax, is habit forming. In fact, you can become physically dependent on Xanax in the first few days if you are using this drug for the first time. This is why Xanax (alprazolam) is recommended for short term or intermittent use.  Furthermore, those who regularly take Xanax will most likely need Xanax withdrawal treatments if and when they abruptly stop using the drug. But drug addiction is different than physical dependence. In fact, doctors expect daily Xanax users to develop physical dependence. The two main indicators of physical dependence on Xanax are tolerance and withdrawal. 1. Tolerance – First, if you use Xanax over a long period of time, the body will develop tolerance, and larger doses will be needed to achieve the initial effects. 2. Withdrawal – In addition, continued use of Xanax can lead to withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped. On the other hand, Xanax addiction occurs when psychological dependence results from Xanax use. In other words, using Xanax to avoid emotional or psychological problems can result in Xanax addiction. What increases Xanax addiction risk? Psychological dependence is a risk with all benzodiazepines, including Xanax. But this risk increases when you consciously take Xanax to get high, or as an emotional or mental coping mechanism for dealing with life. The risk of psychological dependence may also increase at doses greater than 4 mg/day and with longer term use. Xanax addiction risk is further increased in people with a history of alcohol or drug abuse. How to avoid Xanax addiction To avoid Xanax addiction, only take the prescribed amount of Xanax (alprazolam). If you are taking Xanax as prescribed, and notice increasing tolerance to the drug, consult your prescribing physician. Your doctor can assess your particular situation and offer suggestions for other treatment options. Questions about Xanax dependency Always consult your doctor before discontinuing the use of Xanax (alprazolam). Abruptly stopping Xanax may cause withdrawal symptoms and is not recommended.

You’ve conquered one form, you have the power to conquer it again in another form! Lana Claunch 7:20 am                    December 15th, 2011 I’ve been prescribed 1mg Xanax by our Family Physician for 10 years. I just received a letter that he has closed his practice. Boom. The office is closed-phone disconnected. Any ideas about what to do about my Xanax? Addiction Blog 10:09 am                    December 15th, 2011 Hi Lana.  Thanks for your question.  Just to clarify – are you interested in Xanax cessation (stop taking Xanax totally) or are you looking for information about how to find a doctor who can prescribe Xanax to you? Lana Claunch 7:18 pm                    December 15th, 2011 I’m looking for a doctor who will prescribe the Xanax to me. I am an anxious, worrisome person, and the Xanax keeps me at a level…I have NEVER taken it to get high-at night is the only time I “feel” it-it helps me to go to sleep-period. I’m prescribed 4 a day, but I truly have taken 4 maybe twice since he changed the dosage to that last year(I was having a very rough “family problem). jane 11:22 pm                    June 11th, 2013 for probably seven years have been using xanax .25 mg twice a day and then only at night for the last few months.  now i have decreased this to taking .125 before going to bed.   soon i hope to cut it even further.  my question is how long does it take for the drug to totally leave the system?  i am 72 years old and read somewhere that it takes longer for older persons.  wanting to stop it completely and go to using kava but cannot do that as long as the drug is in my system and the combinatoin has been known to bring on coma.  thank you for whatever informatiion you can give. Addiction Blog 12:00 pm                    July 5th, 2013 Hello Jane.  I’d suggest that you speak with a pharmacist about tapering Xanax.  You’ll need medical advice and expertise to help you manage symptoms of withdrawal. Marlo Thomps 4:54 pm                    August 6th, 2013 I have been taking zanax off and on for 2 yera’s now for anxiety and it helps me to sleep… when put on i was given 2 mg. my pharmacist said this was a high dose so to cut in half and i did i have been takind for the last 6 to 7 months 1 mg. before i go to bed… I never need or want or crave more… I did stop taking for a week and my body went through some different feelings of anxiety didn’t feel well and could not sleep went to the e.r. and that doctor told me i was going throuh withdrawls… Should i see my primary doctor and slowly get weened off… I don’t feel like i have to have it but it has treated my anxiety and allowed for a good nigh sleep… I have only taken as prescribed never more actually less than what was prescribed… Do u think I will be ok or do u think i might beaddicted or is my body use to it… I don’t know…. Addiction Blog 7:29 am                    August 13th, 2013 Hello Marlo.  It’s possible that your body is chemically and physically dependent on Xanax.  But this is different than addiction.  Addiction is characterized by craving a drug when you don’t have it. Your decision to stop taking Xanax will be personal.  However, I’m of the opinion that anxiety can be managed using cognitive behavioral techniques as well as psychotherapy.  Not to mention meditation.  That helps alot!  For sleeping and anxiety.  Plus, Xanax is only meant to be used for about 6 weeks, or less. A slow taper off Xanax can AND SHOULD be supervised by your prescribing doctor.  If you’re ready to try some other ways to manage anxiety, schedule an appointment and set up a tapering calendar soon.  Best of luck to you. Donna 1:37 pm                    December 8th, 2013 I am on 1 mg Xanax 3 times a dsy, rarely do I take them that often, usually 1 at night, and 1 during the day if needed. I have gone through withdraw because my son was stealing my pills. It was the worse thing ever. My son moved away but is home now, I just got my script filled, plus had some leftovers so I had over 100 pills. I got up this morning to find 15 left. That means he took at least 90 at one time! what can happen to him. How do I handle this? Addiction Blog 9:23 am                    December 12th, 2013 Hi Donna. I’d suggest that you call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for questions about possible overdose. To intervene with your son, seek the help of a family psychologist.  You’ll need guidance to address a possible suicide attempt or drug abuse. ray 3:16 pm                    May 5th, 2014 I’ve been taking xanax for a month everyday do you think I’m chemically dependent?

What is the medical recommendation for reducing dosage safely? I’ve heard the best way to get off Xanax (if your are taking high doses) is to reduce by .5 mg every three days. Does that sound right? marci 6:34 am                    September 6th, 2015 I am 72 years old my dr put me on  alprazalam one or one and a forth tablet every night.   4 years ago , I know I am addicted. I am tired even tho the drug helps me sleep.  I take one or one and ahalf every nite.  it is o.5 mg. I am frightened for taking it so long. My Dr gave it to me for sleep and said it was not addictive. I am tired and weak most days can you help me?  I had horrible insomnia and nothing over the counter worked nor did the precription sleep aids. I have low thyroid and was told that is what caused the insomnia. I want to get off of it but then i’ll be back to not sleeping.Thank you, Marci Ivana @ Addiction Blog 11:27 am                    September 9th, 2015 Hello Marci. I suggest you read the Ashton manual for quitting benzodiazepines. Slow taper is the way to get off benzodiazepines and any abrupt cut back in doses can trigger adverse withdrawal symptoms (not that they will be completely avoided by tapering). After the months of gradually lowering dosages your recovery will continue for some more time as your brain and body heal from the 4 years of treatment. I suggest you read this article http://prescription-drug.addictionblog.org/what-your-doctors-or-alexander-zaitchik-wont-tell-you-about-benzo-withdrawal/ written by our contributor who went through benzo withdrawal herself to get a better idea of what’s awaiting ahead. Mike 2:13 am                    November 24th, 2015 If I took a half of xanx bar and never took them before. I have a urine test in 10 days.will it be out? Addiction Blog 3:52 pm                    November 24th, 2015 Hi Mike. Well, Xanax is one of the drugs that doesn’t clear very quickly from the body. Depending on the dosage, and the time of use, Xanax can be detected up to six weeks in urine tests. Also, it stays in the blood for several days. Mia 4:55 am                    February 20th, 2017 I have bp issues, primarily at night just before bedtime, and constant pulsatile tinnitus which keeps me up night. Two months ago my doctor prescribed .25 mg of Xanax to take at bedtime to help with the anxiety that these two issues cause. The Xanax helps with the anxiety about the higher nighttime bp, and dulls the pulsatile tinnitus to the point where I can sleep. I do not take it at any other time of the day, nor do I feel the need to. My concern is whether or not this is dangerous and addictive. I hope someone can offer me some advice here. Thanks. Howard 1:18 am                    March 1st, 2017 My xanax use is long-term, or about 4 years.I am addicted and psychologically altered to an unacceptable level.  I reduced dose from 3mg per day to 1mg per day for past 6 mo, and I am sill miserable to be around,aggrivation, impatience, insomnia when lowering dose.Generally miserable: restless, irritable and discontented. Should I stay on the reduced dose or discontinue the 1mg. per day dose? Lydia @ Addiction Blog 11:51 pm                    March 20th, 2017 Hi Howard. I suggest that you speak with your doctor about your concerns. Veronica 7:34 pm                    March 28th, 2017 How long will 1 green xanax stay in my system? Knot 10:58 pm                    March 1st, 2018 I’ve been on 6mg a day for 27 years. I need to know the best way to ween off without cold turkey, I’ve tried cold turkey for 2 months and couldn’t handle it. There must be a better way than cold turkey. Anywhere you can point me to or tell me would be appreciated. How can I find the best method to get off of Xanax without going cold turkey.Thank you. Lydia @ Addiction Blog 11:19 am                    March 2nd, 2018 Hi Knot. I suggest that you look into the Ashton Manual: http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/ It is a manual that can help you with dealing benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal.

Learn What You Can Do   Addiction to Xanax (Alprazolam) Xanax is a powerful benzodiazepine that is often prescribed to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorders and insomnia. It is extremely addictive when used long-term. Xanax is the number one prescribed psychiatric medication in the United States. Seventy percent of teens with a Xanax addiction get the drug from their family’s medicine cabinet. Tolerance to Xanax develops quickly, requiring the user to take more of the drug to achieve the desired effects. Someone with a Xanax addiction may take up to 20 to 30 pills per day. If the user decides to stop taking Xanax, they may experience withdrawal effects, such as tremors, fatigue and impaired coordination. The onset of withdrawal symptoms is a sign that a physical dependence has developed. The development of tolerance and withdrawal are indications of addiction . Once a Xanax addiction has taken hold, daily responsibilities, such as school, work or family, are ignored as energy is redirected towards drug seeking behavior. Questions about treatment?

The symptoms of Xanax withdrawal are similar to those of alcohol or barbiturate withdrawal, and the severity of the symptoms can vary. If convulsions occur, withdrawal from Xanax can be deadly. Normally, the withdrawal process involves slowly reducing the dosage of Xanax and eventually switching the user to a long-acting form of the drug for a period of time. The gradual taper of this drug helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms. Understanding Xanax Xanax is the brand name for alprazolam, a prescription sedative in the benzodiazepines family. Benzodiazepines were originally developed as a replacement for barbiturates. Xanax affects the brain and central nervous system (CNS). It boosts a brain chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which slows down the nerve cell activity in the brain. The result is a calm and relaxed feeling. Because Xanax is a CNS depressant, common effects of the drug include slurred speech, loss of coordination and disorientation. Xanax is dispensed in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg strengths. The pills come in different shapes and colors depending on strength. The 2 mg tablets are white and rectangular in shape. The rest are oval shaped and colored white (0.25 mg), orange (0.5 mg) or blue (1 mg). Xanax is a regulated schedule IV controlled substance. After taking Xanax, the peak effects of the drug are typically felt within one to two hours. As an intermediate-duration drug, Xanax stays in a person’s system for 12 to 15 hours.

However, those who follow a prescription can still become addicted to Xanax. Xanax may be abused in several ways, including: Taking multiple pills Injecting it Snorting it Taking it via blotter paper Taking it with other drugs or alcohol Xanax is typically abused because of the sense of calm and relaxation it causes in the user. Some people abuse Xanax by taking it in higher doses and combining it with other drugs or alcohol in order to achieve the desired high. They say drugs fill a void, or at least that’s what my therapist thinks. The first time I popped a Xanax was the first time I felt relief from my anxiety disorder…There was something oddly comforting about Xanax—the way it came in many shapes and colors, like peach and blue. I enjoyed looking at the pills. They were a pretty little assortment of happiness I could feel just by holding in my hands. Although Xanax put a temporary stop to my agony, it soon introduced a new kind.  - Former benzo addict Ashley Zlatopolsky, Salon.com, 2015 See how Jerry overcame his addiction.  Watch Jerry's Story An overdose on Xanax can be fatal, especially if the drug is taken with alcohol or other drugs . Overdose can also occur if the pills are crushed or chewed, as the drug is designed to be time-released into the system. Xanax overdose symptoms include: Confusion Slowed heart rate Extreme drowsiness Difficulty breathing Fainting Loss of balance Muscle weakness Coma Treatment for a Xanax overdose will depend on how much of the drug was taken and whether other drugs or alcohol were also taken. In the event of an overdose, medical providers may pump the stomach to remove as much of the unabsorbed Xanax as possible. Medications, such as flumazenil, may also be administered as an antidote. Doctors may insert an IV to provide necessary fluids. It is important for anyone suffering from an overdose to be honest with the emergency medical personnel about exactly what substances were taken and how much. Common Xanax Drug Combinations Xanax is commonly used in combination with alcohol or other pills—particularly opiates—to get a better high. Heroin users regularly consume Xanax, as do methadone users. In addition, approximately 40 percent of alcoholics regularly abuse Xanax. Alcohol is particularly dangerous when mixed with Xanax because they are both depressants, which can lead to an overdose and respiratory failure. Get started on the road to recovery.

Signs and Symptoms Effects of Xanax Abuse Xanax Abuse Treatment Teen Xanax Abuse   What Is Xanax?   Even people who take the medication exactly as prescribed can become addicted to it without realizing it.  Xanax is the trade name of the prescription medication alprazolam , and is in a category of drugs known as benzodiazepines . Typically, doctors prescribe Xanax to treat patients suffering from anxiety and panic disorders .  The medication works by interacting with a receptor in the brain that in turn increases inhibitory brain activity, thus tempering any problematic excitement related to anxiety .  As a fast-acting drug, the majority of the benefits are established within an hour after use, with the total duration of effect being at least 6 hours. Xanax is commonly abused by those seeking it for its sedative effects.  Xanax is especially addictive when misused (taken recreationally or other than as directed). Anyone can become addicted to Xanax. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Xanax use can result in tolerance, addiction, and dependence if taken in large quantities or used for a prolonged period.  Even people who take the medication exactly as prescribed can become addicted to it without realizing it.       1-888-744-0069   Treatment Advisors Are On Call 24/7   Who Answers?    Thinking About Getting Rehab?         Signs and Symptoms    Other Names for Xanax   Alprazolam – The chemical name for the drug.  Niravam – A variation of alprazolam that dissolves on the tongue rather than needing to be swallowed with water.   Street names include:   Xannies/Zannies.  Handlebars/Bars.  Blue footballs.  Benzos.   Symptoms and signs of Xanax abuse can be both physical and mental. Physical Signs and Symptoms Physical symptoms may include:  Feelings of elation.  Drowsiness.  Sleeping for extended periods of time.  Light-headedness.  Difficulty concentrating.  Problems with memory.  Sluggishness.  Nausea.  Headache.  Mental and Social Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of Xanax abuse typically can infiltrate nearly all aspects of a person's life. It is common for people with Xanax problems to have strained relationships with close friends and family, as well as marital problems. Professional issues are also common, as those struggling with a Xanax dependence will often miss work due to them not feeling well, especially if they are unable to take Xanax and experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Other common signs of a Xanax addiction include financial problems . Finances can suffer due to spending increased amounts of money on the substance, or dedicating time to obtaining more drug that would otherwise be spent more productively. Additionally, someone that is overusing Xanax will appear excessively tired and lethargic while lacking the motivation to engage in normal activities of daily life. They will show signs of lower interest in tasks that require sustained attention . Benzodiazepine drugs can have an amnestic effect, making it quite easy for individuals abusing them to forget the fine details of important conversations or tasks that need to be performed. You might find yourself thinking about how you are going to get more Xanax when you have finished what you have. You could develop cognitive problems that make it difficult for you to articulate your words. Addicts also tend to build up a tolerance to Xanax. This means that more of the substance is required to achieve a similar effect to when it was first used. In addition, those people dependent on the drug will experience withdrawal symptoms when they are not taking the medication. An addict's life begins to revolve around drug use, and it is common for users to start taking other drugs when they do not have access to Xanax. Effects of Xanax Abuse Using Xanax, especially for a prolonged period, can have numerous negative effects on your body. The medication is a central nervous system depressant, which means that it slows down aspects of your mental and physical health. The most common effects of Xanax use include:  Lack of coordination.  Slurred speech.  Confusion.  Disorientation.  Xanax is known to slow down respiratory rates of people that abuse the substance. Alone, this can be dangerous as your breathing slows, but the situation becomes more troubling when the substance is mixed with alcohol . Since they are both depressants, their combined effect could lead to serious injury, coma, or death . Some people develop memory impairment , which typically only affects the short-term memory. Sedation is also a concern for Xanax users. People who take the medication in large doses might experience severe sedation that can last for 3-4 days.  Xanax addiction is a widespread problem and affects the lives of numerous adults. Because the addiction develops over time, it may take some time before you even realize that you have a problem.  According to the 2011 Treatment Episode Data Set Report, 60,200 people obtaining drug abuse treatment were addicted to benzodiazepines .  This showed a drastic increase from the 22,400 people who sought treatment for benzodiazepine addictions in 1998.  Xanax Abuse Treatment People dealing with tolerance, addiction, and dependence to Xanax must always seek professional treatment to safely end use of the drug. Sudden unsupervised cessation of Xanax use is related to many unpleasant, if not dangerous withdrawal effects—including seizures . Depending on the level of your dependence, the duration of the addiction, and your general physical health, an inpatient treatment program may be the most appropriate option.  Inpatient treatment programs give you a stable and temptation-free environment for your recovery. Centers have around-the-clock care. The medical staff will help you cope with your withdrawal symptoms and may administer medication to make the [//www.drugabuse.com/library/sedative-abuse-detox/] detoxification symptoms [/link] subside until the drug is completely cleared from your system.  It's not too late to get help. Treatment is available.  Rather than ending the medication suddenly, a medical professional may wean you from the drug by reducing the dose on a regular basis until you no longer take Xanax. A typical day in an inpatient facility could include:  Addiction education.  Individual and group therapy sessions.  Relapse prevention techniques / skills training.   Outpatient treatment programs allow people to reside at their homes for the duration of recovery treatment. There are few typical variants on the type of outpatient programs that are offered. A daily check-in program requires you to check in with a drug abuse counselor every day, while the more intensive outpatient, day treatment and partial hospitalization programs can require you to be at the center for a set number of hours each day. Similar therapeutic interventions will be employed in both outpatient and residential treatment programs, including ongoing behavioral therapy sessions and possibly educational lectures about addiction and recovery. Many treatment options exist outside of the professional setting with community-based treatment and 12-step meetings being successful ways to end your relationship with the substance. Teen Xanax Abuse Xanax abuse is not only a problem among adults; teenagers have prescription medication addictions as well. According to the 2014 Monitoring the Future survey, 13.9% of teenagers report using prescription drugs for non-medical purposes in the past year. While this includes other prescription drugs, Xanax seems to be a quite popular prescription drug abused by teens. Xanax is also monitored in the tranquilizer category by the same survey. These data illustrate that tranquilizer use is showing some mild declines in the years between 2011 and 2014 across 8 th , 10 th , and 12 th graders sampled.

How to Tell If You or a Loved One Is Addicted Paying for Treatment Getting Treatment and Starting Recovery Short- and Long-Term Side Effects of Xanax Dependency Find a Treatment Program for Xanax Addiction    html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"     Are You Addicted to Xanax?  Xanax (alprazolam) is a central nervous system depressant prescribed for the treatment of anxiety, including generalized and social anxiety disorders as well as panic disorder.    Is Xanax Addictive?  When taken in short-term therapeutic doses under the care of a physician,Xanax has a low risk of addiction or dependence.  However, using the drug long-term, taking high doses and mixing the drug with other depressants can hasten the onset of psychological and physical dependence and increases the risk of experiencing serious and sometimes life-threatening withdrawal symptoms. 1  Xanax has a high potential for abuse due to its pleasurable, sedating effects on the central nervous system. Even people who use Xanax for a short time and take it as prescribed may be at risk of dependence. People who are prescribed doses greater than 4mg per day and for longer than 12 weeks may be at greater risk of dependence. 1  Some people who abuse Xanax may take several pills at once or crush the pills into a powder and snort them to speed the onset of effects. Both of these methods of abuse increase the risk of dependency and addiction.  Withdrawal Symptoms  Repeated, heavy and long-term use causes significant changes in the brain and body. When people develop physical dependence, they may experience a number of withdrawal symptoms when they try to quit or cut back on Xanax use. Because of the severity of the withdrawal symptoms, Xanax can be difficult to quit. 1  Some of the withdrawal symptoms associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal can be dangerous. People who have been abusing Xanax heavily for a long period of time should seek medical supervision for detox and withdrawal.  Common withdrawal symptoms include: 1       Dysphoria, ranging from mild to severe.  Loss or decrease of appetite.  Heightened sensory perception.  Pins and needles sensation on skin.  Sweating.  Muscle cramps.  Vomiting.  Stomach cramps.  Diarrhea.      Blurred vision.  Impaired concentration.  Depression.  Suicidal thoughts.  Rebound anxiety symptoms.  Agitation.  Muscle twitching.  Tremors.  Seizures.         How to Tell If You or a Loved One Is Addicted   Some people may not recognize they have a problem because they were prescribed the drug.  Xanax addiction can be challenging for people who abuse the drug. Their use can affect their loved ones as well. Some people may not recognize they have a problem because a physician prescribed them the drug.  If you or someone you love is using Xanax, it is important to be mindful of the signs and symptoms of addiction so you can recognize them and seek treatment if possible.  Common symptoms of Xanax addiction are: 1,3       Inability to discuss use without becoming defensive.  Needing more of the drug to achieve the same effect.  Using the drug in a way other than prescribed (i.e., snorting, injecting, mixing with other drugs, etc.).  Making excuses to use the drug.  Needing the drug to function.      Neglecting to eat.  Inability to stop or control use even if desired.  Failure to maintain personal and professional commitments and responsibilities.  Missing important activities due to drug use.  Secretive behavior.  Continuing to use despite any harm it may cause.     If you or someone you love exhibits any of the above symptoms of Xanax addiction, it is crucial to seek treatment as soon as possible. Do not attempt to quit alone since some withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, can be life-threatening. It is important to detox under the supervision of a medical professional who can safely manage the effects of withdrawal while the drug is slowly tapered off.

You are typically charged on a per diem basis.     Whether you are treated at an inpatient or an outpatient facility : Inpatient treatment is frequently more expensive than outpatient and may not be fully covered by insurance.     Where you stay: Both the location of the facility and the facility itself can affect your out-of-pocket cost. Cost of treatment varies from state to state and your insurance coverage may vary for in- and out-of-network providers. Some treatment programs are more expensive than others because they offer private rooms, luxury amenities and other specialty services. Do some research to determine which facility is best suited for your needs and your budget.     Unfortunately, the cost of a Xanax rehab program can be a barrier for many people who need help. Options for financing treatment include:      Health insurance: Some rehabs accept insurance as a form of payment. Many insurance plans do not cover 100% of treatment costs, so you may still have out-of-pocket costs. The Affordable Care Act requires that Medicaid plans and those offered on the health insurance marketplace offer coverage for substance abuse disorders. If you are not insured, go to your state insurance website to see if you are eligible for any plans.     Personal savings : Using some of your savings to pay for treatment can be a good investment. Getting help for addiction can improve the quality of your life and can help you earn and save more money in the long run due to the costs of addiction.     Payment plans and sliding scale rates : Many treatment facilities offer payment plans either in-house or through a third-party lender. Contact the facility you are interested in to see if they have installment plans available for funding treatment. Some treatment facilities offer sliding scale rates for those struggling to afford treatment.     Loans: Consider taking out a bank loan to help you cover the cost of treatment. Find the lowest interest rate possible and make sure that you can afford the monthly payments.     Credit cards: Credit cards are another method of paying for treatment. Again, make sure the interest rates and minimum payments are within your budget.     Borrowing : Ask a family member or a friend for a personal loan to help you cover the costs of treatment.     Crowdfunding . Crowdfunding sites (i.e., GoFundMe ) let you request donations from family, friends and others. You may be surprised at how many people will help support your recovery.     Sell assets : You may want to consider selling valuable assets such as vehicles, boats or jewelry to help fund the cost of treatment. You can always purchase more items following treatment.     Churches and nonprofit organizations : Many churches and charities offer free or low-cost treatment services for drug addiction.     If you are uninsured and concerned about financing your addiction treatment, you can call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) 24/7 national helpline for assistance and information at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).    Getting Treatment and Starting Recovery  When you're ready to get help for Xanax addiction, you'll want to consider the many different treatment options available. Each person is unique and may have developed an addiction to Xanax for different reasons. Finding the right program that meets your needs and budget is crucial.  Typical treatment options for Xanax addiction include: 2,5     Inpatient treatment:Inpatient treatment occurs in a 24-hour residential facility. Treatment programs are highly structured and designed to provide maximum support for recovery. Treatment ranges from 30 to 90 days and may be longer in severe cases. Inpatient treatment for Xanax addiction usually includes some combination of medically supervised detox, counseling, therapy, 12-step or other support groups, relapse prevention and aftercare planning.    Outpatient treatment  12-step programs: support and structure through a step-by-step process toward recovery  Teen treatment: unique issues teenagers with addiction face.  Dual diagnosis treatment:   Cognitive behavioral therapy:  2 Other things you'll want to consider when choosing an addiction treatment center are:     Program philosophy: Look for a treatment center whose philosophy and values are in alignment with your own. If you don't believe in the center's approach to addiction and treatment, it could hinder your chance of recovery. For example, if you are a Christian, a bible-based treatment center may be best suited for you. On the other hand, if you don't hold any religious beliefs, you would likely be better suited for a secular treatment center instead of a faith-based one.     Program accreditation: Research and learn about the accreditation of the treatment facility you want to attend. Accreditation holds facilities accountable to certain standards and state licensing requirements that help ensure you receive quality care.     Qualifications of staff: Choose a facility with a highly qualified staff that includes psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, counselors, recovery coaches and other professionals you may need, such as spiritual leaders, massage therapists and acupuncturists.     Location: Consider the location of the facility as well. Do you want to be close to home so that friends and family can visit or would you benefit from a facility far from home? You will also want to consider whether your insurance covers treatment in that state as well.     Short- and Long-Term Side Effects of Xanax Dependency Common side effects of Xanax abuse are due to the drug's effect on gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that slows activity throughout the brain. Xanax increases the activity of GABA, which slows nerve impulses. 9 Short-term side effects of Xanax abuse include: 1      Drowsiness.  Dizziness.  Slurred speech.  Poor coordination.  Irritability.  Nausea and vomiting.  Upset stomach.  Dry mouth or increased saliva.  Confusion.  Memory problems.      Difficulty concentrating.  Loss of libido.  Blurred and double vision.  Tremors.  Unsteady gait.  Slowed reaction time.  Heart palpitations.  Low blood pressure.  Fainting.     More serious potential long-term effects of Xanax abuse that may occur include: 6,7,8,9    Depression.    Physical dependence, tolerance and withdrawal.    Cognitive impairments.    Aggressive behavior.    Slurred speech.     Find a Treatment Program for Xanax Addiction If you or a loved one is struggling with Xanax addiction, don't hesitate to reach out for help.

The NBHQF is aligned with the NQS in that it supports the three broad aims of better care, healthy people/healthy communities, and affordable care. However, it was specifically broadened to include the dissemination of proven interventions and accessible care. The latter concept encompasses affordable care, along with other elements of care accessibility, including the impact of health disparities. > Read More about National Behavioral Health Quality Framework      Behavioral Health Outcomes   Community Early Warning & Monitoring System (C-EMS)  Government Performance & Results Act of 1993 (GPRA)  Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)  Partnership for Patients (PFP)                       Who We Are  Leadership  Regional Administrators  Offices & Centers  Laws & Regulations   Interagency Activities  Advisory Councils  Strategic Initiatives  Budget  SAMHSA's Fiscal Year 2019 Congressional Budget Justification  Contracts   Speeches and presentations  Jobs & Internships  Social Media  Connect with SAMHSA  Social Media Accounts  Resources for Health Professionals  SAMHSA Comment Policy   Contact Us  Directions   About the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use   Elinore McCance-Katz, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use  View Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz’s full biography               Your browser does not support JavaScript!

Home Xanax Addiction and Abuse Treatment Is Xanax Addictive?         Content Overview      How Addictive is Xanax?  Xanax is a fast-acting benzodiazepine medication. That means it brings about a big change in the brain in a short period of time. As a result, it is considered one of the most addictive benzodiazepine medications on the market today. Risks are higher in people who take the doses of 4 mg/day for longer than 12 weeks, but anyone who abuses the drug could be at risk for addiction.         Table of Contents    How Xanax Affects the Mind  The Body on Drugs  Is It Addiction?  Getting Help   Xanax was first approved for the treatment of panic disorder in the 1970s. Over the years, it has come to be recognized as an effective remedy for anxiety, nausea caused by chemotherapy, depression, and other health issues.  Xanax belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines, and it is a Schedule IV controlled substance, meaning it is considered to have a low potential for abuse. That being said, the evidence speaks for itself, as thousands seek treatment every year for dependencies on this drug. In 2012, 17,019 people were admitted to treatment facilities across the nation citing benzodiazepines like Xanax as their primary or sole drug of abuse, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration states.  These drugs are some of the most highly addictive prescription drugs on the market, and they can hook a user within a matter of mere weeks. Daily use of benzodiazepines for six weeks or more will result in dependency for four in every 10 users, the Royal College of Psychiatrists states.  Addiction is characterized by both psychological and physical dependency. To manage the effects of withdrawal on both the mind and body, it is best to taper off benzodiazepines on a schedule that permits decreasing the dosage by 25 percent for every quarter of the withdrawal period. As with all benzos, withdrawal should only be done via medical detox to ensure the safety of the patient.        The Mind  The Body     How Xanax Affects the Mind  Often, people who are abusing Xanax have anxiety disorders they were trying to treat with the drug. Some 20 percent of Americans suffer from anxiety, Everyday Health reports. Even when used in a medicinal fashion, dependency will generally still occur. The first sign of this is tolerance. With tolerance, Xanax stops working as well, even as a treatment medication. Those with anxiety will see a return of symptoms and may feel inclined to up their dose in order to keep symptoms at bay. Throughout this process, the brain is becoming more reliant upon the drug to feel normal. When people are mentally addicted to Xanax, they won’t be able to keep their minds off thoughts of the drug. In addition to the health risks associated with detoxing alone, quitting without professional intervention is extremely hard to do since users’ minds are compulsively driving them to use again. The mental impact of withdrawing from Xanax can be turbulent. The mind becomes accustomed to the drug and can go through periods of insomnia, depression, paranoia, and irritability while trying to come off it. The majority of withdrawal symptoms can be treated during medical detox to make the process as comfortable as possible for those in detox. As many as 44 percent of chronic benzodiazepine users ultimately become dependent on their drug of choice, the Journal of Addictive Behaviors notes. Addiction is often due to psychological factors that influence individuals to keep using.   The Body on Drugs  Physical addiction is apparent when a person’s body can no longer function in a healthy way without the substance it’s become accustomed to abusing.  In the case of Xanax, physical addiction is marked by physical withdrawal symptoms that ensue when the substance is discontinued. Some common side effects include headaches, nausea, vomiting, profuse sweating, blurred vision, and convulsions. Physical dependency develops over time as the individual’s body becomes used to the substance. Without it, the person may feel achy all over as the body starts processing the substance out. This discomfort can be treated with mild over-the-counter pain relievers. These side effects, among others, are common occurrences that land many in emergency rooms when they try to detox without professional help. Last year, 44,796 people were treated in American emergency rooms for issues stemming from the use and abuse of benzos like Xanax.  Is It Addiction? Regardless of what substance has been abused, the red flags that signal addiction are the same across the board. They include:  Using every time withdrawal symptoms start to appear  Tolerance that causes the user to increase the dose  Avoiding family functions or hanging out with friends because it takes away from time using the drug  Worrying about one’s Xanax supply and thinking about the next time it can be used  Continued use despite great conflict due to Xanax use  Inability to control how much or how often the drug is used  No one is exempt from drug dependence, but there are certain demographics that are more prone to it. It is thought females account for more benzo addictions than males, but this may merely be due to women being more likely to receive a prescription for the drugs. Erowid notes two times as many women are using these drugs as men. Age plays a significant factor in prescribing trends, too. A 2008 report by the National Institutes of Health points out only 2.6 percent of people aged 18-35 used benzodiazepines, versus 8.7 percent among those aged 65-80. It is unclear whether these prescriptions are truly more likely to be given to an older individual or if older people simply have more access to healthcare and are more inclined to seek treatment. Individuals battling mental illness may be on Xanax to treat symptoms or simply abusing it in attempts to self-medicate, and this abuse can often cause mental health conditions to worsen. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports around half of all people with severe mental illness also have co-occurring substance abuse problems, so this issue is a common one. Dependency is more likely to occur if a person is abusing large amounts of Xanax or using it too frequently. Even prescription users who adhere to a recommended dosing schedule can end up addicted to Xanax though. Poly-drug abusers are far more likely to grow dependent since the other substances they abuse often intensify the effects of benzos like Xanax. For instance, alcohol is commonly abused alongside Xanax and can significantly increase the chance of injury or death, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence states.

Home Xanax Addiction and Abuse Treatment Is Xanax Addictive?         Content Overview      How Addictive is Xanax?  Xanax is a fast-acting benzodiazepine medication. That means it brings about a big change in the brain in a short period of time. As a result, it is considered one of the most addictive benzodiazepine medications on the market today. Risks are higher in people who take the doses of 4 mg/day for longer than 12 weeks, but anyone who abuses the drug could be at risk for addiction.         Table of Contents    How Xanax Affects the Mind  The Body on Drugs  Is It Addiction?  Getting Help   Xanax was first approved for the treatment of panic disorder in the 1970s. Over the years, it has come to be recognized as an effective remedy for anxiety, nausea caused by chemotherapy, depression, and other health issues.  Xanax belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines, and it is a Schedule IV controlled substance, meaning it is considered to have a low potential for abuse. That being said, the evidence speaks for itself, as thousands seek treatment every year for dependencies on this drug. In 2012, 17,019 people were admitted to treatment facilities across the nation citing benzodiazepines like Xanax as their primary or sole drug of abuse, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration states.  These drugs are some of the most highly addictive prescription drugs on the market, and they can hook a user within a matter of mere weeks. Daily use of benzodiazepines for six weeks or more will result in dependency for four in every 10 users, the Royal College of Psychiatrists states.  Addiction is characterized by both psychological and physical dependency. To manage the effects of withdrawal on both the mind and body, it is best to taper off benzodiazepines on a schedule that permits decreasing the dosage by 25 percent for every quarter of the withdrawal period. As with all benzos, withdrawal should only be done via medical detox to ensure the safety of the patient.        The Mind  The Body     How Xanax Affects the Mind  Often, people who are abusing Xanax have anxiety disorders they were trying to treat with the drug. Some 20 percent of Americans suffer from anxiety, Everyday Health reports. Even when used in a medicinal fashion, dependency will generally still occur. The first sign of this is tolerance. With tolerance, Xanax stops working as well, even as a treatment medication. Those with anxiety will see a return of symptoms and may feel inclined to up their dose in order to keep symptoms at bay. Throughout this process, the brain is becoming more reliant upon the drug to feel normal. When people are mentally addicted to Xanax, they won’t be able to keep their minds off thoughts of the drug. In addition to the health risks associated with detoxing alone, quitting without professional intervention is extremely hard to do since users’ minds are compulsively driving them to use again. The mental impact of withdrawing from Xanax can be turbulent. The mind becomes accustomed to the drug and can go through periods of insomnia, depression, paranoia, and irritability while trying to come off it. The majority of withdrawal symptoms can be treated during medical detox to make the process as comfortable as possible for those in detox. As many as 44 percent of chronic benzodiazepine users ultimately become dependent on their drug of choice, the Journal of Addictive Behaviors notes. Addiction is often due to psychological factors that influence individuals to keep using.   The Body on Drugs  Physical addiction is apparent when a person’s body can no longer function in a healthy way without the substance it’s become accustomed to abusing.  In the case of Xanax, physical addiction is marked by physical withdrawal symptoms that ensue when the substance is discontinued. Some common side effects include headaches, nausea, vomiting, profuse sweating, blurred vision, and convulsions. Physical dependency develops over time as the individual’s body becomes used to the substance. Without it, the person may feel achy all over as the body starts processing the substance out. This discomfort can be treated with mild over-the-counter pain relievers. These side effects, among others, are common occurrences that land many in emergency rooms when they try to detox without professional help. Last year, 44,796 people were treated in American emergency rooms for issues stemming from the use and abuse of benzos like Xanax.  Is It Addiction? Regardless of what substance has been abused, the red flags that signal addiction are the same across the board. They include:  Using every time withdrawal symptoms start to appear  Tolerance that causes the user to increase the dose  Avoiding family functions or hanging out with friends because it takes away from time using the drug  Worrying about one’s Xanax supply and thinking about the next time it can be used  Continued use despite great conflict due to Xanax use  Inability to control how much or how often the drug is used  No one is exempt from drug dependence, but there are certain demographics that are more prone to it. It is thought females account for more benzo addictions than males, but this may merely be due to women being more likely to receive a prescription for the drugs. Erowid notes two times as many women are using these drugs as men. Age plays a significant factor in prescribing trends, too. A 2008 report by the National Institutes of Health points out only 2.6 percent of people aged 18-35 used benzodiazepines, versus 8.7 percent among those aged 65-80. It is unclear whether these prescriptions are truly more likely to be given to an older individual or if older people simply have more access to healthcare and are more inclined to seek treatment. Individuals battling mental illness may be on Xanax to treat symptoms or simply abusing it in attempts to self-medicate, and this abuse can often cause mental health conditions to worsen. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports around half of all people with severe mental illness also have co-occurring substance abuse problems, so this issue is a common one. Dependency is more likely to occur if a person is abusing large amounts of Xanax or using it too frequently. Even prescription users who adhere to a recommended dosing schedule can end up addicted to Xanax though. Poly-drug abusers are far more likely to grow dependent since the other substances they abuse often intensify the effects of benzos like Xanax. For instance, alcohol is commonly abused alongside Xanax and can significantly increase the chance of injury or death, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence states. Study results show a broad range, between 3 percent and 41 percent, of people who struggle with alcoholism also abuse benzodiazepines, per the American Family Physician .   Getting Help  Therapeutic techniques, such as music and arts therapy, and wellness-focused support groups, are beneficial in combatting the psychological impact of an addiction to Xanax. In addition, the physical part of addiction requires medical detox. With this combined form of treatment, users can take charge of their lives again.

In fact, psychological dependence is a risk with all benzodiazepines, including Xanax. But who is most at risk of becoming a Xanax addict (people who take Xanax to get high )? And how is physical dependence on Xanax different than drug addiction? We review here. Xanax chemistry and use Xanax tablets contain alprazolam , which is a benzodiazepine and affects the central nervous system . Benzodiazepines were first marketed in the 1960s as anti-anxiety medications and have potent hypnotic and sedative qualities. Today, Xanax has been tested and can produce a beneficial drowsy or calming effect that benefits people who are diagnosed with anxiety or panic disorders. So how is Xanax used clinically? Xanax is prescribed for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety or to manage anxiety disorder. Xanax is also prescribed in the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. This medicine may also be used for other purposes such as short term treatment of insomnia or in adjunctive management of anxiety associated with mental depression. Finally, Xanax may also be used in the treatment of familial, senile, or essential action tremors. Seek full prescription details from a pharmacist or prescribing MD. Xanax and the brain What does Xanax do in the brain and the body? You may be surprised to learn that experts still don’t know how the main ingredient in Xanax (alprazolam) works. What they do know is that Xanax acts as a central nervous system agent. And Xanax works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.  It is presumed that Xanax effects occur as the benzodiazepine binds at specific receptors at several sites within the central nervous system. Clinically, all benzodiazepines cause a dose-related central nervous system depressant activity. Effects vary from mild impairment of task performance to hypnosis. How do you get addicted to Xanax? Xanax addiction occurs after chronic use of Xanax over time. Nonetheless, you may need to take Xanax on a daily basis. Medical conditions that requires frequent use of Xanax can develop into addiction over time. Likewise, if you self-administer Xanax and increase Xanax intake without medical advice, you can get addicted to Xanax.  Or if you are snorting Xanax vs oral , or otherwise taking Xanax other than prescribed, you increase your risk of getting addicted to Xanax. Trusted Helpline Help Available 24/7 1-888-882-1456 PRIVACY GUARANTEED Xanax dependence vs. Xanax addiction The risk of becoming physically dependent on Xanax is high. This is because alprazolam, the active ingredient in Xanax, is habit forming. In fact, you can become physically dependent on Xanax in the first few days if you are using this drug for the first time. This is why Xanax (alprazolam) is recommended for short term or intermittent use.  Furthermore, those who regularly take Xanax will most likely need Xanax withdrawal treatments if and when they abruptly stop using the drug. But drug addiction is different than physical dependence. In fact, doctors expect daily Xanax users to develop physical dependence. The two main indicators of physical dependence on Xanax are tolerance and withdrawal. 1. Tolerance – First, if you use Xanax over a long period of time, the body will develop tolerance, and larger doses will be needed to achieve the initial effects. 2. Withdrawal – In addition, continued use of Xanax can lead to withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped. On the other hand, Xanax addiction occurs when psychological dependence results from Xanax use. In other words, using Xanax to avoid emotional or psychological problems can result in Xanax addiction. What increases Xanax addiction risk? Psychological dependence is a risk with all benzodiazepines, including Xanax. But this risk increases when you consciously take Xanax to get high, or as an emotional or mental coping mechanism for dealing with life. The risk of psychological dependence may also increase at doses greater than 4 mg/day and with longer term use. Xanax addiction risk is further increased in people with a history of alcohol or drug abuse. How to avoid Xanax addiction To avoid Xanax addiction, only take the prescribed amount of Xanax (alprazolam). If you are taking Xanax as prescribed, and notice increasing tolerance to the drug, consult your prescribing physician. Your doctor can assess your particular situation and offer suggestions for other treatment options. Questions about Xanax dependency Always consult your doctor before discontinuing the use of Xanax (alprazolam). Abruptly stopping Xanax may cause withdrawal symptoms and is not recommended.

You’ve conquered one form, you have the power to conquer it again in another form! Lana Claunch 7:20 am                    December 15th, 2011 I’ve been prescribed 1mg Xanax by our Family Physician for 10 years. I just received a letter that he has closed his practice. Boom. The office is closed-phone disconnected. Any ideas about what to do about my Xanax? Addiction Blog 10:09 am                    December 15th, 2011 Hi Lana.  Thanks for your question.  Just to clarify – are you interested in Xanax cessation (stop taking Xanax totally) or are you looking for information about how to find a doctor who can prescribe Xanax to you? Lana Claunch 7:18 pm                    December 15th, 2011 I’m looking for a doctor who will prescribe the Xanax to me. I am an anxious, worrisome person, and the Xanax keeps me at a level…I have NEVER taken it to get high-at night is the only time I “feel” it-it helps me to go to sleep-period. I’m prescribed 4 a day, but I truly have taken 4 maybe twice since he changed the dosage to that last year(I was having a very rough “family problem). jane 11:22 pm                    June 11th, 2013 for probably seven years have been using xanax .25 mg twice a day and then only at night for the last few months.  now i have decreased this to taking .125 before going to bed.   soon i hope to cut it even further.  my question is how long does it take for the drug to totally leave the system?  i am 72 years old and read somewhere that it takes longer for older persons.  wanting to stop it completely and go to using kava but cannot do that as long as the drug is in my system and the combinatoin has been known to bring on coma.  thank you for whatever informatiion you can give. Addiction Blog 12:00 pm                    July 5th, 2013 Hello Jane.  I’d suggest that you speak with a pharmacist about tapering Xanax.  You’ll need medical advice and expertise to help you manage symptoms of withdrawal. Marlo Thomps 4:54 pm                    August 6th, 2013 I have been taking zanax off and on for 2 yera’s now for anxiety and it helps me to sleep… when put on i was given 2 mg. my pharmacist said this was a high dose so to cut in half and i did i have been takind for the last 6 to 7 months 1 mg. before i go to bed… I never need or want or crave more… I did stop taking for a week and my body went through some different feelings of anxiety didn’t feel well and could not sleep went to the e.r. and that doctor told me i was going throuh withdrawls… Should i see my primary doctor and slowly get weened off… I don’t feel like i have to have it but it has treated my anxiety and allowed for a good nigh sleep… I have only taken as prescribed never more actually less than what was prescribed… Do u think I will be ok or do u think i might beaddicted or is my body use to it… I don’t know…. Addiction Blog 7:29 am                    August 13th, 2013 Hello Marlo.  It’s possible that your body is chemically and physically dependent on Xanax.  But this is different than addiction.  Addiction is characterized by craving a drug when you don’t have it. Your decision to stop taking Xanax will be personal.  However, I’m of the opinion that anxiety can be managed using cognitive behavioral techniques as well as psychotherapy.  Not to mention meditation.  That helps alot!  For sleeping and anxiety.  Plus, Xanax is only meant to be used for about 6 weeks, or less. A slow taper off Xanax can AND SHOULD be supervised by your prescribing doctor.  If you’re ready to try some other ways to manage anxiety, schedule an appointment and set up a tapering calendar soon.  Best of luck to you. Donna 1:37 pm                    December 8th, 2013 I am on 1 mg Xanax 3 times a dsy, rarely do I take them that often, usually 1 at night, and 1 during the day if needed. I have gone through withdraw because my son was stealing my pills. It was the worse thing ever. My son moved away but is home now, I just got my script filled, plus had some leftovers so I had over 100 pills. I got up this morning to find 15 left. That means he took at least 90 at one time! what can happen to him. How do I handle this? Addiction Blog 9:23 am                    December 12th, 2013 Hi Donna. I’d suggest that you call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for questions about possible overdose. To intervene with your son, seek the help of a family psychologist.  You’ll need guidance to address a possible suicide attempt or drug abuse. ray 3:16 pm                    May 5th, 2014 I’ve been taking xanax for a month everyday do you think I’m chemically dependent?

What is the medical recommendation for reducing dosage safely? I’ve heard the best way to get off Xanax (if your are taking high doses) is to reduce by .5 mg every three days. Does that sound right? marci 6:34 am                    September 6th, 2015 I am 72 years old my dr put me on  alprazalam one or one and a forth tablet every night.   4 years ago , I know I am addicted. I am tired even tho the drug helps me sleep.  I take one or one and ahalf every nite.  it is o.5 mg. I am frightened for taking it so long. My Dr gave it to me for sleep and said it was not addictive. I am tired and weak most days can you help me?  I had horrible insomnia and nothing over the counter worked nor did the precription sleep aids. I have low thyroid and was told that is what caused the insomnia. I want to get off of it but then i’ll be back to not sleeping.Thank you, Marci Ivana @ Addiction Blog 11:27 am                    September 9th, 2015 Hello Marci. I suggest you read the Ashton manual for quitting benzodiazepines. Slow taper is the way to get off benzodiazepines and any abrupt cut back in doses can trigger adverse withdrawal symptoms (not that they will be completely avoided by tapering). After the months of gradually lowering dosages your recovery will continue for some more time as your brain and body heal from the 4 years of treatment. I suggest you read this article http://prescription-drug.addictionblog.org/what-your-doctors-or-alexander-zaitchik-wont-tell-you-about-benzo-withdrawal/ written by our contributor who went through benzo withdrawal herself to get a better idea of what’s awaiting ahead. Mike 2:13 am                    November 24th, 2015 If I took a half of xanx bar and never took them before. I have a urine test in 10 days.will it be out? Addiction Blog 3:52 pm                    November 24th, 2015 Hi Mike. Well, Xanax is one of the drugs that doesn’t clear very quickly from the body. Depending on the dosage, and the time of use, Xanax can be detected up to six weeks in urine tests. Also, it stays in the blood for several days. Mia 4:55 am                    February 20th, 2017 I have bp issues, primarily at night just before bedtime, and constant pulsatile tinnitus which keeps me up night. Two months ago my doctor prescribed .25 mg of Xanax to take at bedtime to help with the anxiety that these two issues cause. The Xanax helps with the anxiety about the higher nighttime bp, and dulls the pulsatile tinnitus to the point where I can sleep. I do not take it at any other time of the day, nor do I feel the need to. My concern is whether or not this is dangerous and addictive. I hope someone can offer me some advice here. Thanks.

Learn What You Can Do   Addiction to Xanax (Alprazolam) Xanax is a powerful benzodiazepine that is often prescribed to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorders and insomnia. It is extremely addictive when used long-term. Xanax is the number one prescribed psychiatric medication in the United States. Seventy percent of teens with a Xanax addiction get the drug from their family’s medicine cabinet. Tolerance to Xanax develops quickly, requiring the user to take more of the drug to achieve the desired effects. Someone with a Xanax addiction may take up to 20 to 30 pills per day. If the user decides to stop taking Xanax, they may experience withdrawal effects, such as tremors, fatigue and impaired coordination. The onset of withdrawal symptoms is a sign that a physical dependence has developed. The development of tolerance and withdrawal are indications of addiction . Once a Xanax addiction has taken hold, daily responsibilities, such as school, work or family, are ignored as energy is redirected towards drug seeking behavior. Questions about treatment?

The symptoms of Xanax withdrawal are similar to those of alcohol or barbiturate withdrawal, and the severity of the symptoms can vary. If convulsions occur, withdrawal from Xanax can be deadly. Normally, the withdrawal process involves slowly reducing the dosage of Xanax and eventually switching the user to a long-acting form of the drug for a period of time. The gradual taper of this drug helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms. Understanding Xanax Xanax is the brand name for alprazolam, a prescription sedative in the benzodiazepines family. Benzodiazepines were originally developed as a replacement for barbiturates. Xanax affects the brain and central nervous system (CNS). It boosts a brain chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which slows down the nerve cell activity in the brain. The result is a calm and relaxed feeling. Because Xanax is a CNS depressant, common effects of the drug include slurred speech, loss of coordination and disorientation. Xanax is dispensed in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg strengths. The pills come in different shapes and colors depending on strength. The 2 mg tablets are white and rectangular in shape. The rest are oval shaped and colored white (0.25 mg), orange (0.5 mg) or blue (1 mg). Xanax is a regulated schedule IV controlled substance. After taking Xanax, the peak effects of the drug are typically felt within one to two hours. As an intermediate-duration drug, Xanax stays in a person’s system for 12 to 15 hours.

However, those who follow a prescription can still become addicted to Xanax. Xanax may be abused in several ways, including: Taking multiple pills Injecting it Snorting it Taking it via blotter paper Taking it with other drugs or alcohol Xanax is typically abused because of the sense of calm and relaxation it causes in the user. Some people abuse Xanax by taking it in higher doses and combining it with other drugs or alcohol in order to achieve the desired high. They say drugs fill a void, or at least that’s what my therapist thinks. The first time I popped a Xanax was the first time I felt relief from my anxiety disorder…There was something oddly comforting about Xanax—the way it came in many shapes and colors, like peach and blue. I enjoyed looking at the pills. They were a pretty little assortment of happiness I could feel just by holding in my hands. Although Xanax put a temporary stop to my agony, it soon introduced a new kind.  - Former benzo addict Ashley Zlatopolsky, Salon.com, 2015 See how Jerry overcame his addiction.  Watch Jerry's Story An overdose on Xanax can be fatal, especially if the drug is taken with alcohol or other drugs . Overdose can also occur if the pills are crushed or chewed, as the drug is designed to be time-released into the system. Xanax overdose symptoms include: Confusion Slowed heart rate Extreme drowsiness Difficulty breathing Fainting Loss of balance Muscle weakness Coma Treatment for a Xanax overdose will depend on how much of the drug was taken and whether other drugs or alcohol were also taken. In the event of an overdose, medical providers may pump the stomach to remove as much of the unabsorbed Xanax as possible. Medications, such as flumazenil, may also be administered as an antidote. Doctors may insert an IV to provide necessary fluids. It is important for anyone suffering from an overdose to be honest with the emergency medical personnel about exactly what substances were taken and how much. Common Xanax Drug Combinations Xanax is commonly used in combination with alcohol or other pills—particularly opiates—to get a better high. Heroin users regularly consume Xanax, as do methadone users. In addition, approximately 40 percent of alcoholics regularly abuse Xanax. Alcohol is particularly dangerous when mixed with Xanax because they are both depressants, which can lead to an overdose and respiratory failure. Get started on the road to recovery.

Signs and Symptoms Effects of Xanax Abuse Xanax Abuse Treatment Teen Xanax Abuse   What Is Xanax?   Even people who take the medication exactly as prescribed can become addicted to it without realizing it.  Xanax is the trade name of the prescription medication alprazolam , and is in a category of drugs known as benzodiazepines . Typically, doctors prescribe Xanax to treat patients suffering from anxiety and panic disorders .  The medication works by interacting with a receptor in the brain that in turn increases inhibitory brain activity, thus tempering any problematic excitement related to anxiety .  As a fast-acting drug, the majority of the benefits are established within an hour after use, with the total duration of effect being at least 6 hours. Xanax is commonly abused by those seeking it for its sedative effects.  Xanax is especially addictive when misused (taken recreationally or other than as directed). Anyone can become addicted to Xanax. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Xanax use can result in tolerance, addiction, and dependence if taken in large quantities or used for a prolonged period.  Even people who take the medication exactly as prescribed can become addicted to it without realizing it.       1-888-744-0069   Treatment Advisors Are On Call 24/7   Who Answers?    Thinking About Getting Rehab?         Signs and Symptoms    Other Names for Xanax   Alprazolam – The chemical name for the drug.  Niravam – A variation of alprazolam that dissolves on the tongue rather than needing to be swallowed with water.   Street names include:   Xannies/Zannies.  Handlebars/Bars.  Blue footballs.  Benzos.   Symptoms and signs of Xanax abuse can be both physical and mental. Physical Signs and Symptoms Physical symptoms may include:  Feelings of elation.  Drowsiness.  Sleeping for extended periods of time.  Light-headedness.  Difficulty concentrating.  Problems with memory.  Sluggishness.  Nausea.  Headache.  Mental and Social Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of Xanax abuse typically can infiltrate nearly all aspects of a person's life. It is common for people with Xanax problems to have strained relationships with close friends and family, as well as marital problems. Professional issues are also common, as those struggling with a Xanax dependence will often miss work due to them not feeling well, especially if they are unable to take Xanax and experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Other common signs of a Xanax addiction include financial problems . Finances can suffer due to spending increased amounts of money on the substance, or dedicating time to obtaining more drug that would otherwise be spent more productively. Additionally, someone that is overusing Xanax will appear excessively tired and lethargic while lacking the motivation to engage in normal activities of daily life. They will show signs of lower interest in tasks that require sustained attention . Benzodiazepine drugs can have an amnestic effect, making it quite easy for individuals abusing them to forget the fine details of important conversations or tasks that need to be performed. You might find yourself thinking about how you are going to get more Xanax when you have finished what you have. You could develop cognitive problems that make it difficult for you to articulate your words. Addicts also tend to build up a tolerance to Xanax. This means that more of the substance is required to achieve a similar effect to when it was first used. In addition, those people dependent on the drug will experience withdrawal symptoms when they are not taking the medication. An addict's life begins to revolve around drug use, and it is common for users to start taking other drugs when they do not have access to Xanax. Effects of Xanax Abuse Using Xanax, especially for a prolonged period, can have numerous negative effects on your body. The medication is a central nervous system depressant, which means that it slows down aspects of your mental and physical health. The most common effects of Xanax use include:  Lack of coordination.  Slurred speech.  Confusion.  Disorientation.  Xanax is known to slow down respiratory rates of people that abuse the substance. Alone, this can be dangerous as your breathing slows, but the situation becomes more troubling when the substance is mixed with alcohol . Since they are both depressants, their combined effect could lead to serious injury, coma, or death . Some people develop memory impairment , which typically only affects the short-term memory. Sedation is also a concern for Xanax users. People who take the medication in large doses might experience severe sedation that can last for 3-4 days.  Xanax addiction is a widespread problem and affects the lives of numerous adults. Because the addiction develops over time, it may take some time before you even realize that you have a problem.  According to the 2011 Treatment Episode Data Set Report, 60,200 people obtaining drug abuse treatment were addicted to benzodiazepines .  This showed a drastic increase from the 22,400 people who sought treatment for benzodiazepine addictions in 1998.  Xanax Abuse Treatment People dealing with tolerance, addiction, and dependence to Xanax must always seek professional treatment to safely end use of the drug. Sudden unsupervised cessation of Xanax use is related to many unpleasant, if not dangerous withdrawal effects—including seizures . Depending on the level of your dependence, the duration of the addiction, and your general physical health, an inpatient treatment program may be the most appropriate option.  Inpatient treatment programs give you a stable and temptation-free environment for your recovery. Centers have around-the-clock care. The medical staff will help you cope with your withdrawal symptoms and may administer medication to make the [//www.drugabuse.com/library/sedative-abuse-detox/] detoxification symptoms [/link] subside until the drug is completely cleared from your system.  It's not too late to get help. Treatment is available.  Rather than ending the medication suddenly, a medical professional may wean you from the drug by reducing the dose on a regular basis until you no longer take Xanax. A typical day in an inpatient facility could include:  Addiction education.  Individual and group therapy sessions.  Relapse prevention techniques / skills training.   Outpatient treatment programs allow people to reside at their homes for the duration of recovery treatment. There are few typical variants on the type of outpatient programs that are offered. A daily check-in program requires you to check in with a drug abuse counselor every day, while the more intensive outpatient, day treatment and partial hospitalization programs can require you to be at the center for a set number of hours each day. Similar therapeutic interventions will be employed in both outpatient and residential treatment programs, including ongoing behavioral therapy sessions and possibly educational lectures about addiction and recovery. Many treatment options exist outside of the professional setting with community-based treatment and 12-step meetings being successful ways to end your relationship with the substance. Teen Xanax Abuse Xanax abuse is not only a problem among adults; teenagers have prescription medication addictions as well. According to the 2014 Monitoring the Future survey, 13.9% of teenagers report using prescription drugs for non-medical purposes in the past year. While this includes other prescription drugs, Xanax seems to be a quite popular prescription drug abused by teens. Xanax is also monitored in the tranquilizer category by the same survey. These data illustrate that tranquilizer use is showing some mild declines in the years between 2011 and 2014 across 8 th , 10 th , and 12 th graders sampled.

How to Tell If You or a Loved One Is Addicted Paying for Treatment Getting Treatment and Starting Recovery Short- and Long-Term Side Effects of Xanax Dependency Find a Treatment Program for Xanax Addiction    html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"     Are You Addicted to Xanax?  Xanax (alprazolam) is a central nervous system depressant prescribed for the treatment of anxiety, including generalized and social anxiety disorders as well as panic disorder.    Is Xanax Addictive?  When taken in short-term therapeutic doses under the care of a physician,Xanax has a low risk of addiction or dependence.  However, using the drug long-term, taking high doses and mixing the drug with other depressants can hasten the onset of psychological and physical dependence and increases the risk of experiencing serious and sometimes life-threatening withdrawal symptoms. 1  Xanax has a high potential for abuse due to its pleasurable, sedating effects on the central nervous system. Even people who use Xanax for a short time and take it as prescribed may be at risk of dependence. People who are prescribed doses greater than 4mg per day and for longer than 12 weeks may be at greater risk of dependence. 1  Some people who abuse Xanax may take several pills at once or crush the pills into a powder and snort them to speed the onset of effects. Both of these methods of abuse increase the risk of dependency and addiction.  Withdrawal Symptoms  Repeated, heavy and long-term use causes significant changes in the brain and body. When people develop physical dependence, they may experience a number of withdrawal symptoms when they try to quit or cut back on Xanax use. Because of the severity of the withdrawal symptoms, Xanax can be difficult to quit. 1  Some of the withdrawal symptoms associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal can be dangerous. People who have been abusing Xanax heavily for a long period of time should seek medical supervision for detox and withdrawal.  Common withdrawal symptoms include: 1       Dysphoria, ranging from mild to severe.  Loss or decrease of appetite.  Heightened sensory perception.  Pins and needles sensation on skin.  Sweating.  Muscle cramps.  Vomiting.  Stomach cramps.  Diarrhea.      Blurred vision.  Impaired concentration.  Depression.  Suicidal thoughts.  Rebound anxiety symptoms.  Agitation.  Muscle twitching.  Tremors.  Seizures.         How to Tell If You or a Loved One Is Addicted   Some people may not recognize they have a problem because they were prescribed the drug.  Xanax addiction can be challenging for people who abuse the drug. Their use can affect their loved ones as well. Some people may not recognize they have a problem because a physician prescribed them the drug.  If you or someone you love is using Xanax, it is important to be mindful of the signs and symptoms of addiction so you can recognize them and seek treatment if possible.  Common symptoms of Xanax addiction are: 1,3       Inability to discuss use without becoming defensive.  Needing more of the drug to achieve the same effect.  Using the drug in a way other than prescribed (i.e., snorting, injecting, mixing with other drugs, etc.).  Making excuses to use the drug.  Needing the drug to function.      Neglecting to eat.  Inability to stop or control use even if desired.  Failure to maintain personal and professional commitments and responsibilities.  Missing important activities due to drug use.  Secretive behavior.  Continuing to use despite any harm it may cause.     If you or someone you love exhibits any of the above symptoms of Xanax addiction, it is crucial to seek treatment as soon as possible. Do not attempt to quit alone since some withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, can be life-threatening. It is important to detox under the supervision of a medical professional who can safely manage the effects of withdrawal while the drug is slowly tapered off.

You are typically charged on a per diem basis.     Whether you are treated at an inpatient or an outpatient facility : Inpatient treatment is frequently more expensive than outpatient and may not be fully covered by insurance.     Where you stay: Both the location of the facility and the facility itself can affect your out-of-pocket cost. Cost of treatment varies from state to state and your insurance coverage may vary for in- and out-of-network providers. Some treatment programs are more expensive than others because they offer private rooms, luxury amenities and other specialty services. Do some research to determine which facility is best suited for your needs and your budget.     Unfortunately, the cost of a Xanax rehab program can be a barrier for many people who need help. Options for financing treatment include:      Health insurance: Some rehabs accept insurance as a form of payment. Many insurance plans do not cover 100% of treatment costs, so you may still have out-of-pocket costs. The Affordable Care Act requires that Medicaid plans and those offered on the health insurance marketplace offer coverage for substance abuse disorders. If you are not insured, go to your state insurance website to see if you are eligible for any plans.     Personal savings : Using some of your savings to pay for treatment can be a good investment. Getting help for addiction can improve the quality of your life and can help you earn and save more money in the long run due to the costs of addiction.     Payment plans and sliding scale rates : Many treatment facilities offer payment plans either in-house or through a third-party lender. Contact the facility you are interested in to see if they have installment plans available for funding treatment. Some treatment facilities offer sliding scale rates for those struggling to afford treatment.     Loans: Consider taking out a bank loan to help you cover the cost of treatment. Find the lowest interest rate possible and make sure that you can afford the monthly payments.     Credit cards: Credit cards are another method of paying for treatment. Again, make sure the interest rates and minimum payments are within your budget.     Borrowing : Ask a family member or a friend for a personal loan to help you cover the costs of treatment.     Crowdfunding . Crowdfunding sites (i.e., GoFundMe ) let you request donations from family, friends and others. You may be surprised at how many people will help support your recovery.     Sell assets : You may want to consider selling valuable assets such as vehicles, boats or jewelry to help fund the cost of treatment. You can always purchase more items following treatment.     Churches and nonprofit organizations : Many churches and charities offer free or low-cost treatment services for drug addiction.     If you are uninsured and concerned about financing your addiction treatment, you can call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) 24/7 national helpline for assistance and information at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).    Getting Treatment and Starting Recovery  When you're ready to get help for Xanax addiction, you'll want to consider the many different treatment options available. Each person is unique and may have developed an addiction to Xanax for different reasons. Finding the right program that meets your needs and budget is crucial.  Typical treatment options for Xanax addiction include: 2,5     Inpatient treatment:Inpatient treatment occurs in a 24-hour residential facility. Treatment programs are highly structured and designed to provide maximum support for recovery. Treatment ranges from 30 to 90 days and may be longer in severe cases. Inpatient treatment for Xanax addiction usually includes some combination of medically supervised detox, counseling, therapy, 12-step or other support groups, relapse prevention and aftercare planning.    Outpatient treatment  12-step programs: support and structure through a step-by-step process toward recovery  Teen treatment: unique issues teenagers with addiction face.  Dual diagnosis treatment:   Cognitive behavioral therapy:  2 Other things you'll want to consider when choosing an addiction treatment center are:     Program philosophy: Look for a treatment center whose philosophy and values are in alignment with your own. If you don't believe in the center's approach to addiction and treatment, it could hinder your chance of recovery. For example, if you are a Christian, a bible-based treatment center may be best suited for you. On the other hand, if you don't hold any religious beliefs, you would likely be better suited for a secular treatment center instead of a faith-based one.     Program accreditation: Research and learn about the accreditation of the treatment facility you want to attend. Accreditation holds facilities accountable to certain standards and state licensing requirements that help ensure you receive quality care.     Qualifications of staff: Choose a facility with a highly qualified staff that includes psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, counselors, recovery coaches and other professionals you may need, such as spiritual leaders, massage therapists and acupuncturists.     Location: Consider the location of the facility as well. Do you want to be close to home so that friends and family can visit or would you benefit from a facility far from home? You will also want to consider whether your insurance covers treatment in that state as well.     Short- and Long-Term Side Effects of Xanax Dependency Common side effects of Xanax abuse are due to the drug's effect on gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that slows activity throughout the brain. Xanax increases the activity of GABA, which slows nerve impulses. 9 Short-term side effects of Xanax abuse include: 1      Drowsiness.  Dizziness.  Slurred speech.  Poor coordination.  Irritability.  Nausea and vomiting.  Upset stomach.  Dry mouth or increased saliva.  Confusion.  Memory problems.      Difficulty concentrating.  Loss of libido.  Blurred and double vision.  Tremors.  Unsteady gait.  Slowed reaction time.  Heart palpitations.  Low blood pressure.  Fainting.     More serious potential long-term effects of Xanax abuse that may occur include: 6,7,8,9    Depression.    Physical dependence, tolerance and withdrawal.    Cognitive impairments.    Aggressive behavior.    Slurred speech.     Find a Treatment Program for Xanax Addiction If you or a loved one is struggling with Xanax addiction, don't hesitate to reach out for help.
