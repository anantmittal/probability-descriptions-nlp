years from now according to British actuary Benjamin Gompertz in 1825; it's called
the "Gompertz Law of human mortality." Your probability of dying during a given year
doubles every 8 years.

(Image courtesy of Flickr user Brimstone , under a Creative Commons license)   It happened to actress Ingrid Bergman, women's rights activist Betty Friedan, and — tradition has it — William Shakespeare. They all died on their birthdays, and new research finds the typically joyous day turns out to be more tragic than expected for some.  The average death rate on people's birthdays is 6.7 percent higher than what you'd otherwise normally expect on that day, according to a new analysis from University of Chicago economics researcher Pablo Pena. The rate is even higher for young people and on weekends, he finds.  Pena analyzed Social Security Administration records for 25 million people who died between 1998 and 2011. Births and deaths don't happen evenly across the year, so Pena's analysis controls for seasonal patterns by comparing birthday death rates to what would be expected on a given day.  The Social Security records themselves don't provide information on the cause of deaths or characteristics of the departed. But some patterns do emerge.  For instance, young people between 20-29 years old have an excess death rate of 25.4 percent —perhaps a sign of birthday celebrations gone wrong. Excess death rates are slightly higher for birthdays falling on weekends across all age groups, Pena's the analysis finds, while the excess death rate for 20-29 year olds almost doubles to 48.3 percent.   The study isn't the first to cast a sad shadow on birthday celebrations. A 2012 study in the journal Annals of Epidemiology found a much higher probability (about 14 percent) that people over 60 will die on their birthdays. That study , which analyzed more than 2 million deaths, found that strokes and heart attacks rose 18.6 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, on birthdays. Tragically, the study also found a 34.9 percent increase in suicides and a 44 increase in deaths from falls.  Pena, whose results will be published in the February 2015 issue of Social Science & Medicine, writes that his study sample is about 10 times larger than the 2012 study. He says further research is needed into what's behind the link between birthdays and deaths, such as the causes and the socioeconomic factors, to drive a potential policy response to prevent these deaths.  "In principle, those policies could be as simple as campaigns to increase awareness of the risks associated with changes in behaviors on or around birthdays," he writes.  In other words, celebrate responsibly.                     Jason Millman covers all things health policy, with a focus on Obamacare implementation. He previously covered health policy for Politico.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic.

About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.

A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason?

Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8.

Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.       A 3D look at the HIV virus.  Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock    On other fronts, modern medicine is helping people manage their maladies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.       A 3D look at the HIV virus.  Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock    On other fronts, modern medicine is helping people manage their maladies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.       A 3D look at the HIV virus.  Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock    On other fronts, modern medicine is helping people manage their maladies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.

Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car.

Noah Davis calculates the odds of his demise on an ordinary day in New York City. Author: Noah Davis Publish date: Nov 21, 2013 Social count: 0 0 SHARES (PHOTO: DARKGEOMETRYSTUDIOS/ SHUTTERSTOCK ) Late last week, I found myself reading an article in The New York Times detailing one artist-turned-activist&apos;s plan to give Swiss citizens a monthly check for being alive. Cut to Monday morning, and I find out that the world will end on February 22, courtesy of the Norse god Odin&apos;s death at the hands of Fenrir the wolf. (Or something along those lines. Perhaps not coincidentally, the 30th Jorvik Viking Festival is also scheduled for the 22nd. So I don&apos;t know, mark your calendars?) Advertisement THANKS FOR WATCHING! VISIT WEBSITE Because my brain works in strange ways and/or because I spend most of my days sitting at home, staring out at the window trying to think about things to write, these two stories got me wondering when I was going to die. The Internet will give you a wide variety of answers. Death-clock.org said I had until Tuesday, November 30, 2060. DeathTimer.com chopped off 11 years—November 12, 2049, specifically—and listed my cause of death as a fight with Chuck Norris. If I get killed by a 109-year-old Chuck Norris, so be it. Also: Screw you, DeathTimer.com. A site affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania&apos;s Wharton School of Business had a remarkably complex survey and ultimately decided that I would meet my doom on August 2, 2063. TheDeathClock.com came with a malware warning. Since my untimely demise is what was being considered, not that of my already failing MacBook, I closed that tab. Advertisement THANKS FOR WATCHING! VISIT WEBSITE Advertisement THANKS FOR WATCHING! VISIT WEBSITE That was a fun exercise but so abstract. The better question, or at least the more relevant one to me, right now in this moment, is what are the chances that I&apos;m going to die today? I don&apos;t live a particularly dangerous life, but nearly everything we do has inherent risks, right? Could today be the day? Let&apos;s try to find out. (If you&apos;d like more, there&apos;s a book about such matters and Pacific Standard interviewed one of the writers over the summer.) These two stories got me wondering when I was going to die. FIRST, SOME OF THE obvious risks. I have to take the subway to Harlem later tonight. In 2012, 55 people died on the tracks (up from eight in 2011), but there were 1,654,582,265 total riders. That’s about one death for every 30 million riders and about one death per week. I might take a taxi back from Harlem. Seventy-three people lost their lives in traffic accidents in New York City in 2012, which, while tragic, is a low number considering there are more than 27 million taxi rides alone in a single year. That doesn&apos;t include the number of regular cars, livery cabs, buses, etc. Odds of dying in a traffic fatality today are well into the millions to one. It&apos;s actually considerably more dangerous to walk, as 148 pedestrians died in 2012, but that is still extremely unlikely. Biking would be another risk, with 18 cyclists dying in 2012, but biking is actually getting safer as awareness grows. There&apos;s always the chance, albeit a vanishingly small one, that I could fall into the Gowanus Canal while riding my bike over one of the bridges. While no one is exactly sure what would happen if I drank some of the water and while it wouldn&apos;t be a good thing for my health, it probably wouldn&apos;t kill me. So that&apos;s not a worry. That third arm I grow, however.... I might get a call from an editor about a story and need to get on a plane immediately. (Hey anonymous editors, are you reading?) The annual risk of being killed in a plane crash is about one in 11 million, but that generalizes over the entire population. A NOVA investigation pegged the figure for someone like me who flies fairly frequently—at around one in two million. But that&apos;s yearly, not daily, so the chance that today would be the day is obviously smaller. Speaking of unlikely, I spent Saturday at Princeton where there&apos;s a meningitis outbreak . Bloomberg informs me that 10 percent of the student body is carrying the bacteria but only one in 1,000 are getting sick. Still, up to 10 percent of people with symptoms die within 48 hours. I haven&apos;t started coughing yet, so I figure I&apos;m clear at least until Wednesday. I&apos;m playing squash this evening, and there&apos;s always the chance of a sudden cardiac incident. They are rare in 31-year-olds, and I haven&apos;t shown any warning signs, but these things come out of nowhere. I couldn&apos;t find any odds, but one group estimated that 10.1 in every one million participants would suffer a sports-related death. It&apos;s about lunchtime now—I want to be properly fed for my game this evening—and in recent months, I&apos;ve choked a few separate times because I eat too quickly and I am a moron. Odds of dying in a given year from choking on food are one in 370,035. Multiple that by 365 and I have a roughly one in 135 million chance of dying today from choking on food. But, again, I&apos;m kind of dumb that way and have a history of choking, so let&apos;s bump it up to one in 100 million. Still not likely. I could continue for quite some time while trying to determine the ways I&apos;ll die today but spending too much time on the Internet is bad for my health. There are always more things that are causes for concern , unseen forces that could send me flying off this mortal coil. But, thankfully, my impending doom doesn&apos;t seem too likely. In other words, I will probably live to see another day. Bring it on Walker, Texas Ranger.

These, I submit, are among the most optimistic people on Earth, because they look at odds of 1 in 195,249,054 and still envision themselves winning.   Yet some of these people play the other side of much shorter odds, walking outside in a thunderstorm, ignoring bees buzzing flowerbeds, riding bicycles, and going for a swim, all apparently comfortable in the odds against such activities bringing them harm. They might not be so confident if they knew the true odds.

S. Army, Infantry, Drill Sergeant, NCOIC Ft Lee Ops & Trg · Author has 376 answers and 2m answer views Whether or not you get deployed into a war-zone plays a large role in probability of death. I'm assuming you indeed are interested in probability of death in a war-zone. Let me use the Iraq War as a case study. Let me start with this: as a whole, you are 2.5 times more likely to die as a US military member than as a healthy, young civilian in the United States (Preston and Buzzel, 2007). Let's break this down further. There are many factors that contribute to risk of death. According to a study conducted by Preston and Buzzel in 2007, the following factors significantly affect risk of death: (1) branch of service, (2) component of service, (3) rank, and (4) age and sex. I will break down each of these four factors in the following paragraphs. 1. Branch of Service . Branch of service is broken down into Army, Marines, Air Force, and Navy (the Coast Guard was not included in this study). If you are a Marine, you are 2 times more likely to die compared to the Army, 10 times more likely to die when compared to the Navy, and 20 times more likely to die when compared to the Air Force. In fact, if you are in the Navy or Air Force, you have a much lower death rate than a healthy, young civilian in the United States. 2. Component of Service. This pertains to whether or not you are in Active Duty, Reserves, or National Guard. Death rates for Active Duty Army soldiers are 3 times more than Reserve Army soldiers. Army National Guard has an intermediate risk of death. Marines have a high risk of death regardless of component. 3. Rank. Enlisted men have 40% higher mortality rates than Officers. There are exceptions to this though. Army Lieutenants have a 19% higher mortality rate compared to all Army troops combined. Marine Lieutenants have a 11% higher mortality rate compared to all Marines. 4. Age and Sex. Younger military personnel have a higher chance of dying. Males are 5.5 times more likely at risk of dying compared to females. It's interesting to note that Marines are disproportionately young. 64.7% of Marines deployed to Iraq were aged 24 and younger, compared to the Army's 39.5% To sum everything up, if you're young, male, a Marine, and enlisted, you have the highest chance of dying. If you're a young male in the Army or Army National Guard, you have a moderate chance of dying. If you're in the Air Force or Navy, you have a low chance of dying. If you are female, you have a lower chance of dying. I hope this answer paints a clear picture for you. 317.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question Quora User Answered May 20, 2015 · Author has 191 answers and 112.4k answer views I think that it's more dependent on who you're at war with than what branch you're in. I mean, on the surface you would think that infantry, marines, they would get mowed down.  And generally they do, not the supply clerks and nurses, but grunts that didn't do to great on the asvab. Then, what about these modern wars where you're fighting among these lands that have been redirected to go through another pre-industrial age?  If you're in the Navy and not a bomber pilot, you're probably not going to get killed.  It's the twenty year old running around the depleted uranium-saturated streets that's going to get it. So, what if it's not war with the peasants?  In the World Wars whole ships filled with people in the Navy were killed at once.  The United States built Liberty Ships, shitty, low-quality, high-volume pigs that planners assume would be sunk in vast quantities.  There were no illusions. In fact, I've read that if you were in one of the countries involved in the European theater, it wasn't a bad idea to be in the ground forces because there all the civilians were getting vaporized, blown to bits, and incinerated too. Of course, if we went to war with Russia then a majority of officers flying an F-22 would not come back.  All of them flying a JSF-35 (is it in service?) would be dead.  Possibly all the Air Force guys at bases where they're launching F-22's would be bombed and strafed after all the F-22's had been blown out of the sky.  Maybe the infantry guys would get together with the Russian guys and watch the mess play out above.  "How long did yours go to college?  Ours are there for four years." And the Navy at war with Russia... everyone on those aircraft carriers would be a bit more nervous than when it's the peasant opposing force. So: Peasant enemy, combat MOS infantry and Marines.  Second world enemy, Navy sailors and officers alike and Air Force officers. Disclaimer: I know, we're not really fighting peasants.  We're just weaving in and out of peasants where the bad guys are hiding, dressed as peasants.  I mean no offense by pointing out the difference between a peasant army and a big army that is wearing matching costumes. 21.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

According to the latest statistics I could find: In 2009, there were 1,519 active duty deaths.  The highest percentage of those deaths were due to accidents, 28.5 per 100,000.  They do not differentiate between alcohol related accidents and normal accidents.  21.5/100,000 were due to hostile actions. There were about 1.6 million active duty members that year. For comparison, an average of 1,825 college students die each year from only alcohol related incidents alone.

Allen Inks , former Electrician's Mate First Class - EM1 (SS) at United States Navy (1972-1980) Answered Jul 13, 2016 · Author has 1.4k answers and 1.5m answer views Originally Answered: If war broke out in the US, which Branch of the military would you be more likely to survive in? EDIT: The question changed; it originally was asking about survival chances in various military branches if “war broke out in the US”. I’ve not got enough time to change the answer to fit the new question. Okay, “War broke out in the US” is kind of vague. Do you mean A) civil war , for example, another civil war between Republicans and Democrats? Do you mean B) war with a foreign power inside the US, as in Canada and Mexico go in cahoots to attack and invade the US? Or do you mean C) nuclear war, as in one of the Kims fulfills the dynasty’s self-destructive tendencies, and launches several nuclear missiles at the US, which in turn, turns that failing country into a nice pristine glass parking lot for KIA and Hyundai factory overflow - which in turns results in some further nuclear missile strikes against the US from another country…who shall remain nameless? Note that I am assuming that option A is non-nuclear - though sometimes from the rhetoric from the far right and the far left, I’m not sure. I wish everyone would just wise up, vote Libertarian, and leave the Democratic and Republican parties on the ash heaps of history, but … I digress. A) In the case of a civil war, I will assume that the main purpose of the Republican and Democratic Navies will be to blockade the coasts of the land held by the other side, and to break the Naval blockades of the other side. I expect that the naval nuclear weapon assets controlled by each side will be sent to far-flung bases to wait out the war, and that we will be smart enough (or at least military leaders will be… I can’t vouch for ANY of the politicians) to not target things like nuclear weapons storage facilities, Minuteman missile silos, or nuclear power plants. The Air Force, Army and Marines will likely be highly involved. Likewise, Coast Guard highly involved doing blockade work (but lacking subs or significant anti-submarine capability, will mostly be targets for submarines). Best bet for survival: Navy. B) In the case of invasion by the frozen Canadians and the highly motivated Mexicans (NOTE TONGUE FIRMLY IN CHEEK - this is hypothetical and I’m just teasing our friends across the borders - actually, I know of at least 4 Canadians who are partially defrosted.) Again, I would expect the Army and Marines to be highly involved in repulsing those dastardly foes from our hallowed soil. Lots of bullets flying on all three sides… The Air Force should be flying tactical support for our ground troops… but by this time will probably have retired the A-10 (not sexy enough a mission for the Generals), so they will be flying F-35s and F-22’s to gain air superiority, and finding out that the F-35 makes a shitty replacement for an A-10. Hopefully, the Marines will have plenty of their planned V-22 Osprey gunship variants to augment Army helicopter crews to support the ground pounders. The Air Force will also be using B-52s that are on Medicare and collecting Social Security to support the troops using smart bombs, and using B2’s to bomb Ottawa, Mexico City, and other strategic location… but sparing important cultural sites like Senor Frog’s in Los Cabos. The Coast Guard….guarding the coasts to prevent opening a third or fourth front…likely, not too too involved. Maybe some riverine warfare. Navy…. using aircraft carriers to assist our North American Free Trade partners that they really want to go back home, or there won’t be a home to go back to. Best bet for survival: Coast Guard… followed by Navy. C) Multiple Exchange Massive Nuclear war: Substantially everybody dies. Best bet for being amongst the last to die: Submarine crew (Navy) or Minute Man Missile launch officers (Air Force). My best guess would be the Navy would be the last to go… more mobility to avoid fallout (authority for this “guess” - “On the Beach” (book or movie)). My advice re nuclear weapons sounds just like Nancy Reagan’s advice on drugs, “Just Say No”. Funny coming from a guy who spent 4 years living amongst 16 thermonuclear tipped SLBMs, doing his part to make sure my sub was ready when the call came, right? Nope… not funny. 27.9k Views · View Upvoters   Riccardo P , studied at University of Zurich Answered May 25, 2017 Eric Tang answered this question and got a lot of upvotes.

Eric, I really have nothing personally against you or anyone else that wrote something similar here, but honestly, this is one of the most misleading statements I ever heard/read. Please STOP fooling young people with this kind of statements. It highly suggest to enroll in Military because you may apparently live longer! But this is very obviously big b#$@=%÷! To enroll in Military means (1.) to become a killer and (2.) to be exposed to a much higher probability to die young if you are sent to a war zone. How much higher the probability is, is less important in my opinion. But it certainly is higher if you “play around” with arms. I mean, even the government tells you not to travel in war zones . Why? Because it is dangerous. You could die. Higher risk to die. I would really not trust any statistics that suggest that the probability to die is lower if you enroll yourself in Military. 1.9k Views · View Upvoters   Gary Leverich , worked at U.S. Marine Corps Answered May 15, 2015 · Upvoted by Quora User , Hobby Farmer, Amateur Brewer, Retired US Army Cavalry Scout · Author has 472 answers and 2.9m answer views Combat is of course risky.  But most of the military never sees actual combat, they serve in support roles.  Even support roles carry their own level of risk.  Advanced weaponry is designed to take out support functions.  So working on an airfield well away from actual combat still carries a level of risk.  Other than combat, the highest cause of death in the military (all branches) is alcohol.  I was stationed with the 101st Airborne Division.  That division has a sign at the front of the base (at least used to) counting the days since the last alcohol related traffic death.  If we made it 101 days, we would get a day off.  We rarely made it 101 days. In 15 years of service, including 6 years in the Marine Corps with 2 combat deployments, and 9 in the Army with one peacekeeping mission, I lost 1 soldier.  That's because he wrapped his car around a tree after a weekend binge. 44.9k Views · View Upvoters   Daniel Kearns , former Paratrooper 82nd Airborne at U.S. Army Answered Mar 25, 2013 · Author has 1k answers and 4.8m answer views Generally, it matters not which branch you pick. What matters is what job you pick in that branch. Known as an MOS (Military Occupation Specialty), some are much more dangerous than others. For example, 11B Infantry is an MOS in the US Army that would be considered much more dangerous than say 36B Financial Management Technician.  There would be very few, (read: no), instances where a 36B might see combat. In todays US Army, virtually every Regular Army 11B will see some variation of combat at some point. Every US Military Branch has jobs known as Combat Arms.  These jobs will always be more dangerous than Support jobs. 36k Views · View Upvoters   Clell Harmon , Retired USN.

Young men, no matter how intelligent they are, are prone to being stupid.  The proximity of other young men amplifies stupidity. Youtube is proof of this, but it existed long before anyone thought about putting videos on the internet. Take poorly maintained cars, an idiot behind the wheel looking to impress his passengers, lubricate with a bit of alcohol and you get dead people. I was in the Navy for more than 20 years. In my time in service, I buried five of my shipmates because of auto accidents.  None to combat, one to catestrophic equipment failure on a Submarine, two to drowning (one 'on duty' and one from being stupidly drunk and finding a rip current), and one to an undiagnosed aneurysm that burst when we were underway. 22.5k Views · View Upvoters   Rachel Bolyard , World traveler, appreciator of well built things Answered May 5, 2017 · Author has 260 answers and 199.2k answer views Your chances of dying in an auto accident are like 2000x higher than dying in any modern combat scenario. You're literally safer in a war zone than driving yourself out for dinner tonight. 30k people die per year in the US driving and 14 soldiers died in combat in 2016. Most jobs in the military, even if you're in a combat zone, don't involve shooting. You may end up with some convoy duty, which is by far the most risky thing to do, because a) it's driving and military vehicles are top heavy, rolling over and killing their operators routinely in training or combat, and b) convoys are symbols of power and occupation therefore insurgents like to target them. Training fatalities in the armed forces are in the hundreds per year per force. The Navy is probably the most dangerous because they have the most machinery and moving parts. Still though, from the stats, you're still safer serving than driving… 1.9k Views · View Upvoters   Jatavius Williams , Been an United States Army Drill Sergeant For 13yrs Now.

The Coast Guard operates under the U.S Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, but can be transferred to the U.S Department of the Navy by Congress or the President. But it is technically part of the military. The Coast Guard would probably be your best bet. In World War II, 241,093 people served in the Coast Guard. Out of the 241,093 people that served, 574 died in action. That’s literally a 0.2% death rate, almost non-existent. However, if we don’t consider the Coast Guard as part of the military, Air Force and Navy would probably be your best bet, especially the Air Force. 10.7k Views · View Upvoters   Christopher Sullivan , works at U.S. Army Answered Jan 25, 2016 · Author has 293 answers and 87.2k answer views It depends on your MOS and where you are deployed to.

I would not agree with with some of the other answers here and claims that “you have a higher chance to die in car crash” - this simply is not true. -So 3 year contract. -Infantry -Situation similar to last decade and a half of Iraq/Afghanistan proportions, in short an insurgency war. Off the bat, in three year congract you should only have enough time to train, get to your unit, deploy one time( 12 months) I’m using approximate numbers as I recall these to be during my time in the service. please find it within yourself to not argue or correct me on every number I chose to use for this approximation. For a war time statistic of active combat action and hostility we could take a situation that I recall being off and on a norm 2005 -2012. So among a force of 100,000 US military Service members deployed 50 are KIA a month. Some months have been better some have been worse. A low 20/30-for a slow month, while on a bad month 100+ ) In addition each month could have 100 more experience loss of limb, severe burns, loss of cognitive function/brain damage, spinal cord injury, complete loss of eye sight… life changing injuries. Plus another 200 service members are wounded to various lesser degrees. These injuries and deaths mainly distributed among combat arms soldiers. Infantry, light mechonised, MPs, combat engineers( route clearance) EOD, JSOC units. Realistically about 30,000- 40,000 out of total troop strength would sponge up most of the casualties and injuries. Let’s say 2/3s of it. So out of 100,000 with focus on 30,000 that have spent a year in combat zone as combat arms soldiers during war time mission 50*(2/3)*12 = 400 would be KIAs 100*(2/3)*12 =800 gravely injured 200*(2/3)*12=1600 non life changing injury( gunshot, concussion, loss of fingers,partial eyesight) While the other 1/3 of deaths and injuries will distribute among cooks, supply, air assets, medics, admin, engineers, mechanics, and on. So, just to ballpark on a single 3 year contract with a 12 month deployment into an active combat zone as we have witnessed over last decade and a half: You have about 1- 1,2% chance of loosing your life. 2–3% chance of being gravely injured. 4–7% of being wounded. So it’s a little above national highway injury statistic but it’s not terribly bad either. All and all your chances of getting “fucked up bad” are below 5% Getting “Hurt” are below 7% On back end, I’d recommend looking up monthly stats for suicides among US combat veterans… it’s somewhat high and troubling. 4.8k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by TruthFinder Have you ever googled yourself?

The probability compared to branches such as the Marines, or the Army are for obvious reasons much lower considered the Air Force is not a “Boots on the ground” oriented branch. However, the chance will ALWAYS be there, because of the nature of the beast. People die from car crashes, freak accidents, the Air Force is not removed from those things. In my career field (Security Forces/Military Police) over a couple of decades we’ve had maybe 12 ish deaths, but if you were to decide to be a Battlefield Airman (PJ, TACP, CCT) you WOULD be the boots on the ground for the Air Force.

Anyways, relative to time and your current existence , I would say there is a 100% inevitability that you will die Today! Yes, you read it right!

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Tokyo  Japan  Death and Dying What is the chance of you dying or being seriously wounded by an earthquake by living in Tokyo? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers   Carlo La Porta , 25 years in Tokyo, 2 years is in Osaka, Fluent Japanese Answered Apr 7, 2016 All things being relative I would say your chances of dying are low, depending on how you interpret the figures. "seriously wounded" is kind of hard to define and I did not have that data at hand. So below text is focused on "chances of dying" only. Around 6000 people died in the Hanshin earthquake in 1995. The population there at the time was around 20 million people, so the chances were about 1 in 3,300. If you look at it from the Kobe perspective, which is a "small" part of the Hanshin area where the epicenter was, about 4000 people died in a population of 1.5 million so the chances then were be about 1 in 375, which considering the fact it was the epicenter is very low in my opinion. Depending on how you define Tokyo (ie just the actual city) or as the area of Kanto (ie the region of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama) numbers will look a little different. Kanto has a population of about 42 million people which has a population density of 1300 people/km2   against Hanshin which as 830/km, so about 1.5 times denser. Based on just this, the chances could then be about 1 in 2, 200 for the Kanto region. Tokyo (the city)'s density is 6,200/km2 against Kobe's circa 2,750/km2, ie circa 2.3 times, so looking at Tokyo one could extrapolate your chances to be about 1 in 170? Having said that there were a number of drastic changes to building regulations across the country after 1995 and a number of issues that caused deaths have been remedied. For example all of the supporting pillars of the highways have been strengthened. Crashed pieces of highways were both direct and indirect cause of death (ambulances and firefighters unable to get to where they needed to) is just one example, so this could mitigate the difference in density. Also the percentage of concrete buildings is higher in Tokyo than it was in Kobe, so fire risks are lesser I think. All in all, I personally feel as safe in Tokyo as I would in any other city if not more. The risk of the earthquake happening where I am and of me dying as a result of that are at least comparable if not lower than to being in a car crash or being shot in other cities ... I hope this helps. 304 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below Is everybody in Tokyo going to die? Why does Tokyo have so many earthquakes? What would be the global impact of a big earthquake in Tokyo? What is it like to live in Japan? Mainly Tokyo? What will living in Tokyo be like in 2020? Ask New Question   Tony Smyth , Author: Fukushima and the Coming Tokyo Earthquake (2011-present) Updated Nov 30, 2017 · Author has 739 answers and 287.8k answer views The last time there was big quake in Tokyo was 1923 (lets ignore 2011 – that was a 5.8 in Tokyo, very scary but not a MAJOR quake, at least not in Tokyo). [ The 1923 earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Tōkyō and four-fifths of Yokohama. At that time, the Tōkyō Metropolitan Area had a population of some 4.4 million, and Yokohama half a million. 142,800 people died. Nearly half of the houses in the two cities were partially or fully destroyed. Property damage came to 2% of Japan's total national wealth. The present-day Greater Tōkyō Area has a population of 35.5 million and a population density of 2,640 persons per square kilometre, easily the most densely populated metropolis in the world. There are far fewer areas of escape now than in the 1920s ]. [One of the scenarios being considered by Japanese seismologists is a quake with its epicentre at the head of Tōkyō Bay. If this was to happen, and the quake was a Richter scale magnitude 7 or greater, short tremor cycles (the most destructive type) would strike below the focal point of Japanese leadership, with very little loss of intensity. In this worst-case scenario, a Richter scale magnitude 9 quake, an estimated 11,000 people would be killed and some 850,000 buildings would collapse or burn down. In 2013, a central government panel forecast that 175,000 older wooden buildings will be destroyed in a magnitude 7 earthquake. Another recent Japanese government report estimated that 58,000 people will be trapped in collapsed structures and that, in major business areas, 11,000 will find themselves stuck in elevators. As many as 2,000 fires will break out simultaneously. Though some may be extinguished by communal efforts, the majority will be beyond the ability of survivors to douse, even if water supplies remain functioning. Up to 410,000 buildings are predicted to be destroyed as fires burn out of control for days]. Oil Refinery in Chiba Prefecture, north of Tokyo in March 2011. It took 10 days to put out the blaze. 24% of Japans GDP comes from two huge industrial zones along both sides of Tokyo Bay, much of it built on reclaimed land. [For many who live and work in the centre of Tōkyō there are few safe areas of escape. Each day, some 3.64 million commuters pass through Shinjuku Station, by a long way the busiest train station in the world, its passages all underground. The wards of central Tōkyō have extremely high population densities, swelling from 13 million to some 16 million during working hours. In 21st-century Tōkyō, the schoolyards and parks designated as special evacuation areas are small. Although the city has 6,000 parks, many are tiny. Tōkyō has the least amount of greenery and park area per head of population of any world city. Moreover, the SEAs are not distributed evenly. The industrial area of Kawasaki that lies between Tōkyō and Yokohama has very little open space, apart from that around one soccer stadium]. Usually a big quake - MAG 6, 7 or over hits Tokyo/Yokohama once every 60–70 years. There hasn’t been one since 1923 so it is long overdue. So to answer your question, the odds of being injured or of dying are much higher than in 1923 simply because there are far fewer areas of escape, and Tokyo/Yokohama is one dense entity- a Metropolis - right out to the mountains. It is far more densely populated than in 1923. How bad it will be will depend on wind velocity and the time of day. Most of those who died in 1923 died from the fires that broke out. 569 Views   Por Phoenix , lived in Tokyo Answered Apr 7, 2016 · Author has 764 answers and 227.8k answer views Unless the quake is so intense, like 7.0 up?

If you watch where you go / know where to take shelter / cover, should be fine. Only some elderly died that day i think. Tokyo is more prepared for earthquake more than you know it. I didn't even get any scratches. I am more concerned about having nothing to eat AFTER the quake. This photo was taken from a nearby mini mart where I tried to stock up some supplies. 486 Views · View Upvoters   Gareth Edwards , lives in Tokyo (1998-present) Answered Jul 15, 2017 The Japanese government’s simulation envisages 23,000 deaths and 610,000 buildings lost due to collapse or fire were a 7.3 magnitude earthquake to hit in the vicinity of Ota ward. These numbers have been criticized for trying to reassure, and failing to factor deaths resulting from (for example) power cuts/fires in underground stations into the numerical estimates. Other estimates (e.g., from the Tokyo metropolitan government) put the death toll lower (9,700) and envisage less property damage, but may be focused more narrowly. Very approximately, the range of estimates seems to be from around 10,000-30,000 dead and around 150,000 injured, out of a population of 13mn (so 13,000 deaths would be 0.1% of the population). Swing factors are going to come from things like weather, the age of the building stock in the particular area, the percentage of older wooden buildings (i.e., fire risk) and so forth. Despite Tokyo’s constant rebuilding, there are older areas with a high density of old wooden houses that could be a source of major fires. It’s also worth noting that several million people are going to have trouble getting home (even after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, train services in Tokyo were shut down and there were incredible traffic jams—resulting in huge crowds of people wrapped in space blankets trudging home). And unlike in the Tohoku earthquake, which caused minimal property damage in Tokyo, a direct hit on the capital could result in a couple of million people bedding down in school halls, gyms etc. Those things represent health risks. Finally, I’d point out that using a 5.0 earthquake as a yardstick for expectations of what would happen in a 7+ is a little dicey - the scale is logarithmic, and the amount of energy released in a 7.0 is 1,000 times that of a 5.0. Friends who survived the 6.9 in Hanshin [1] in 1995 talk about being bounced out of bed, thrown to the ground, and so forth. But in the normal way? You’ll occasionally jump because the earth rumbles at you a bit, and that’s it. For better or worse, earthquakes tend to fall into three categories, in order of frequency: ignorable (most), momentarily scary (occasional), and massive, fatality and recession-inducing monsters (very infrequent).

A Mathematical Puzzle : Krulwich Wonders...  What are the odds that you will die this year? Whatever they are, the mortality tables suggest those odds will double eight years from now. Death, apparently, moves closer at a curiously regular pace. Why this eight-year progression? Is it something biological? Random? What is it about eight that attracts the Grim Reaper? Let's ask.          Am I Going To Die This Year? A Mathematical Puzzle       Krulwich Wonders  Robert Krulwich On Science           Facebook         Am I Going To Die This Year? A Mathematical Puzzle           Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email           January 8, 2014 8:27 AM ET            Robert Krulwich             A few years ago, physicist Brian Skinner  asked himself: What are the odds I will die in the next year? He was 25. What got him wondering about this, I have no idea, but, hey, it's something everybody asks. When I can't wedge my dental floss between my two front teeth, I ask it, too. So Brian looked up the answer — there are tables for this kind of thing — and what he discovered is interesting. Very interesting. Even mysterious.  Obviously, when you're young (and past the extra-risky years of early childhood), the chances of dying in the coming year are minuscule — roughly 1 in 3,000 for 25-year-olds. (This is a group average, of course.)           Robert Krulwich/NPR    But eight years later, the tables said, the odds will roughly double. As Brian writes in his blog post , "When I'm 33 [the chances of my dying that year] will be about 1 in 1,500."           Robert Kruwwich/NPR    And eight years after that, he says, the odds double again: "It will be about 1 in 750."           Robert Krulwich/NPR    And eight years later, there's another doubling. Looking down the chart, you'll see that keeps happening and happening and happening. "Your probability of dying during a given year," Brian writes, "doubles every eight years." Hmmm. When I looked at the latest tables (Brian's came from 2005), he's more or less right. Which got me wondering ...           Robert Krulwich /NPR    Why eight? Why the doubles?     This wasn't Brian's discovery. A British actuary, Benjamin Gompertz , noticed this pattern back in 1825, and ever since it's been called the Gompertz law of human mortality — yes, death creeps closer, but it creeps closer in orderly steps (for humans about every eight years).           Robert Krulwich/NPR    Doubling of this sort, when plotted on a chart, looks scary in the later years, but every interval early in the curve is also a doubling. So the same thing keeps happening, only the effects become more pronounced. Anyone reaching the age of 100 seems to have a 1 in 2 chance of getting to 101.  Looking at his pattern, Brian writes, "I can say with 99.999999 percent certainty that no human will ever live to the age of 130." (That's assuming, which one shouldn't, that we have no new, heroic medical advances.)  OK, so this happens. The pattern, says Brian, "holds across a large number of countries, time periods and even different species. While actual average lifespan changes quite a bit from country to country and from animal to animal, the same general rule that 'your probability of dying doubles every X years' holds true."  But here's the dangling question: Why the regular interval? Why eight years for humans?           Robert Krulwich /NPR    Brian's answer: "It's an amazing fact, and no one understands why it's true."  Really? Shouldn't there be some obvious explanation?  It's pretty obvious that when surveying a large population, death is not really a random, sudden bolt of lightning out of the blue. If it were, as Brian points out, the bolt would hit randomly, and in any collection of people ...           Robert Krulwich/NPR    ... the babies would be as likely to die as the oldsters, youngsters, middle-agers. But that's not how it works. Older people die more frequently than younger people (in peacetime, anyway).  So — random, death isn't.  Couldn't the latest biological explanations for aging explain an eight-year doubling pattern? Brian considers this question in his essay. He calls it the "cops and criminals theory." (It's based on a short paper by Boris Shklovskii .) As Brian describes it:   Imagine that within your body is an ongoing battle between cops and criminals. And, in general, the cops are winning. They patrol randomly through your body, and when they happen to come across a criminal, he is promptly removed. The cops can always defeat a criminal they come across, unless the criminal has been allowed to sit in the same spot for a long time. A criminal that remains in one place for long enough (say, one day) can build a 'fortress' which is too strong to be assailed by the police. If this happens, you die.             Robert Krulwich/NPR        Lucky for you, the cops are plentiful, and on average they pass by every spot 14 times a day. ... But what happens if your internal police force starts to dwindle? Suppose that as you age the police force suffers a slight reduction, so that they can only cover every spot 12 times a day? ... The difference between 14 and 12 doesn't seem like a big deal, but the result was that your chance of dying during a given day jumped by more than seven times. And if the strength of your police force drops linearly in time, your mortality rate will rise exponentially.  This is the Gompertz law, in cartoon form: Your body is deteriorating over time at a particular rate. When its 'internal policemen' are good enough to patrol every spot that might contain a criminal 14 times a day, then you have the body of a 25-year-old, and a 0.03 percent chance of dying this year. But by the time your police force can only patrol every spot seven times per day, you have the body of a 95-year-old with only a 2 in 3 chance of making it through the year.   This sounds right, that our immune system deteriorates at a steady pace, leaving us with fewer and fewer cops to remove the troublemakers in our bodies. As a metaphor, it works. But, says Brian, "unfortunately, the full complexity of human biology does not lend itself readily to cartoons about cops and criminals." There is no biological finding that explains the eight-year pattern we find in the mortality tables. The idea is nice. But the math? It has no obvious logic, no explanation — not yet. We know death is approaching, but why does it like the number eight?

We already know several risk factors that have a substantial impact on mortality. For example, smoking, lack of exercise and increased body mass index have been shown to increase the risk of dying earlier. Most previous studies have investigated one risk factor at a time – and usually in a limited number of individuals. However, in the first study of its kind, published in The Lancet , we compared many potential risk factors in a large number of individuals and come up with a tool that can be used by anyone living in the UK and aged between 40 and 70 to calculate their risk of dying within the next five years. In addition users can work out their “Ubble age” – a single prediction score that uses information about you to match your risk profile to the age of the average person of your gender in the UK. You can calculate your five-year risk of dying as well as your Ubble age using our interactive website , developed in collaboration with Sense About Science . After filling in a dozen or so simple questions, the tool is able to calculate your risk and your Ubble age. Coming up with the tool We examined and compared more than 655 measurements of demographics, health, and lifestyle factors in around 500,000 people from the UK Biobank who were aged between 40 and 70 years old. We then used a statistical survival model to work out the probability of these measurements predicting death from any cause, and also six specific causes, for men and women. Advertisement We analysed how well each measurement predicted mortality using something called the C-index. The higher the C-index, the more accurate the measurement is in discriminating between those who will die and those who won’t in the next five years. A C-index of 50-60% is considered a poor predictor, 60-70% moderate, 70-80% good, 80-90% very good and over 90% is considered excellent. We further selected the most predictive measurements, 13 for men and 11 for women, and combined them into the prediction score. For example we selected questions such as: “Do you smoke now?” or “In general how would you rate your overall health?”. The prediction score is also used to calculate the Ubble age, which is simply the age of an average individual from the UK of same gender that matches the predicted risk. So for example, if you’re a 53-year-old woman and your estimated risk of dying in five years is 2.4%, the most similar risk in the UK life tables is of a 56-year-old woman. So your Ubble age would be 56. A simple questionnaire We found that the variables that most accurately predicted death from all causes within five years did not need to be measured by physical examination, but could be reported by individuals through a questionnaire. Advertisement For example, asking people to rate their overall health (self-reported health) and to describe their usual walking pace were two of the strongest predictors in both men and women for different causes of death. It turns out that walking pace is more predictive of five-year mortality (a C-index of 72%) than body mass index (C-index of 68%). We also found that among individuals who did not have any known major disease, measurements of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality within five years. Overall, our study allows comparison of a large number of predictors of overall and cause-specific mortality in a way that has never been done before. As well as being open to use by people to improve their health awareness, health professionals and organisations can also use it to identify individuals at high-risk. Advertisement Limitations Our website was evaluated by several audit groups, including scientists and representatives from patient organisations and other stakeholders as well as individuals from the general public. However, there are some limitations in our study. The UK Biobank participants are not representative of the entire UK population, as they are more affluent and have lower mortality. We addressed this partly by recalibration of the prediction score using data from the UK census. We also only looked at the risk of dying within five years, and it is unknown how the prediction would look like beyond this period. Advertisement Finally, the tool is a predictor and cannot claim causality. Most of the strongest predictors of mortality are correlated, not proven as causally related. For example, a slow walking pace is a strong predictor of dying, but walking faster won’t necessarily lead to a reduced risk of dying. Smoking and dying, however, is one of the few things that we know are causally related. Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.

From: Best Health Care Degrees      Your Chances of Dying  The National Center for Health Statistics reports the average life expectancy in the
United States is 77.9 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
the leading causes of death in the United States are (in descending order) heart disease,
cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, Alzheimer's disease and
diabetes. (ref: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm ) There are so many ways to die early; from risky outdoor activities to smoking.  At Best Health Degrees we decided to take a look at just how much you increase your chances of dying through these activities.  Life after all is one big series of risks.  And some risks are worth the shot. One study
shows people have a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying while attending a dance party. Another
study shows the odds of dying while skydiving in the United States is 1 in 101,083

years from now according to British actuary Benjamin Gompertz in 1825; it's called
the "Gompertz Law of human mortality." Your probability of dying during a given year
doubles every 8 years.

(Image courtesy of Flickr user Brimstone , under a Creative Commons license)   It happened to actress Ingrid Bergman, women's rights activist Betty Friedan, and — tradition has it — William Shakespeare. They all died on their birthdays, and new research finds the typically joyous day turns out to be more tragic than expected for some.  The average death rate on people's birthdays is 6.7 percent higher than what you'd otherwise normally expect on that day, according to a new analysis from University of Chicago economics researcher Pablo Pena. The rate is even higher for young people and on weekends, he finds.  Pena analyzed Social Security Administration records for 25 million people who died between 1998 and 2011. Births and deaths don't happen evenly across the year, so Pena's analysis controls for seasonal patterns by comparing birthday death rates to what would be expected on a given day.  The Social Security records themselves don't provide information on the cause of deaths or characteristics of the departed. But some patterns do emerge.  For instance, young people between 20-29 years old have an excess death rate of 25.4 percent —perhaps a sign of birthday celebrations gone wrong. Excess death rates are slightly higher for birthdays falling on weekends across all age groups, Pena's the analysis finds, while the excess death rate for 20-29 year olds almost doubles to 48.3 percent.   The study isn't the first to cast a sad shadow on birthday celebrations. A 2012 study in the journal Annals of Epidemiology found a much higher probability (about 14 percent) that people over 60 will die on their birthdays. That study , which analyzed more than 2 million deaths, found that strokes and heart attacks rose 18.6 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, on birthdays. Tragically, the study also found a 34.9 percent increase in suicides and a 44 increase in deaths from falls.  Pena, whose results will be published in the February 2015 issue of Social Science & Medicine, writes that his study sample is about 10 times larger than the 2012 study. He says further research is needed into what's behind the link between birthdays and deaths, such as the causes and the socioeconomic factors, to drive a potential policy response to prevent these deaths.  "In principle, those policies could be as simple as campaigns to increase awareness of the risks associated with changes in behaviors on or around birthdays," he writes.  In other words, celebrate responsibly.                     Jason Millman covers all things health policy, with a focus on Obamacare implementation. He previously covered health policy for Politico.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8.

Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.   Editor's Note : This story was first published in 2005 and has been updated with the most recent data. Live Science will continue to update the odds of dying as new numbers are released.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.   Editor's Note : This story was first published in 2005 and has been updated with the most recent data. Live Science will continue to update the odds of dying as new numbers are released.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers.

About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.

The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively.

A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason?

Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8.

Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration.

Noah Davis calculates the odds of his demise on an ordinary day in New York City. Author: Noah Davis Publish date: Nov 21, 2013 Social count: 0 0 SHARES (PHOTO: DARKGEOMETRYSTUDIOS/ SHUTTERSTOCK ) Late last week, I found myself reading an article in The New York Times detailing one artist-turned-activist&apos;s plan to give Swiss citizens a monthly check for being alive. Cut to Monday morning, and I find out that the world will end on February 22, courtesy of the Norse god Odin&apos;s death at the hands of Fenrir the wolf. (Or something along those lines. Perhaps not coincidentally, the 30th Jorvik Viking Festival is also scheduled for the 22nd. So I don&apos;t know, mark your calendars?) Advertisement THANKS FOR WATCHING! VISIT WEBSITE Because my brain works in strange ways and/or because I spend most of my days sitting at home, staring out at the window trying to think about things to write, these two stories got me wondering when I was going to die. The Internet will give you a wide variety of answers. Death-clock.org said I had until Tuesday, November 30, 2060. DeathTimer.com chopped off 11 years—November 12, 2049, specifically—and listed my cause of death as a fight with Chuck Norris. If I get killed by a 109-year-old Chuck Norris, so be it. Also: Screw you, DeathTimer.com. A site affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania&apos;s Wharton School of Business had a remarkably complex survey and ultimately decided that I would meet my doom on August 2, 2063. TheDeathClock.com came with a malware warning. Since my untimely demise is what was being considered, not that of my already failing MacBook, I closed that tab. Advertisement THANKS FOR WATCHING! VISIT WEBSITE Advertisement THANKS FOR WATCHING! VISIT WEBSITE That was a fun exercise but so abstract. The better question, or at least the more relevant one to me, right now in this moment, is what are the chances that I&apos;m going to die today? I don&apos;t live a particularly dangerous life, but nearly everything we do has inherent risks, right? Could today be the day? Let&apos;s try to find out. (If you&apos;d like more, there&apos;s a book about such matters and Pacific Standard interviewed one of the writers over the summer.) These two stories got me wondering when I was going to die. FIRST, SOME OF THE obvious risks. I have to take the subway to Harlem later tonight. In 2012, 55 people died on the tracks (up from eight in 2011), but there were 1,654,582,265 total riders. That’s about one death for every 30 million riders and about one death per week. I might take a taxi back from Harlem. Seventy-three people lost their lives in traffic accidents in New York City in 2012, which, while tragic, is a low number considering there are more than 27 million taxi rides alone in a single year. That doesn&apos;t include the number of regular cars, livery cabs, buses, etc. Odds of dying in a traffic fatality today are well into the millions to one. It&apos;s actually considerably more dangerous to walk, as 148 pedestrians died in 2012, but that is still extremely unlikely. Biking would be another risk, with 18 cyclists dying in 2012, but biking is actually getting safer as awareness grows. There&apos;s always the chance, albeit a vanishingly small one, that I could fall into the Gowanus Canal while riding my bike over one of the bridges. While no one is exactly sure what would happen if I drank some of the water and while it wouldn&apos;t be a good thing for my health, it probably wouldn&apos;t kill me. So that&apos;s not a worry. That third arm I grow, however.... I might get a call from an editor about a story and need to get on a plane immediately. (Hey anonymous editors, are you reading?) The annual risk of being killed in a plane crash is about one in 11 million, but that generalizes over the entire population. A NOVA investigation pegged the figure for someone like me who flies fairly frequently—at around one in two million. But that&apos;s yearly, not daily, so the chance that today would be the day is obviously smaller. Speaking of unlikely, I spent Saturday at Princeton where there&apos;s a meningitis outbreak . Bloomberg informs me that 10 percent of the student body is carrying the bacteria but only one in 1,000 are getting sick. Still, up to 10 percent of people with symptoms die within 48 hours. I haven&apos;t started coughing yet, so I figure I&apos;m clear at least until Wednesday. I&apos;m playing squash this evening, and there&apos;s always the chance of a sudden cardiac incident. They are rare in 31-year-olds, and I haven&apos;t shown any warning signs, but these things come out of nowhere. I couldn&apos;t find any odds, but one group estimated that 10.1 in every one million participants would suffer a sports-related death. It&apos;s about lunchtime now—I want to be properly fed for my game this evening—and in recent months, I&apos;ve choked a few separate times because I eat too quickly and I am a moron. Odds of dying in a given year from choking on food are one in 370,035. Multiple that by 365 and I have a roughly one in 135 million chance of dying today from choking on food. But, again, I&apos;m kind of dumb that way and have a history of choking, so let&apos;s bump it up to one in 100 million. Still not likely. I could continue for quite some time while trying to determine the ways I&apos;ll die today but spending too much time on the Internet is bad for my health. There are always more things that are causes for concern , unseen forces that could send me flying off this mortal coil. But, thankfully, my impending doom doesn&apos;t seem too likely. In other words, I will probably live to see another day. Bring it on Walker, Texas Ranger.

S. Army, Infantry, Drill Sergeant, NCOIC Ft Lee Ops & Trg · Author has 376 answers and 2m answer views Whether or not you get deployed into a war-zone plays a large role in probability of death. I'm assuming you indeed are interested in probability of death in a war-zone. Let me use the Iraq War as a case study. Let me start with this: as a whole, you are 2.5 times more likely to die as a US military member than as a healthy, young civilian in the United States (Preston and Buzzel, 2007). Let's break this down further. There are many factors that contribute to risk of death. According to a study conducted by Preston and Buzzel in 2007, the following factors significantly affect risk of death: (1) branch of service, (2) component of service, (3) rank, and (4) age and sex. I will break down each of these four factors in the following paragraphs. 1. Branch of Service . Branch of service is broken down into Army, Marines, Air Force, and Navy (the Coast Guard was not included in this study). If you are a Marine, you are 2 times more likely to die compared to the Army, 10 times more likely to die when compared to the Navy, and 20 times more likely to die when compared to the Air Force. In fact, if you are in the Navy or Air Force, you have a much lower death rate than a healthy, young civilian in the United States. 2. Component of Service. This pertains to whether or not you are in Active Duty, Reserves, or National Guard. Death rates for Active Duty Army soldiers are 3 times more than Reserve Army soldiers. Army National Guard has an intermediate risk of death. Marines have a high risk of death regardless of component. 3. Rank. Enlisted men have 40% higher mortality rates than Officers. There are exceptions to this though. Army Lieutenants have a 19% higher mortality rate compared to all Army troops combined. Marine Lieutenants have a 11% higher mortality rate compared to all Marines. 4. Age and Sex. Younger military personnel have a higher chance of dying. Males are 5.5 times more likely at risk of dying compared to females. It's interesting to note that Marines are disproportionately young. 64.7% of Marines deployed to Iraq were aged 24 and younger, compared to the Army's 39.5% To sum everything up, if you're young, male, a Marine, and enlisted, you have the highest chance of dying. If you're a young male in the Army or Army National Guard, you have a moderate chance of dying. If you're in the Air Force or Navy, you have a low chance of dying. If you are female, you have a lower chance of dying. I hope this answer paints a clear picture for you. 317.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question Quora User Answered May 20, 2015 · Author has 191 answers and 112.4k answer views I think that it's more dependent on who you're at war with than what branch you're in. I mean, on the surface you would think that infantry, marines, they would get mowed down.  And generally they do, not the supply clerks and nurses, but grunts that didn't do to great on the asvab. Then, what about these modern wars where you're fighting among these lands that have been redirected to go through another pre-industrial age?  If you're in the Navy and not a bomber pilot, you're probably not going to get killed.  It's the twenty year old running around the depleted uranium-saturated streets that's going to get it. So, what if it's not war with the peasants?  In the World Wars whole ships filled with people in the Navy were killed at once.  The United States built Liberty Ships, shitty, low-quality, high-volume pigs that planners assume would be sunk in vast quantities.  There were no illusions. In fact, I've read that if you were in one of the countries involved in the European theater, it wasn't a bad idea to be in the ground forces because there all the civilians were getting vaporized, blown to bits, and incinerated too. Of course, if we went to war with Russia then a majority of officers flying an F-22 would not come back.  All of them flying a JSF-35 (is it in service?) would be dead.  Possibly all the Air Force guys at bases where they're launching F-22's would be bombed and strafed after all the F-22's had been blown out of the sky.  Maybe the infantry guys would get together with the Russian guys and watch the mess play out above.  "How long did yours go to college?  Ours are there for four years." And the Navy at war with Russia... everyone on those aircraft carriers would be a bit more nervous than when it's the peasant opposing force. So: Peasant enemy, combat MOS infantry and Marines.  Second world enemy, Navy sailors and officers alike and Air Force officers. Disclaimer: I know, we're not really fighting peasants.  We're just weaving in and out of peasants where the bad guys are hiding, dressed as peasants.  I mean no offense by pointing out the difference between a peasant army and a big army that is wearing matching costumes. 21.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

According to the latest statistics I could find: In 2009, there were 1,519 active duty deaths.  The highest percentage of those deaths were due to accidents, 28.5 per 100,000.  They do not differentiate between alcohol related accidents and normal accidents.  21.5/100,000 were due to hostile actions. There were about 1.6 million active duty members that year. For comparison, an average of 1,825 college students die each year from only alcohol related incidents alone.

Allen Inks , former Electrician's Mate First Class - EM1 (SS) at United States Navy (1972-1980) Answered Jul 13, 2016 · Author has 1.4k answers and 1.5m answer views Originally Answered: If war broke out in the US, which Branch of the military would you be more likely to survive in? EDIT: The question changed; it originally was asking about survival chances in various military branches if “war broke out in the US”. I’ve not got enough time to change the answer to fit the new question. Okay, “War broke out in the US” is kind of vague. Do you mean A) civil war , for example, another civil war between Republicans and Democrats? Do you mean B) war with a foreign power inside the US, as in Canada and Mexico go in cahoots to attack and invade the US? Or do you mean C) nuclear war, as in one of the Kims fulfills the dynasty’s self-destructive tendencies, and launches several nuclear missiles at the US, which in turn, turns that failing country into a nice pristine glass parking lot for KIA and Hyundai factory overflow - which in turns results in some further nuclear missile strikes against the US from another country…who shall remain nameless? Note that I am assuming that option A is non-nuclear - though sometimes from the rhetoric from the far right and the far left, I’m not sure. I wish everyone would just wise up, vote Libertarian, and leave the Democratic and Republican parties on the ash heaps of history, but … I digress. A) In the case of a civil war, I will assume that the main purpose of the Republican and Democratic Navies will be to blockade the coasts of the land held by the other side, and to break the Naval blockades of the other side. I expect that the naval nuclear weapon assets controlled by each side will be sent to far-flung bases to wait out the war, and that we will be smart enough (or at least military leaders will be… I can’t vouch for ANY of the politicians) to not target things like nuclear weapons storage facilities, Minuteman missile silos, or nuclear power plants. The Air Force, Army and Marines will likely be highly involved. Likewise, Coast Guard highly involved doing blockade work (but lacking subs or significant anti-submarine capability, will mostly be targets for submarines). Best bet for survival: Navy. B) In the case of invasion by the frozen Canadians and the highly motivated Mexicans (NOTE TONGUE FIRMLY IN CHEEK - this is hypothetical and I’m just teasing our friends across the borders - actually, I know of at least 4 Canadians who are partially defrosted.) Again, I would expect the Army and Marines to be highly involved in repulsing those dastardly foes from our hallowed soil. Lots of bullets flying on all three sides… The Air Force should be flying tactical support for our ground troops… but by this time will probably have retired the A-10 (not sexy enough a mission for the Generals), so they will be flying F-35s and F-22’s to gain air superiority, and finding out that the F-35 makes a shitty replacement for an A-10. Hopefully, the Marines will have plenty of their planned V-22 Osprey gunship variants to augment Army helicopter crews to support the ground pounders. The Air Force will also be using B-52s that are on Medicare and collecting Social Security to support the troops using smart bombs, and using B2’s to bomb Ottawa, Mexico City, and other strategic location… but sparing important cultural sites like Senor Frog’s in Los Cabos. The Coast Guard….guarding the coasts to prevent opening a third or fourth front…likely, not too too involved. Maybe some riverine warfare. Navy…. using aircraft carriers to assist our North American Free Trade partners that they really want to go back home, or there won’t be a home to go back to. Best bet for survival: Coast Guard… followed by Navy. C) Multiple Exchange Massive Nuclear war: Substantially everybody dies. Best bet for being amongst the last to die: Submarine crew (Navy) or Minute Man Missile launch officers (Air Force). My best guess would be the Navy would be the last to go… more mobility to avoid fallout (authority for this “guess” - “On the Beach” (book or movie)). My advice re nuclear weapons sounds just like Nancy Reagan’s advice on drugs, “Just Say No”. Funny coming from a guy who spent 4 years living amongst 16 thermonuclear tipped SLBMs, doing his part to make sure my sub was ready when the call came, right? Nope… not funny. 27.9k Views · View Upvoters   Riccardo P , studied at University of Zurich Answered May 25, 2017 Eric Tang answered this question and got a lot of upvotes.

Eric, I really have nothing personally against you or anyone else that wrote something similar here, but honestly, this is one of the most misleading statements I ever heard/read. Please STOP fooling young people with this kind of statements. It highly suggest to enroll in Military because you may apparently live longer! But this is very obviously big b#$@=%÷! To enroll in Military means (1.) to become a killer and (2.) to be exposed to a much higher probability to die young if you are sent to a war zone. How much higher the probability is, is less important in my opinion. But it certainly is higher if you “play around” with arms. I mean, even the government tells you not to travel in war zones . Why? Because it is dangerous. You could die. Higher risk to die. I would really not trust any statistics that suggest that the probability to die is lower if you enroll yourself in Military. 1.9k Views · View Upvoters   Gary Leverich , worked at U.S. Marine Corps Answered May 15, 2015 · Upvoted by Quora User , Hobby Farmer, Amateur Brewer, Retired US Army Cavalry Scout · Author has 472 answers and 2.9m answer views Combat is of course risky.  But most of the military never sees actual combat, they serve in support roles.  Even support roles carry their own level of risk.  Advanced weaponry is designed to take out support functions.  So working on an airfield well away from actual combat still carries a level of risk.  Other than combat, the highest cause of death in the military (all branches) is alcohol.  I was stationed with the 101st Airborne Division.  That division has a sign at the front of the base (at least used to) counting the days since the last alcohol related traffic death.  If we made it 101 days, we would get a day off.  We rarely made it 101 days. In 15 years of service, including 6 years in the Marine Corps with 2 combat deployments, and 9 in the Army with one peacekeeping mission, I lost 1 soldier.  That's because he wrapped his car around a tree after a weekend binge. 44.9k Views · View Upvoters   Daniel Kearns , former Paratrooper 82nd Airborne at U.S. Army Answered Mar 25, 2013 · Author has 1k answers and 4.8m answer views Generally, it matters not which branch you pick. What matters is what job you pick in that branch. Known as an MOS (Military Occupation Specialty), some are much more dangerous than others. For example, 11B Infantry is an MOS in the US Army that would be considered much more dangerous than say 36B Financial Management Technician.  There would be very few, (read: no), instances where a 36B might see combat. In todays US Army, virtually every Regular Army 11B will see some variation of combat at some point. Every US Military Branch has jobs known as Combat Arms.  These jobs will always be more dangerous than Support jobs. 36k Views · View Upvoters   Clell Harmon , Retired USN.

Take poorly maintained cars, an idiot behind the wheel looking to impress his passengers, lubricate with a bit of alcohol and you get dead people. I was in the Navy for more than 20 years. In my time in service, I buried five of my shipmates because of auto accidents.  None to combat, one to catestrophic equipment failure on a Submarine, two to drowning (one 'on duty' and one from being stupidly drunk and finding a rip current), and one to an undiagnosed aneurysm that burst when we were underway. 22.5k Views · View Upvoters   Rachel Bolyard , World traveler, appreciator of well built things Answered May 5, 2017 · Author has 260 answers and 199.2k answer views Your chances of dying in an auto accident are like 2000x higher than dying in any modern combat scenario. You're literally safer in a war zone than driving yourself out for dinner tonight. 30k people die per year in the US driving and 14 soldiers died in combat in 2016. Most jobs in the military, even if you're in a combat zone, don't involve shooting. You may end up with some convoy duty, which is by far the most risky thing to do, because a) it's driving and military vehicles are top heavy, rolling over and killing their operators routinely in training or combat, and b) convoys are symbols of power and occupation therefore insurgents like to target them. Training fatalities in the armed forces are in the hundreds per year per force. The Navy is probably the most dangerous because they have the most machinery and moving parts.

The Coast Guard operates under the U.S Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, but can be transferred to the U.S Department of the Navy by Congress or the President. But it is technically part of the military. The Coast Guard would probably be your best bet. In World War II, 241,093 people served in the Coast Guard. Out of the 241,093 people that served, 574 died in action. That’s literally a 0.2% death rate, almost non-existent.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Infantry  U.S. Army  Military What are the chances of me dying by joining the army infantry in the current war climate? I’m considering the 3 year contract. Update Cancel Answer Wiki 9 Answers   Victor Egorov , former Fort G Meade at U.S. Army Answered Oct 24, 2017 · Upvoted by Quora User , former Supervisor S2 at Armies and  MIke Gentile , former Veteran  at U.S. Army (1988-1992) · Author has 596 answers and 807.4k answer views Your chances of becoming a casualty are quite low. I would not agree with with some of the other answers here and claims that “you have a higher chance to die in car crash” - this simply is not true. -So 3 year contract. -Infantry -Situation similar to last decade and a half of Iraq/Afghanistan proportions, in short an insurgency war. Off the bat, in three year congract you should only have enough time to train, get to your unit, deploy one time( 12 months) I’m using approximate numbers as I recall these to be during my time in the service. please find it within yourself to not argue or correct me on every number I chose to use for this approximation. For a war time statistic of active combat action and hostility we could take a situation that I recall being off and on a norm 2005 -2012. So among a force of 100,000 US military Service members deployed 50 are KIA a month. Some months have been better some have been worse. A low 20/30-for a slow month, while on a bad month 100+ ) In addition each month could have 100 more experience loss of limb, severe burns, loss of cognitive function/brain damage, spinal cord injury, complete loss of eye sight… life changing injuries. Plus another 200 service members are wounded to various lesser degrees. These injuries and deaths mainly distributed among combat arms soldiers. Infantry, light mechonised, MPs, combat engineers( route clearance) EOD, JSOC units. Realistically about 30,000- 40,000 out of total troop strength would sponge up most of the casualties and injuries. Let’s say 2/3s of it. So out of 100,000 with focus on 30,000 that have spent a year in combat zone as combat arms soldiers during war time mission 50*(2/3)*12 = 400 would be KIAs 100*(2/3)*12 =800 gravely injured 200*(2/3)*12=1600 non life changing injury( gunshot, concussion, loss of fingers,partial eyesight) While the other 1/3 of deaths and injuries will distribute among cooks, supply, air assets, medics, admin, engineers, mechanics, and on. So, just to ballpark on a single 3 year contract with a 12 month deployment into an active combat zone as we have witnessed over last decade and a half: You have about 1- 1,2% chance of loosing your life. 2–3% chance of being gravely injured. 4–7% of being wounded. So it’s a little above national highway injury statistic but it’s not terribly bad either. All and all your chances of getting “fucked up bad” are below 5% Getting “Hurt” are below 7% On back end, I’d recommend looking up monthly stats for suicides among US combat veterans… it’s somewhat high and troubling. 4.8k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by TruthFinder Have you ever googled yourself?

The probability compared to branches such as the Marines, or the Army are for obvious reasons much lower considered the Air Force is not a “Boots on the ground” oriented branch. However, the chance will ALWAYS be there, because of the nature of the beast. People die from car crashes, freak accidents, the Air Force is not removed from those things. In my career field (Security Forces/Military Police) over a couple of decades we’ve had maybe 12 ish deaths, but if you were to decide to be a Battlefield Airman (PJ, TACP, CCT) you WOULD be the boots on the ground for the Air Force.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Tokyo  Japan  Death and Dying What is the chance of you dying or being seriously wounded by an earthquake by living in Tokyo? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers   Carlo La Porta , 25 years in Tokyo, 2 years is in Osaka, Fluent Japanese Answered Apr 7, 2016 All things being relative I would say your chances of dying are low, depending on how you interpret the figures. "seriously wounded" is kind of hard to define and I did not have that data at hand. So below text is focused on "chances of dying" only. Around 6000 people died in the Hanshin earthquake in 1995. The population there at the time was around 20 million people, so the chances were about 1 in 3,300. If you look at it from the Kobe perspective, which is a "small" part of the Hanshin area where the epicenter was, about 4000 people died in a population of 1.5 million so the chances then were be about 1 in 375, which considering the fact it was the epicenter is very low in my opinion. Depending on how you define Tokyo (ie just the actual city) or as the area of Kanto (ie the region of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama) numbers will look a little different. Kanto has a population of about 42 million people which has a population density of 1300 people/km2   against Hanshin which as 830/km, so about 1.5 times denser. Based on just this, the chances could then be about 1 in 2, 200 for the Kanto region. Tokyo (the city)'s density is 6,200/km2 against Kobe's circa 2,750/km2, ie circa 2.3 times, so looking at Tokyo one could extrapolate your chances to be about 1 in 170? Having said that there were a number of drastic changes to building regulations across the country after 1995 and a number of issues that caused deaths have been remedied. For example all of the supporting pillars of the highways have been strengthened. Crashed pieces of highways were both direct and indirect cause of death (ambulances and firefighters unable to get to where they needed to) is just one example, so this could mitigate the difference in density. Also the percentage of concrete buildings is higher in Tokyo than it was in Kobe, so fire risks are lesser I think. All in all, I personally feel as safe in Tokyo as I would in any other city if not more. The risk of the earthquake happening where I am and of me dying as a result of that are at least comparable if not lower than to being in a car crash or being shot in other cities ... I hope this helps. 304 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below Is everybody in Tokyo going to die? Why does Tokyo have so many earthquakes?

Ask New Question   Tony Smyth , Author: Fukushima and the Coming Tokyo Earthquake (2011-present) Updated Nov 30, 2017 · Author has 739 answers and 287.8k answer views The last time there was big quake in Tokyo was 1923 (lets ignore 2011 – that was a 5.8 in Tokyo, very scary but not a MAJOR quake, at least not in Tokyo). [ The 1923 earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Tōkyō and four-fifths of Yokohama. At that time, the Tōkyō Metropolitan Area had a population of some 4.4 million, and Yokohama half a million. 142,800 people died. Nearly half of the houses in the two cities were partially or fully destroyed. Property damage came to 2% of Japan's total national wealth. The present-day Greater Tōkyō Area has a population of 35.5 million and a population density of 2,640 persons per square kilometre, easily the most densely populated metropolis in the world. There are far fewer areas of escape now than in the 1920s ]. [One of the scenarios being considered by Japanese seismologists is a quake with its epicentre at the head of Tōkyō Bay. If this was to happen, and the quake was a Richter scale magnitude 7 or greater, short tremor cycles (the most destructive type) would strike below the focal point of Japanese leadership, with very little loss of intensity. In this worst-case scenario, a Richter scale magnitude 9 quake, an estimated 11,000 people would be killed and some 850,000 buildings would collapse or burn down. In 2013, a central government panel forecast that 175,000 older wooden buildings will be destroyed in a magnitude 7 earthquake. Another recent Japanese government report estimated that 58,000 people will be trapped in collapsed structures and that, in major business areas, 11,000 will find themselves stuck in elevators. As many as 2,000 fires will break out simultaneously. Though some may be extinguished by communal efforts, the majority will be beyond the ability of survivors to douse, even if water supplies remain functioning. Up to 410,000 buildings are predicted to be destroyed as fires burn out of control for days]. Oil Refinery in Chiba Prefecture, north of Tokyo in March 2011. It took 10 days to put out the blaze. 24% of Japans GDP comes from two huge industrial zones along both sides of Tokyo Bay, much of it built on reclaimed land. [For many who live and work in the centre of Tōkyō there are few safe areas of escape. Each day, some 3.64 million commuters pass through Shinjuku Station, by a long way the busiest train station in the world, its passages all underground. The wards of central Tōkyō have extremely high population densities, swelling from 13 million to some 16 million during working hours. In 21st-century Tōkyō, the schoolyards and parks designated as special evacuation areas are small. Although the city has 6,000 parks, many are tiny. Tōkyō has the least amount of greenery and park area per head of population of any world city. Moreover, the SEAs are not distributed evenly. The industrial area of Kawasaki that lies between Tōkyō and Yokohama has very little open space, apart from that around one soccer stadium]. Usually a big quake - MAG 6, 7 or over hits Tokyo/Yokohama once every 60–70 years. There hasn’t been one since 1923 so it is long overdue. So to answer your question, the odds of being injured or of dying are much higher than in 1923 simply because there are far fewer areas of escape, and Tokyo/Yokohama is one dense entity- a Metropolis - right out to the mountains. It is far more densely populated than in 1923. How bad it will be will depend on wind velocity and the time of day. Most of those who died in 1923 died from the fires that broke out. 569 Views   Por Phoenix , lived in Tokyo Answered Apr 7, 2016 · Author has 764 answers and 227.8k answer views Unless the quake is so intense, like 7.0 up? I survived the 2011 earthquake. Tokyo then was measured at 5.0 it was still strong. The stairs were shaking, buildings were bending left and right like jelly, but amazingly nothing fell apart- except for advertising signs in front of buildings- like 7-11 and minimart signs. If you watch where you go / know where to take shelter / cover, should be fine. Only some elderly died that day i think. Tokyo is more prepared for earthquake more than you know it. I didn't even get any scratches. I am more concerned about having nothing to eat AFTER the quake. This photo was taken from a nearby mini mart where I tried to stock up some supplies. 486 Views · View Upvoters   Gareth Edwards , lives in Tokyo (1998-present) Answered Jul 15, 2017 The Japanese government’s simulation envisages 23,000 deaths and 610,000 buildings lost due to collapse or fire were a 7.3 magnitude earthquake to hit in the vicinity of Ota ward. These numbers have been criticized for trying to reassure, and failing to factor deaths resulting from (for example) power cuts/fires in underground stations into the numerical estimates. Other estimates (e.g., from the Tokyo metropolitan government) put the death toll lower (9,700) and envisage less property damage, but may be focused more narrowly. Very approximately, the range of estimates seems to be from around 10,000-30,000 dead and around 150,000 injured, out of a population of 13mn (so 13,000 deaths would be 0.1% of the population). Swing factors are going to come from things like weather, the age of the building stock in the particular area, the percentage of older wooden buildings (i.e., fire risk) and so forth. Despite Tokyo’s constant rebuilding, there are older areas with a high density of old wooden houses that could be a source of major fires. It’s also worth noting that several million people are going to have trouble getting home (even after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, train services in Tokyo were shut down and there were incredible traffic jams—resulting in huge crowds of people wrapped in space blankets trudging home). And unlike in the Tohoku earthquake, which caused minimal property damage in Tokyo, a direct hit on the capital could result in a couple of million people bedding down in school halls, gyms etc. Those things represent health risks. Finally, I’d point out that using a 5.0 earthquake as a yardstick for expectations of what would happen in a 7+ is a little dicey - the scale is logarithmic, and the amount of energy released in a 7.0 is 1,000 times that of a 5.0. Friends who survived the 6.9 in Hanshin [1] in 1995 talk about being bounced out of bed, thrown to the ground, and so forth. But in the normal way? You’ll occasionally jump because the earth rumbles at you a bit, and that’s it. For better or worse, earthquakes tend to fall into three categories, in order of frequency: ignorable (most), momentarily scary (occasional), and massive, fatality and recession-inducing monsters (very infrequent).

A Mathematical Puzzle : Krulwich Wonders...  What are the odds that you will die this year? Whatever they are, the mortality tables suggest those odds will double eight years from now. Death, apparently, moves closer at a curiously regular pace. Why this eight-year progression? Is it something biological? Random? What is it about eight that attracts the Grim Reaper? Let's ask.          Am I Going To Die This Year? A Mathematical Puzzle       Krulwich Wonders  Robert Krulwich On Science           Facebook         Am I Going To Die This Year? A Mathematical Puzzle           Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email           January 8, 2014 8:27 AM ET            Robert Krulwich             A few years ago, physicist Brian Skinner  asked himself: What are the odds I will die in the next year? He was 25. What got him wondering about this, I have no idea, but, hey, it's something everybody asks. When I can't wedge my dental floss between my two front teeth, I ask it, too. So Brian looked up the answer — there are tables for this kind of thing — and what he discovered is interesting. Very interesting. Even mysterious.  Obviously, when you're young (and past the extra-risky years of early childhood), the chances of dying in the coming year are minuscule — roughly 1 in 3,000 for 25-year-olds. (This is a group average, of course.)           Robert Krulwich/NPR    But eight years later, the tables said, the odds will roughly double. As Brian writes in his blog post , "When I'm 33 [the chances of my dying that year] will be about 1 in 1,500."           Robert Kruwwich/NPR    And eight years after that, he says, the odds double again: "It will be about 1 in 750."           Robert Krulwich/NPR    And eight years later, there's another doubling. Looking down the chart, you'll see that keeps happening and happening and happening. "Your probability of dying during a given year," Brian writes, "doubles every eight years." Hmmm. When I looked at the latest tables (Brian's came from 2005), he's more or less right. Which got me wondering ...           Robert Krulwich /NPR    Why eight? Why the doubles?     This wasn't Brian's discovery. A British actuary, Benjamin Gompertz , noticed this pattern back in 1825, and ever since it's been called the Gompertz law of human mortality — yes, death creeps closer, but it creeps closer in orderly steps (for humans about every eight years).           Robert Krulwich/NPR    Doubling of this sort, when plotted on a chart, looks scary in the later years, but every interval early in the curve is also a doubling. So the same thing keeps happening, only the effects become more pronounced. Anyone reaching the age of 100 seems to have a 1 in 2 chance of getting to 101.  Looking at his pattern, Brian writes, "I can say with 99.999999 percent certainty that no human will ever live to the age of 130." (That's assuming, which one shouldn't, that we have no new, heroic medical advances.)  OK, so this happens. The pattern, says Brian, "holds across a large number of countries, time periods and even different species. While actual average lifespan changes quite a bit from country to country and from animal to animal, the same general rule that 'your probability of dying doubles every X years' holds true."  But here's the dangling question: Why the regular interval? Why eight years for humans?           Robert Krulwich /NPR    Brian's answer: "It's an amazing fact, and no one understands why it's true."  Really? Shouldn't there be some obvious explanation?  It's pretty obvious that when surveying a large population, death is not really a random, sudden bolt of lightning out of the blue. If it were, as Brian points out, the bolt would hit randomly, and in any collection of people ...           Robert Krulwich/NPR    ... the babies would be as likely to die as the oldsters, youngsters, middle-agers. But that's not how it works. Older people die more frequently than younger people (in peacetime, anyway).  So — random, death isn't.  Couldn't the latest biological explanations for aging explain an eight-year doubling pattern? Brian considers this question in his essay. He calls it the "cops and criminals theory." (It's based on a short paper by Boris Shklovskii .) As Brian describes it:   Imagine that within your body is an ongoing battle between cops and criminals. And, in general, the cops are winning. They patrol randomly through your body, and when they happen to come across a criminal, he is promptly removed. The cops can always defeat a criminal they come across, unless the criminal has been allowed to sit in the same spot for a long time. A criminal that remains in one place for long enough (say, one day) can build a 'fortress' which is too strong to be assailed by the police. If this happens, you die.             Robert Krulwich/NPR        Lucky for you, the cops are plentiful, and on average they pass by every spot 14 times a day. ... But what happens if your internal police force starts to dwindle? Suppose that as you age the police force suffers a slight reduction, so that they can only cover every spot 12 times a day? ... The difference between 14 and 12 doesn't seem like a big deal, but the result was that your chance of dying during a given day jumped by more than seven times. And if the strength of your police force drops linearly in time, your mortality rate will rise exponentially.  This is the Gompertz law, in cartoon form: Your body is deteriorating over time at a particular rate. When its 'internal policemen' are good enough to patrol every spot that might contain a criminal 14 times a day, then you have the body of a 25-year-old, and a 0.03 percent chance of dying this year. But by the time your police force can only patrol every spot seven times per day, you have the body of a 95-year-old with only a 2 in 3 chance of making it through the year.   This sounds right, that our immune system deteriorates at a steady pace, leaving us with fewer and fewer cops to remove the troublemakers in our bodies. As a metaphor, it works. But, says Brian, "unfortunately, the full complexity of human biology does not lend itself readily to cartoons about cops and criminals." There is no biological finding that explains the eight-year pattern we find in the mortality tables. The idea is nice. But the math? It has no obvious logic, no explanation — not yet. We know death is approaching, but why does it like the number eight?

We already know several risk factors that have a substantial impact on mortality. For example, smoking, lack of exercise and increased body mass index have been shown to increase the risk of dying earlier. Most previous studies have investigated one risk factor at a time – and usually in a limited number of individuals. However, in the first study of its kind, published in The Lancet , we compared many potential risk factors in a large number of individuals and come up with a tool that can be used by anyone living in the UK and aged between 40 and 70 to calculate their risk of dying within the next five years. In addition users can work out their “Ubble age” – a single prediction score that uses information about you to match your risk profile to the age of the average person of your gender in the UK. You can calculate your five-year risk of dying as well as your Ubble age using our interactive website , developed in collaboration with Sense About Science . After filling in a dozen or so simple questions, the tool is able to calculate your risk and your Ubble age. Coming up with the tool We examined and compared more than 655 measurements of demographics, health, and lifestyle factors in around 500,000 people from the UK Biobank who were aged between 40 and 70 years old. We then used a statistical survival model to work out the probability of these measurements predicting death from any cause, and also six specific causes, for men and women. Advertisement We analysed how well each measurement predicted mortality using something called the C-index. The higher the C-index, the more accurate the measurement is in discriminating between those who will die and those who won’t in the next five years. A C-index of 50-60% is considered a poor predictor, 60-70% moderate, 70-80% good, 80-90% very good and over 90% is considered excellent. We further selected the most predictive measurements, 13 for men and 11 for women, and combined them into the prediction score. For example we selected questions such as: “Do you smoke now?” or “In general how would you rate your overall health?”. The prediction score is also used to calculate the Ubble age, which is simply the age of an average individual from the UK of same gender that matches the predicted risk. So for example, if you’re a 53-year-old woman and your estimated risk of dying in five years is 2.4%, the most similar risk in the UK life tables is of a 56-year-old woman. So your Ubble age would be 56. A simple questionnaire We found that the variables that most accurately predicted death from all causes within five years did not need to be measured by physical examination, but could be reported by individuals through a questionnaire. Advertisement For example, asking people to rate their overall health (self-reported health) and to describe their usual walking pace were two of the strongest predictors in both men and women for different causes of death. It turns out that walking pace is more predictive of five-year mortality (a C-index of 72%) than body mass index (C-index of 68%). We also found that among individuals who did not have any known major disease, measurements of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality within five years. Overall, our study allows comparison of a large number of predictors of overall and cause-specific mortality in a way that has never been done before. As well as being open to use by people to improve their health awareness, health professionals and organisations can also use it to identify individuals at high-risk. Advertisement Limitations Our website was evaluated by several audit groups, including scientists and representatives from patient organisations and other stakeholders as well as individuals from the general public. However, there are some limitations in our study. The UK Biobank participants are not representative of the entire UK population, as they are more affluent and have lower mortality. We addressed this partly by recalibration of the prediction score using data from the UK census. We also only looked at the risk of dying within five years, and it is unknown how the prediction would look like beyond this period. Advertisement Finally, the tool is a predictor and cannot claim causality. Most of the strongest predictors of mortality are correlated, not proven as causally related. For example, a slow walking pace is a strong predictor of dying, but walking faster won’t necessarily lead to a reduced risk of dying. Smoking and dying, however, is one of the few things that we know are causally related. Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.
