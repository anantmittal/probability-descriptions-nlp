I was wondering what are the chances of being told that the baby is a boy from a scan and finding out that it is actually a girl when the baby is born?  This pregnancy is completely different from my other two, and I was really hoping for a girl this time‚Ä¶. trying not to be disappointed‚Ä¶ I know I will love him no matter what.

LOL i think its easier for them to say its a girl and have the baby end up being a boy. but if they say its a boy it usually is              0          babybrookes   Posted March 20, 2016    0 Comments     aw i know i have 2 boys and im 13 weeks pregnant now and im really hoping for a girl, plus im like you my symptoms and pregnancy is so much different from my two boys, but with an ultrasound it sort of depends really if the babys in a good possition or not to give you a clear and precise answer on the sex the babys leg could have been in the possition and the ob thought a boy, but i dont really hear alot of the ultrasound genders be wrong but if you like you could always ask your ob to double check because you know that this is completly different than your previous babys she may do but i would still say 50/50 until you know for certain i hope this helped i would love another boy though they are very very cute and cudly with their mummys lol a little girl though is always nice to have though when u have lads xxxxxxxx              0          bethk   Posted March 20, 2016    0 Comments     There is a chance! My mum was told she was having a girl and turned out she had a boy! Another lady on her ward was told she was having a boy and had a girl instead! So luckily my mother and the other lady swapped the baby clothes rather than being lumbered with a load of clothes they couldnt use! So there is always a chance as the umbilical cord could be the winky thats been sighted! But usually it is a boy if they say boy x              0          JulieL   Posted March 20, 2016    0 Comments     i think its alot easier for them to mistake a girl for a boy then a boy for a girl. i had my us on tuesday and its a boy and there is no mistaking it.              0          MadysonsMommy   Posted March 20, 2016    0 Comments     Yep, usually once they say boy that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre getting. Those parts are pretty unmistakable. Like everyone else said, every now and then they‚Äôll say girl and it ends up being a boy but usually not the other way around. My two pregnancys have been IDENTICAL in every way shape and form so I was sure I was getting another girl but I‚Äôve got a boy this time. I think just because the pregnancy seems different doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre getting a different gender. But like you said, you will love him no matter what!!              0          6girlsplus1   Posted March 20, 2016    0 Comments     with how advanced U/S technology is now it is pretty uncommon to mistake a girl for a boy, expecially after 18 weeks.

My partner has his heart totally set on a boy and truthfully, so do I! Has anybody ever had their ultrasound be wrong when they were told it was a boy?

He helps couples to know their baby&#39;s gender without ultrasound just by looking at your photos. Hi is an administrator of the group at facebook. So find his group. This group is called Baby gender by parents photo           a BabyCenter member   Answered 7/31/16                81 found this helpful     For both my children the ultrasound tech told me it was a girl. I was very happy to hear that. Then I had people tell me there have been mistakes and I started thinking maybe they are right and went into panic mode. I was really annoyed that I had listened to other people because guess what I had two daughters. The Ultrasound tech was correct. Don't listen to people, just trust modern technology as well as the technician who see these everyday and enjoy the rest of your pregnancy!              Anonymous   Answered 8/30/07               57 found this helpful     My son is now 5 years old. We were told from 20-32 weeks that we were having our second girl. I knew better. Something in side me was saying that the Doc was wrong. At 33 weeks my baby had grown a penis. He was just shy and still is. I knew it, I almost fell off that table!                 Jessica0901    Answered 9/24/07               36 found this helpful     Unfortunately, as accurate as we would like technology to be, it isn't always so. If your tech got a really good look all 3 times then there is a good chance the guess about a boy is right. I did have an experience, however, when they were wrong. When I was pg with my daughter (now almost 16) I was told I was carrying a boy. The tech even circle the &quot;penis&quot; and typed in &quot;boy&quot; next to it. So, we prepared for a boy thinking that since they pointed &quot;it&quot; out it had to be true. Well, you can imagine our surprise in the delivery room when I gave birth to a girl! The &quot;penis&quot; was in fact the umbilical cord and the tech misread what she was seeing. If your baby's cord is out of the way and the tech is still saying boy, then I would say the guess is probably right!                 m00ndancer    Answered 9/24/07               27 found this helpful     There's a chance that it could be wrong, but it's very small, so you can relax. The chance is small enough that there is no need to stress out about it. With 3 ultrasounds that you've had, the chance of them being wrong is even smaller than normal. If you're worried, you could ask the ultrasound tech how sure they think they are of the gender. Sometimes, they don't get a really good look and can be wrong. But if he/she got a really good shot of your baby's &quot;parts&quot;, they are probably right.                 Bailey422    Answered 9/5/07               21 found this helpful     3 ultrasounds + they all say the same thing... there is nothing to fear. If it's bothering you so much you could always go to a 3D ultrasound place +/or post your ultrasound images on websites where people guess/tell you the gender. Google it. :)

Also, keep receipts for any strictly boy stuff you purchase just in case.                 mama_biscuit    Answered 9/6/07               21 found this helpful     I am 34 weeks pregnant. I had my heart set on having a boy. The ultrasound technician recently told us that we are having a girl. I just want to make sure. I strongly feel it&#39;s a boy, my husband too and his intuition is never wrong. What is the possibility of ultrasond technician was wrong?                 claudiaed    Answered 3/24/17               20 found this helpful     I am 34 weeks and have had two ultrasounds, and have also been told I am having a boy. I have 2 girls and just like you my husband and I have our hearts set on this boy. I have already given away all of my little girls clothes and purchased all new boy items. The pictures given to me looked pretty clear and I am pretty confident it is a boy. After 3 ultrasounds I would say you should be pretty confident also. Don't worry and congrats!!!                 LILAZ    Answered 9/24/07               19 found this helpful     It really depends on who is doing the ultrasound. My son was suppose to be a girl on all 3 of our u/s. The doctor did the ultrsound. The ultrasound specilist know what they are doing better.                 buchanan_johnson    Answered 9/3/07               15 found this helpful     I have had two ultrasounds and they weren't sure 100% on either of them the tech told me that if she had to guess she would guess a girl and the second tech had a real hard time because the baby had covered its parts for about 45 minutes and when it finally moved she said well nothing obviouse so its a girl.. I wish she would have just said I don't know. but we were seening her just for the sex and I feel like she just had to give us an answer. I feel like I am haveing a boy for some reason. Maybe because I really want one, I don't really know. But in your case I would say get a 3d or 4d if you just can't get past it. Good luck and congrats.                 shellhart    Answered 9/24/07               14 found this helpful           / 9                 Reason for reporting   Offensive or inappropriate materials  Spamming or advertising  Vulgarity or profanity  Personal attack  Invasion of privacy  Copyright infringement       Cancel    Submit       Thank you for your feedback.

Mine is going to make me wait until my 24th week so that they will have a much better chance of getting the sex correct.

My sister-in-law had her scan at 20 weeks and was told she was having a boy. Then, at her next ultrasound, they said oh now it's looking like a girl. And yup, Emily is definitely a beautiful 4 month old little girl now!  But look at this ultrasound... how did it look so clearly like a boy and how often does this happen??     --  1st Baby Due 8-22-2017  ‚ô°        See all comments from original poster (13)  Hide all comments from original poster (13)      Load more            Comment            Report this post        2          Comments (64)        / 7                   HistoriaMum    Posted 01/16/2017      Not sure on statistics but my DH  (dear husband) was "supposed" to be a girl üòÇ They had to leave to hospital and go get some non-dresses üòùüòÇ               Reply            Report this comment        5                     Jennalynn822 ¬∑ Original Poster    Posted 01/16/2017       HistoriaMum said:    Not sure on statistics but my DH was "supposed" to be a girl üòÇ They had ...

The answer is always yes and then I ask how long they have been doing it. That way I can subtley ask without being like, "How qualified are you?".

Mamakass87    Posted 01/21/2015       I went in for my 20 week scan yesterday, they let me do it 3 weeks early. Turns out I was earlier than they thought, only 15 weeks. They still did the scan and told me with almost 100% certainty I'm having a boy. I already have two boys and I am devastated. Any chance they could be wrong this early?

I have two boys as well but I am happy either way. I would say you are having a boy but even at 35 weeks they can never be 100% until that baby pops out you won't 100% know.

01/21/2015  That looks like a boy to me. I also just want to point out that it really makes me sad that people continue to say they are devastated over the gender of their baby. I understand being sad or disappointed, but I can't fathom people continuously saying devastated. If my house burned to the ground, or my dog died, i'd be devastated. Not over my baby being a boy or a girl.      I agree. I reallly realllllllly want a boy, but I'd be just as happy with another little girl. Girls are so easy to shop for and have so many different clothing options! Clothing could be considered a blessing and a curse though...... Lol ! All I care about is getting my baby to the outside as healthily as possible!

Of course after two girls, you have hope for a boy for third. I think it's ok to feel sad for gender. We will get over it and love the baby to the moon and back. We should support each other....we vent here, let it out, and that's it.    But back to your ultrasound, it does look like a boy. My second one was told it was a boy at 15 weeks. Now I look back, that part just like a swollen girl parts.    --  Renee (6/2010), Elizabeth (T21, 11/2011)                     Report this comment        4                     almaa91    Posted 01/21/2015      They told me boy too but I was only 14 weeks a little early to be 100% sure but the tech says it's pretty obvious though I was hoping for a girl too but at the end of the day as long as my baby is healthy that is all I ask for don't matter the gender                       Report this comment        1                     sheaberry    Group Owner  Posted 01/21/2015      That's a boy, for sure.    --  Group Owner, July 2015                     Report this comment        2                     BradnBrandi's Bunch    Posted 01/21/2015     Devastated??

I asked mine if there was any chance she was wrong (I couldn't believe I am having a boy!) and she says to me "I do this for a living, 10-20 times a day, sorry, but I know what I'm seeing", lol. I had a normal OB appointment 5 days later and the doc also said it was a boy.    I think the biggest chances¬†for change are when the little boy is hiding and the tech thinks it's a girl.

This sometimes happens because the girl parts are swollen. At 16 weeks with a good tech and quality machine the chances of it being wrong are low. I had mine at almost 17 weeks and my tech got a quality gender shot right away and it was pretty obvious it was a girl. Her parts weren't swollen, so it looked pretty flat, but with the three lines.

At 16w I was told boy and she said she saw a clear distinction between the umbillical cord and the "penis." At 21 weeks the tech said that it looked like a girl but that it was hard to tell. At 23 weeks they said the baby was for sure a girl.  I hear a lot that it's common to mistake boys as girls if you can see a penis so what I'm confused about is how this happened? How could they see a penis before and now there isn't one??  Does it happen fairly often that boys turn into girls??

Everything was blue & decorated for a boy, and then a girl came out.¬† This was within the last year.¬† That's the only one I've heard about, but I don't know that many pregnant people, either.    --  H appily married to my best friend, Jamie, since 9/8/07 Expecting our¬†rainbow baby¬†on 8/8/09...Its a GIRL..Riley (needs a middle name)                     Report this comment        5                     Turtle75    Posted 05/04/2009      Hard to say with out seeing the images and with out knowing the experience of the person doing the scan.  Boys and girls start out looking very similar.¬† They both have protrusions. In some cases that protrusion can still be there at 15-16 weeks and can be mistaken for boy parts if the scanner is not careful.¬† That's why I like to penis AND scrotum when I ID a boy.¬† That way I know for sure.  An ultrasound is only as good as the person who does it.¬† It is very if not soley operator dependent.¬† Mistakes can and do happen but most of those mistakes are made when gender ID is attempted too early and/or by someone not properly trained/experienced or qualified.

She said that the 3D place much have gotten a pic of the umbilical cord instead of a penis. My baby was very uncooperative for the doctor's office tech to see all the way till 32 weeks but always commented that she thought that she seen labia but couldn't get a good veiw to correctly predict the gender.

I was shocked because I had this feeling that it was a girl. I already have a 2.5 yr old son and his ultrasound showed a clear turtle head between his legs. This one looks very weird...like when is SUPPOSED to be the scrotum (I see no penis) is shaped like an oval and is out of place.¬† There appears to be other stuff near by so it looks like we're mistaking something else for boy bits.Take a look at my profile and there's a picture called "ultrasound 09." My OB's office claims that the tech is good and I shouldn't worry. But something tells me otherwise...maybe mother intuition??

They had us come in for a 2nd ultrasound because they didn't get a clear view of the umbilical cord. At the 2nd ultrasound at 23 weeks the ultrasound tech said she couldn't say for sure either way but that it could be a girl. The only view we got was from the bum with the legs together. Do you know if a scrotum can look like a vagina? At both ultrasounds I could see how they thought it was a boy and then a girl so I have NO idea.    --  Amy, wife to Chris SAHM to Jack Christopher , 8-25-09, Sydney Rae 04-14-11 and Brooke Rylie 1-23-13!

She had 4 ultrasounds throughout her pregnancy that all said girl, the baby was born this morning and is very definitely a boy  When sonographers get it wrong, is it usually scan says girl/baby is really a boy (as opposed to the other way around?) I'm guessing its pretty rare, I haven't ever known anyone to have this happen before!?   Edited by Two4Me, 03 September 2011 - 06:12 PM.

When I had my last baby I met a lady who had been told she was having a baby girl but ended up delivering a baby boy instead.¬†¬†After the baby was born she said she asked the midwives how 'she' was and said the midwives then looked at her strangely and said 'she'?¬†¬†That was when she found out that the little girl she was expecting was infact a little boy. My best friend decided she would find out the gender of her last (fourth) baby after not having found out with her other 3.¬†¬†She was told several times that she was having a girl, and after 3 boys she was very excited.¬†¬†She ended up having one more scan before giving birth and was then told a boy at this scan.¬†¬†Boy #4 ended up arriving.¬†¬†He was in a breech position up until the last scan so that might have had something to do with it.¬†¬†She regrets trying to find out the gender during the pregnancy and if they had have said boy all along she would have been happier with that. I have a friend who was initially told girl that turned into a boy, but she was initially told a girl during the 1st trimester scan so not very accurate then I guess.     Back to top                #5   Veritas Vinum Arte    Posted 04 September 2011 - 05:08 AM    I had a GF who from the 20wk scan was expecting 'Olivia' and then I was surprised when the txt came to announce the arrival of 'Oliver'. For me my 12wk scan I was told BOY, then at 20wk scan told GIRL and had DD for #3, but that was an early 12wk scan.

Back to top                #8   BusyMum2014    Posted 04 September 2011 - 11:51 AM    Yes it 'can' happen but with modern technology, it doesnt happen too often. I have known of this happening to one person, however, she was only given a 70% chance that it was a girl and it turned out a boy. I think sonographers are more likely to be wrong if they determine that a girl is a girl based on a lack of male bits. I think it is meant to be pretty spot on if they see the 3 lines typical of a girl. This was what I was told. I am having a girl and was told 99.9% girl as they clearly saw the 3 lines.     Back to top                #9   mccarro    Posted 04 September 2011 - 12:54 PM    It's much more common for it to be wrong if you get told a girl at the gender scan.There's no denying boy bits as they're pretty clear to see on a scan when the baby makes it obvious, but as PP said the absence of boy bits can very easily get mistaken for a girl, when they simply can't get a good enough look in that area to be sure. I found out with DS, and he bared himself to us, and I'm going to find out again, but unless they can tell me with more than 95% certainty that it's a girl, then I'll assume it still could be either.

Second child, my brother didn't want to know but his partner did. She was told a boy at her 20 week scan. Because my brother didn't want to know, they stuck with buying gender neutral clothes. Lucky because DD2 was born. Third child, they both wanted to know, and had a 3D scan. They were told definitely a boy, but instead DD3 was born.

My friend pregnant at the same time had 2 scans at 19 weeks and 35 weeks and was told both times she was having a girl and out popped a boy. Also another lady at work was so excited she was finally having a girl, only to have another boy - her DP had to repaint the bedroom while she was in hospital as it was very pink.       Back to top                #10   Myprincesses    Posted 14 May 2011 - 05:45 PM    A friend of mine was told they were having a girl.

Back to top                #12   *Minnie*    Posted 14 May 2011 - 07:02 PM    I'm worried now!

Back to top                #13  Guest_sunnycat_*   Posted 14 May 2011 - 08:03 PM    QUOTE (EvaFaithful @ 14/05/2011, 06:50 PM) <{POST_SNAPBACK}> Are you worried abut your scan sunnycat? I had my anatomy scan at 18w3d rather than closer to 20 weeks so am wondering how accurate it is. The place I went said anytime between 18 weeks to 22 weeks was fine but then others have mentioned that 19 weeks is better because you get a clearer image.     Back to top                #14   mumebaby    Posted 15 May 2011 - 10:46 AM    Well 19 wks told one sex, then obs said the other 3wks later. Will see in 11 wks I guess when it comes out!     Back to top                #15   soapy    Posted 15 May 2011 - 10:50 AM    My friend was told girl and it was a boy. You could get a 3D scan to be sure. That's what I did.     Back to top                #16   ~J_F~    Posted 15 May 2011 - 10:54 AM    Another who had a friend told at 20 weeks it was a girl. She named it and her and her kids call the the baby by name and had door signs with the name on them and towels made.... We got a text saying she had a boy and had no idea on names and that she had nothing for him to wear. She had a lot of trouble bonding with the baby.      Back to top                #17   Brinny    Posted 19 May 2011 - 11:05 PM    I was told boy with DS and he is all boy. This time around though I was told boy at 17w then at the 20w scan was told girl until the very end of the scan when she noticed boy bits and so did I. So DS2 is on the way, unless the boy bits vanish lol Will be getting them to double check at the 30w scan       Back to top                #18   briandrea    Posted 20 May 2011 - 09:01 AM    With my second I was told grl but we obviously had a boy! (I had had a feeling anyway so wasn't that suprised) OP, it seems that most of the innacurate genders are girls that 'turn' into boys if that makes you feel any better. FWIW, we wont be finding out if there is a third, it was really annoying to be told the wrong sex.       Back to top                #19   7girly-girls    Posted 20 May 2011 - 09:12 AM    Not me personally but my hairdresser was told she was having a girl but went on to have a boy. Apparently stats show it is more common for boys to be mistaken as girls earlier on rather than the other way around (according to my sonographer).     Back to top                #20   EmilyStrange    Posted 20 May 2011 - 09:32 AM    I think it's odd that the stats say that more boys are mistakenly identified as girls in early scans, considering that girls bits actually differentiate from what looks like boys bits to begin with, if that makes sense... My mum wanted to bet against DH's prediction that our bub is a boy - $100 to the winner, but DH didn't accept the bet.¬†¬†I was told yesterday at my scan (19w6d) that my bub is a boy, and I was a little disappointed because I was convinced it was a girl... My mum still believes it's a girl, so asked DH if he still wanted to bet, which he's now accepted!¬†¬†Hahaha...¬†¬†He just feels bad about taking $100 off my mum, but we'll see who's right when bub is born! So we have to start thinking of boys names because we don't have any boys names we like.¬†¬†If bub turns out to be a girl, we already have girls names sorted out at least.¬†¬†Also not so bad dressing a girl in blue clothes than dressing a boy in pink clothes, not that it matters when they're newborns anyway!      Back to top                #21   briandrea    Posted 20 May 2011 - 09:36 AM    We were shown the three lines that indicate GIRL with both our DD and DS. Our sonographer was very confident we were having another 'little princess' according to her. She was wrong.       Back to top                #22   Ingrid the Swan    Posted 20 May 2011 - 09:51 AM    The midwife who ran our antenatal classes said that 20% of people who are told the baby's sex at the 20 week scan are told wrong. The midwife was slightly prone to exaggeration but she'd been looking after a girl who, days after the birth, was rejecting the baby for being the wrong sex, so... We're pretty definite on our little bundle - the only thing bubs would sit still for long enough to let us see at 28 weeks was her privates (lol) and they were clear. However, we do have a boys' name shortlist picked just in case.      Back to top                #23   stelepe    Posted 20 May 2011 - 01:36 PM    One of my friends was told she was having a girl right throughout her pregnancy and then she ended up having a boy...and now my neice is pregnant and she was told boy then at her 30 week scan they said it was a girl so we will see when bubs is born.     Back to top                #24   maneki_neko    Posted 21 May 2011 - 11:10 AM    Hope not! I came here to find out the same thing - the u/s technician was pretty confident she was looking at a girl at the 18week scan, but I won't believe it till I see a baby girl out in the world! Could def see the three lines etc so am leaning towards believing her, though. I have a follow-up scan next week (for other reasons) but am going to ask them to check again then       Back to top                #25   EvaFaithful    Posted 21 May 2011 - 11:22 AM    I had a scan at 18+2 and he was in a fUnny position so was told 80% chance a boy.

So the question - to those that have been told girl - did they actually SHOW you anything?¬†¬†Im assuming there isnt much to see!¬†¬†But thought Id find out from a group of people whether this is the norm for a girl as we are in unchartered territory.. And FWIW Ill be keeping receipts and not washing anything pink until we have our 3D scan in 9 weeks time just to be sure       Back to top                #2   Tan17    Posted 14 March 2008 - 06:42 AM    Hi Nics I also had a girl after having 2 boys and was very surprised when they said it was girl after our 19 week scan.¬†¬†We were shown 3 lines I think they are pelvic lines which only girls have and this confirmed it was indeed a girl.¬†¬†I did get them to check at another scan later on just incase, as everything I had bought was pink. I would definately get them to check at your next scan just to put your mind at ease, I really hope they were right. Wishing you all the best      Back to top                #3   anon60    Posted 14 March 2008 - 06:46 AM    We have friends who when having their first baby 2years ago, were told absolutely, definitely a girl. "She" turned out to be a very healthy 8lb boy.   Edited by anon60, 14 March 2008 - 06:47 AM.      Back to top                #4   amicrazy    Posted 14 March 2008 - 06:51 AM    We were also shown the 3 white lines in teh ultrasound. If¬†¬†they are going off teh lack of boy bits, them i would try and have it confirmed again.      Back to top                #5   mumsthe1    Posted 14 March 2008 - 06:55 AM    No ultrasound is 100% even 3d/4d. These was a thread about this last week in the what do you think? thread about being told 100% it was a girl, the op had washed everything and set up the baby room all girly only to give birth to a boy. I was told a girl also, the sono told me that she couldn't see any dangly bits either but she said that she wasn't comfortable for us to go out and buy pink just yet. If you want to buy pink,¬†¬†I would keep all tags on and make sure you have some neutral item just in case it turns out to be a boy.      Back to top                #6   BugBiEz    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:26 AM    I had a girl first, my sonographer didn't show me anything she just told me shes been doing this for a long time and she was 95% sure she was a girl... She got it right but I didn't buy anything pink till I had another scan at 25 weeks. She was right! I had a healthy 8lb girl       Back to top                #7   Nics    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:25 AM    Thanks to the replies so far... FWIW I dont mind if it is a boy....¬†¬†after all its what Im used to!¬†¬†I was just worried that I wasnt actually "shown" anything (ie the 3 lines) so not sure how good a guess it really was.... and if I should start planning for a pink one! Well looks like Ill have to wait another 9 weeks and see what the prediction is then - if they say girl again Ill believe it however if they say boy ill take all things pink back to the shops  Thinking about it - the sonograopher was pretty thorough (the u/s took 1 1/2 hours to complete!) so Im assuming if there was anything to see she would have seen it and showed us!!¬†¬†She was probably sick of looking at the same baby after that length of time!      Back to top                #8   LovingMyGirls    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:40 AM    I have 2 daughters and found out the sex for both of them (at a number of u/sounds).¬†¬†Girl bits can definately be seen on ultrasound but it could just be the way the sonographer chose to tell you.¬†¬†They can always make mistakes but I think would feel pretty certain to tell someone the sex.      Back to top                #9  Guest_Jamiesmummy_*   Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:48 AM    They usually will say they cant tell if they dont know, we wanted to find out with all of ours and with my fourth bub they told me they couldnt tell as she had her legs crossed and was very modest, lol. She didnt want to show her bits. So cute. At a later scan they showed us what they nicely termed the hamburger, the three lines. lol.     Back to top                #10   Princess.cranky.pants    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:53 AM    We were told DD was a girl but didn't get shown anything. Sometimes they assume it's a girl when they can't see any boy bits. Also keep in mind that 3D scans can be wrong too. The person that was told girl and had a boy, had a 3D gender determination scan. We never believed we were really having a girl till she was born. If I had boys first I would be even less inclined to believe it. I didn't do a pink nursery or buy everything pink.      Back to top                #11   lovemy3    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:55 AM    It's so frustrating isn't it when you don't know just how sure they were? The same thing happened to me with DS. She didn't actually come right our and say you're definately having a boy. We saw the bits, but I wondered whether because I was hoping for a little boy I'd just imagined it.  After going out straight after the u-sound and buying blue stuff, I actually rang up the radiology place and asked to speak to the lady who had done my u-sound. I explained to her my predicament and asked if she could remember. Her reply was "It was most definately a boy, there was penis and testicles everywhere I looked!!" I felt a bit more confident then! Good luck to you!     Back to top                #12   cremello    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:03 AM    We could see three distinct white lines with my DD at 19 weeks, I wouldn't trust a sex prediction based on her not being able to see any external genitalia. Then again I still didn't trust my US, or even the 4D one until I had her in my arms. Still bought lots of pink but terrified she would be blue not pink!      Back to top                #13   jessf    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:05 AM    With my first they didn't "show" us anything on the u/s the sonographer just said "and there's it's girly bits" and went straight to another part of the body and I had to stop her and say "are we having a girl?" and she just said "yes" and as you can see by my sig- we have a happy and healthy 1 year old girl! Good luck (although I agree- I didn't take tags off anything and just washed the "both-gender" items!)      Back to top                #14   Cantankerous    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:11 AM    I was told girl at 20 weeks. He was pretty sure but didnt show us anything and I was over the moon and brought all pink things. Then I had another quick scan a week ago after leaking fluid and I asked her to check again. She quickly did and showed me the 3 lines and said I'm pretty sure of a girl but I'm not with 100% because we are simply not allowed to say 100%. First guy told us 80% girl Its a whole lot better than DS one. 51% chance of boy, gee thanks what was the point of even telling me that!      Back to top                #15   natcul    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:20 AM    We were told at our 20 week ultrasound 60% girl.¬†¬†They didnt show me any bits. I had a 4D ultrasound at 36 weeks and we were told again that its a girl. I havent gone overboard buying the pink stuff.¬†¬†Ive only bought a few girlie bits and pieces that can be returned.¬†¬†Nursery is pretty neutral. You never really know until its born i guess!!!      Back to top                #16   woopsadaisy    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:40 AM    I find it a bit odd to say without dangly bits it must be a girl, our sonographer was very clear with us, and showed us the 3 white lines, indicating girl - and she was (is!). In fact when I questioned how accurate his reading was I was told in no uncertain terms, "it's a GIRL!" This time around it was SO obviously a boy the sonographer just said,'Well what do you think?'      Back to top                #17   Eizzor    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:50 AM    We seen this (|) clearly on the ultrasound....the three lines.      Back to top                #18   Moonlitdreams    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:52 AM    My bub was spread eagle and the sonographer said 'there isn't anything in between and if it were a boy, there would be by now. I asked her about the 3 lines and that I heard people were shown the formation of the girly bits and she told me it's really a matter of 'is it there or is it not' I don't know if I was happy with that answer considering so many people are shown the bits. I have bought 5 items pink and everything else nuetral but it's so hard these days as everything is blue or pink.       Back to top                #19   PinkyBlue    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:55 AM    You would be suprised how easier it is to see a girl over a boy. DD was dead easy without the sonographer telling us at first...3 lines like a hamburger and even ovaries...it took me awhile to work out DS..I couldnt guess at first.      Back to top                #20   clumpy    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:58 AM    QUOTE So the question - to those that have been told girl - did they actually SHOW you anything? Im assuming there isnt much to see! Well there is, it's just a different shape! (The way some people talk about there being 'nothing there' you'd think females didn't have genitals...) The hamburger is the labia, vagina and sometimes the clitoris depending what angle they're at. Because of complications I had 4 scans and each time they said it was 99.5% likely to be a girl, and showed us. It was pretty clear, but I still left the tags on even vaguely gender-specific clothing.      Back to top                #21   **Xena**    Posted 14 March 2008 - 10:03 AM    I have also been told girl after two boys and still don't really believe it! Luckily a friend had given us all her pink baby stuff and I already have blue baby stuff so I have decided to just play wait and see. The sonographer also just used the "can't see any dangly bits" line and I was so shocked after two boys that I just forgot to ask if he saw the lines. Bubs legs were wide open so I don't know if he used those terms for my benefit or if he didn't look for labia etc! However before he had told me the sex I thought I had seen 3 lines so I guess I will find out at the end of May. I have bought some beautiful neutral bedlinen just in case    Edited by 1~plus~2, 14 March 2008 - 01:40 PM.

He pointed out that he couldn't see any boy bits, and could see the umbilical cord clearly, and he could make out the 3 white lines and after he said "I would put money on a girl" That still isn't 100% for me, so I am keeping my mind open to the possibility it could be a boy.. just in case. DS has thought it was a girl from 6wks, so he still called it ‚Äúmy sister‚Äù‚Ä¶   Edited by Alina0210, 14 March 2008 - 11:00 AM.       Back to top                #24   bec4    Posted 14 March 2008 - 11:16 AM    We were told a girl and I didn't believe her - after having three boys.¬†¬†Also DD not being my DH I didn't believe he could make little girls.¬†¬†I asked her to check again and she said she had checked about three times during the scan and then another lady came in and checked as well.¬†¬†They showed us the three lines also. I could also tell that our last DS was a boy - I knew before they told us, I guess I knew what I was looking for But I could not tell with this one, so I am pretty sure they are right. I have only bought some pink blankets and a few grow suits.¬†¬†Everything else pink has been given to me.¬†¬†I still have all the boy stuff though - just in case. Just to let you know - we only ever had the 20 week scan with all our DS and they were all predicted right.

I think with girl predictions you have to still remain open minded cause there seems to be more slip ups with these ones.

Pumpkin Patch are evil geniuses; their clothes are so beautiful and they have sales! Our sonographer said 'strong chance' its a girl. I saw three white lines, and I have felt strongly from the word go that this one is a girl. I'll be totally shocked if its a boy; not because I don't want another boy - I do, but because I feel so strongly that this is a girl... As my sister said, "You are mentally prepared to have a girl this time."

I saw the 3 white lines and thats all that matters to me, thats what led the sonographer to say girl too because of those pretty white lines. A question for ladies that were told girl and later found it was a boy>>>> did you see anything, were you shown the 3 white lines?? Or were you just told with no evidence??

Marisa - I was shown those 3 white lines as reassurance at my u/s too. I have never known anyone who was told the wrong sex during an u/s, I guess it depends how trained the sonographer is etc.¬†¬†I made the sonographer check 3 times.

I know they are usually not 100% sure but friends and family have been told 80% not 60-70%. Have you had this experience?¬†¬†If so what was the outcome.¬†¬†I feel as if I'm having a girl but would have loved the confirmation today. Thanks      Back to top                #2   littlesuzie    Posted 12 July 2007 - 05:05 PM    Hi there, I saw my ob at 16 weeks and she asked if I wanted to know.¬†¬†She said she couldn't get the best view as bubs was moving alot, but she said that she 'couldn't see any dangly bits' and that she was 'leaning towards a girl.'¬†¬†I know it's hard, I think it's worse being told something like '70% sure' or 'girl, but not sure', than not knowing at all. I'm hoping that they'll be able to tell me in 2 weeks at my 19 week scan. Are you able to get another scan done that might be able to give you a more definite answer?

There are companies that do non-medical scans later in pregnancy where you can have another try. They're often not cheap, you can't claim any of it on Medicare or health insurance, and obviously bubs isn't always compliant but if you're keen to find out it's an option. Some of them let you come back if you don't see the sex the first time. A lot of them are the 3D/4D scans which is also very cool. Here's a list , or you can try googling "3D ultrasound" and your closest city centre.      Back to top                #8   mikaylas-mum    Posted 12 July 2007 - 06:36 PM    Thanks for all your replies! clumpy - Thanks for the list of non-medical ultrasound clinics.¬†¬†My Ob does an ultrasound at every visit and I see him again in 2 weeks so I'll ask him to confirm it then. Sorry, I should have mentioned that in my original post. priscilla01 - Wow, you have 4 girls and you're pregnant again?¬†¬†I've got 1 DD and this is my second.¬†¬†We plan to have 3 children so I know I'll have another.¬†¬†Deep down I probably was hoping for a boy, but hey, as long as bub is healthy that is the main thing.¬†¬†A little sister for Mikayla is also lovely!! luckymum - Yeah I think that is why the sonographer said girl because she couldn't see any boy bits.¬†¬†She did seem a little young so maybe she doesn't have that much experience.¬†¬†I was a little upset that she didn't take much time to look.¬†¬†She made sure the baby was ok and healthy and said ok we're done.¬†¬†I said what about the sex of the baby, I'd like to find out.¬†¬†My DH left the room and she had a look for all of 2 mins.¬†¬†My DH said he thinks it's a boy because of how quick I was, he said it must have been really obvious to her Wow your cousin got told girl and had a boy, what a surprise that must have been. ~FƒπoWe¬Æ T√µT~ - Lucky you have have it confirmed!!¬†¬†So what are you having LOL!!! 3walk1fly - I wish I did have pics because I'd post them on here for you girls to give me your opinions I didn't get any pics because DH doesn't want to know, I was scared he'd find them.¬†¬†Yeah, 60-70% chance is very frustrating, I would have rathered her say she couldn't tell. -Hannahmania- - Hi Sharon!! Congrats on your little boy!!¬†¬†I'll update you when I have my scan with the OB in 2 weeks. littlesuzie - Yeah it is worse being told there is a 60-70% chance.¬†¬†I'll have another scan in 2 weeks!!

DH and I want to find out with ours, but I think what we will do is tell the Sonographer that we want to know, but only if they are 80%-90% sure... any less than that I think I would rather not know. Although we would be happy with anything (this pregnancy has been 5 years coming and is an IVF baby), I think i would struggle with finding out on ultrasound it is a girl, then giving birth to a boy, and vice versa.... so I think i would¬†¬†really want more than 70% sure if you knwo what I mean.

I was feeling a little today about the professionalism of the sonographer yesterday.¬†¬†She didn't really give me re-assurance that the baby was healthy until I asked at the end, didn't tell me the heart rate and didn't tell me that my due date is slightly ahead. I realised that the date had changed when I was watching the dvd last night . Not to mention the uncertainty of the sex. Today I went to Medicare and claimed for the $250 fee I paid yeterday, I only got $80 back.¬†¬†When I got home I called head office and complianed about the sonographer.¬†¬†The person I spoke to said she should have told me she couldn't give me a definate answer and left it at that.¬†¬†So, after all that I've booked in for a complimentary ultrasound on Monday at 10:40am.¬†¬†I'll be back in around lunch time on Monday to update you all, hopfully I'll get a more definate boy/ girl answer and the assurance that my baby is perfectly healthy  suzi1973 - I know what you mean about not being sure, I suppose for you there is that 10% chance it could be a boy..lol.¬†¬†I was shopping today and was tempted to buy a cute pink jumpsuit but didn't due to the uncertainty.¬†¬†Wow, your friend must have been shocked when she gave birth to a boy.¬†¬†I hope you get confirmaion at your scan in 2 weeks!! mumma~soon - Great idea to tell the sonographer you only want to know if he/she is 80/90% sure.¬†¬†I wish I would have done that yesterday. I'm glad I have a repeat scan on Monday, just so I know either way.¬†¬†It's funny, if she would have told me there was no way she could be certain I would have left it at that.¬†¬†I've now got this uncertainty in my mind and must find out, it's driving me crazy!! LittleMissL - I've got a strong feeling it is a girl, but the 60-70% thing gives me doubts. patricks_ma - Wow, so I could still be carrying a boy..I'll soon know on Monday!!     Back to top                #16   4forme    Posted 13 July 2007 - 08:52 PM    A my 18 week scan I was told 80% boy, and since I'd never been told in a percentage before I soemtimes wonder if I really am having a boy. Sometimes I correct myself and think i must be though as my sonographer marked on the dvd 'xy' where she pointed out the supposed boy bits, so I figure maybe it's right for her to do that. Not long to wait and see for sure, but gee it can be frustrating.

And I also don't believe it that whole "80% likely to have the same gender"... This is my 3rd, i have 2 girls and am having a boy this time according to the panorama blood test. My cousin has 2 girls and is due any day now with a boy.. my mom had 2 boys then had me.. a friend of mine has 2 girls and just had a boy a couple months ago... So that theory is dead to me, lol. I'd wait and find out for sure at 18-20 weeks. At 14 weeks, that area is still very swollen, so I wouldn't trust it. Reply  Close g  gmtalian Oh good question. I just had an ultrasound ¬†at 12 weeks and the doctor said he thinks it's a boy. My heart broke a little cuz we already have a boy, and I'm 40 yrs old. There's no way I'm going for a 3rd time.

One blessing with the same sex children is the friendship they will have growing up and in adulthood - each child is individual and my two girls are nothing alike and I have now doubt if I have number 3 girl she will also be her own person and not like either of my other two...

Try to be patient and wait for the anatomy scan. v  vmunn 13 weeks is very early. My ultrasound tech guessed boy at 12 weeks. But that early it is an educated guess. I have my scan on Friday as well so we will see. I am not counting on the early scan though. J  JessicaDHarris My friend was told boy at 15-16 weeks and then the next scan at 20 weeks they said nvm its a girl!! I think 12-13 weeks is just a guess, they are so small it's hard to see b  babyearfras I know someone who was told girl at 20 weeks and then nope here's your baby boy. Save to say there's always a chance it's wrong even later one in pregnancy E  EmerysMom @aajohnson92  At 12w5d we were told Boy at our NT scan. Tech said 70%. At 16w4d private scan baby is ALL girl. Legs were wide open and very clear. h  helloufo @aajohnson92  on92 at our 12 week 3 day ultrasound we were given a 70% chance of a boy. 3 weeks later blood work came back and it was 100% a girl. We also saw her lady bits at a 17 week ultrasound and they looked completely different than the 12 week one. It definitely went from an outtie to a hamburger. S  StacyandSam we were told boy at 12w then girl at 18w. It can definitely happen m  mdfultz I'll let you know tomorrow. I was told boy at 12 weeks but I have doubts since it was so early. We go tomorrow for our anatomy scan so we'll find out for sure then! j  jkerr1012 We were told boy at almost 15 weeks and then told girl at 18 weeks. I didn't see any boy parts at the 15 scan so I was a little too nervous to start buying boy stuff. On the 18 weeks scan, you could see as clear as day that there were absolutely no boy parts there! B  BumpItUp @aajohnson92  Yep!! Not my but my friend. e  erinkay75 13 weeks is too early to be told anything unless via blood draw. This is one of those things that just makes my blood boil! The penis and vagina look very similar up until about 18 weeks. While there have been people who have been given the right gender early via scan, it's more of a coincidence that it was correct. Either way, just remember how blessed you are to be carrying this child. S  Serenawsu For sure. ¬†Our 13 week scan they told us it was a girl, but that early it is only about 70% right according to our technician. 4  4toolove @helloufo  I had blood work too and they told me I'm having a girl. I have an ultrasound next week, but knowing your blood work was accurate puts me a little more at ease! L  LittleBabyZ2051 @aajohnson92  We were told boy at an 11 weeks scan. A week and a half later we got panorama results and it's a girl! Girl parts were confirmed at our 20 weeks scan. m  mrskjfrench At 15 + 2 weeks doc said he thinks he sees boy parts. Now I'm nervous for the anatomy scan on the 29th because hubby was over the moon excited!! :( what do you ladies think??? & then to top it off a show about people born with both parts came on & now a wreck! t  teentje At 16 weeks they told me girl, later at 22 weeks they told me boy.. I already had the nursery done at 20 weeks all light pink because we were traveling from 23 tot 35 weeks. Got home at 36 weeks and managed to change nursery from pink to blue just in time :p m  mdfultz Me again...turns out they were wrong at my 12 week, they said boy and today (18weeks) we found out we're having our third Girl! s  skiesforeyes I was told boy at 15 weeks, but my anatomy scan is in a week and a half, and I'm almost convinced it's going to be a girl. I saw a penis in the ultrasound picture at first, but now I see a vagina. I even posted the picture on here, and everyone said boy.....but I'm just preparing myself for this baby to be a girl. (P.S.

I'll see if I can upload a pic to show u the boy, your certainly having a girl she wouldn't miss a willy on the scan, there not allowed to say 100% what it is that's why she's said if it was a boy, mine was the same G  GlamMomof3FL @LittleLady2015  With my last pregnancy I was told girl at my anatomy scan. I went in for another ultrasound one week before I delivered and sure enough it was a little BOY!!!! Talk about surprise of a lifetime! This was 6 years ago. a  alphabeth This happened to my therapist about 18 years ago. I was told girl through the Cell Free DNA test, and also that it's 99% accurate, but I've been worried ever since that I'm in that 1%! I want to get confirmation through an ultrasound before I buy anything. Hopefully with two methods of sex determination I'll feel more comfortable. In addition to finding what *isn't* there -- y chromosome, penis -- there should be three lines on an ultrasound that indicate girl. The anatomy scan is detailed and also will examine baby's genitalia¬†along with everything else. L  LittleLady2015 Thanks everyone! j  jensmith328 My sister was told girl at 16 weeks. He was a boy two weeks later at the anatomy scan. k  kristi7420 Just Wait until your March 2nd¬†ultrasound which is probably your Anatomy Scan. The Anatomy scan the baby is developed enough for a clear gender. Yes you can see if it's a boy or girl at 16 weeks but if you want to be sure wait to buy anything until the Anatomy scan ultrasound. Because right now is not a for Sure gender. There are still plenty of things you can buy without gender, like the crib, dresser, hangers, breast feeding clothes or supplies for you, etc. Here is my Anatomy Scan ultrasound which clearly shows what I am having. ;-) p  piperchapman Not me, but I have 2 friends that were told girl at 15 and 16 weeks and both had boys. One was born last year and the other 3 years ago, so pretty recent. h  hannah_gabrielle This happened to my half sister! Her mother was told she was having a boy and it was a girl. Obviously :) lol This was almost 17 years ago though so the chances of making a mistake like that are probably much slimmer. At least I would hope so! :| h  haleyanne01 My friend this year was told 100% girl at her 18 week anatomy, delivered a boy. It was shocker that's forsure! K  KAS0821 @LittleLady2015  Last may we threw a shower for our friends who were having a girl due at the end of June. She received everything pink. One week later and about a month before her due date they saw a penis on the ultrasound. She delivered a boy three weeks later K  KAS0821 @kerryatkin  This is simply untrue. Of course they can miss the penis on a scan!!!!! j  jaydengreen @LittleLady2015  Definitely had a huge girl baby shower and name picked out for a boy. m  mommabear2323 Yes, sadly for me at 16 weeks I was told by 2 techs it was definitely all girl.. went back for gender u/s and was told boy instead with clear view of boy parts. This will be my second boy. Good luck! b  blessedmommy_2015 This happened to my SIL and her son will be 16! She has me so paranoid because I am falling in love with my daughter and I just want her healthy and alive! Nothing more or less.... T  TinyDancer611 @LittleLady2015  You mention that they saw nothing, but did they see the three lines indicative of a girl? If not, there's still a chance that you could be having a boy. They likely wouldn't tell you because they truly weren't sure at that point. g  ghedrick On Friday of last week, the L&D dr said it might definitely be a girl. On Monday the ultrasound tech said boy with obvious visuals, so it can happen. Get gift receipts for everything....cause you'll only know for sure when baby is born. t  tam0718 My son is almost two now. But at 14 weeks and 16 weeks we where told girl because of three flat lines. I asked for the head Sono tech Joe, the teacher.he came in went over my sono again at 16 weeks and ask.was we told what we were having I said yes a girl.. He was like no your having a BOY..penis hadn't dropped but his scrotum was there. I clearly couldn't see he said you have to have a trained eye. He doesn't recommend giving gender results before 20 weeks. Because baby still growing and things can be swollen.

So I say it's not 70% at all. Not trying to be mean. b  bskeel1 @jessica_l84  You can't even tell at 12 weeks so I would say it can go either way v  vghjkkgg They also told me 70% at my 12 week scan she said she's pretty certain but has to say 70% just incase go for my 20 week scan on Friday will confirm it then :) b  beachbummbaby I did an early elective u/s with my first at 14 weeks.

But my 20 week us is tomorrow so I wouldn't get your hopes up that little a  acottri @jessica_l84  This is exactly what just happened to me. I'm a FTM and was told around 13 weeks we were having a boy and 20 week anatomy scan would confirm. We spent the next seven weeks buying clothes, naming him, referring to the baby as him, as Colton (the name we chose) and our son and became over the moon for a little boy. At the 20 week anatomy scan, the tech said "oh looks like a healthy baby girl, 99.9% sure!!" We still love our daughter just as much but are in a way grieving the little baby boy we never had but we had convinced ourselves we were bonding with. My SO was so excited for a little boy to taking fishing and hunting and all things little boys do with their daddy's. Not to say he doesn't love the baby girl we are expecting, but over the last almost two months we in a way built a life in our head with a boy. It has only been 3 days since we found out so we are slowly adjusting. I returned all my boy clothes I bought and exchanged them for girl ones. I am definitely loving the thought of a daughter but I am still adjusting. This may all sound kind of dramatic but I am new at this and was kind of crushed when we were told something we didn't see coming. But like I said, we are coming around and love her just as much :) for your sanity don't assume she is right until you have a clear clear picture of the baby's goods! I don't want you to do what I did! Hope this helps. d  dog-lover I was told boy at 13 weeks and it ended up being a girl at 20 weeks! d  dog-lover I was told boy at 13 weeks and it ended up being a girl at 20 weeks!

K  Kessy08 The lady at my 12.5 week appointment told us she is pretty sure it's a boy. I told my husband though not to get too excited yet and to wait till I am further along. I will find out Saturday if the lady was right or not (I will be 19 weeks then). G  GwenKlackers at our 12 week scan we were told there was an 80% chance that it was a boy. When we went for our 16 week scan, which was done in 3D, doc said nope - it's 100% a girl... :) so yes i think 12 weeks is too early to confirm gender, based only my personal experience. l  lexlove33 Told girl at 13 weeks confirmed girl at 21 weeks!!!! Very obvious was a girl from 13 weeks :p I'm a believer in early scans p  preggolily14 I mentioned at my 13 week appointment how excited we were to find out and how I was tempted to get an elective US to find out the sex since we couldn't wait until our next appointment. My doctor scoffed and said it was a waste of money and they only promise a 50% accuracy. She said "flip a coin and save yourself the money". So, needless to say, we waited until our next appointment (little over 19 weeks) and used the money on a date night instead. C  CarmenAL Told us boy at 12 w and 2 days. These photos were done then.

We are supposed to be having a little girl... I would have been fine finding out my baby was a boy months ago... But if I find out 4 weeks before my due date that they were wrong... It's just going to be very, VERY hard to handle. No boy name picked out, no boy ANYTHING ready, and I've been dreaming of this little girl since I found out she was a she! Of course, I'll love him, but after 8 months of imagining and talking to one gender, it's going to be strange! Reply  Close r  routhd This is why I have been team green for all pregnancies. I had a family member who thought she was having a boy, had the name picked out since the first ultrasound, nursery decorated. When baby came out and was a girl, she grieved as though she had lost her boy. It was quite sad to see her reaction. But she obviously snapped out of it quickly enough bc all that mattered was that baby was healthy. Reply  Close d  dsomerbreeze Happened to me twice. Once 14 years ago and this pregnancy.

But Then Something Unexpected Happened by Catherine Donaldson-Evans Updated: March 10, 2015 It was the big day -- the day my husband and I would find out whether our first child was a boy or a girl. I had a sneaking suspicion I already knew. Call it maternal instinct or just a feeling I had, but I was pretty sure. My husband had the same hunch. Still, this simple gender test would be the proof. In some ways, I couldn't believe we were actually going through with this. Before I'd even met my husband, let alone gotten pregnant, I always thought I'd want to my baby's sex to be a surprise. I had fantasies of going through the nine months blissfully in the dark about what I was having until that moment in the delivery room when my doctor would announce triumphantly, "It's a boy!" or "It's a girl!" I love surprises, especially happy ones. My husband, on the other hand, does not love surprises. He kind of hates them, especially when he's on the receiving end. It would have been stressful for him to go through the entire pregnancy not knowing our baby's gender when the information was right there at our fingertips. So I didn't even try to fight it. I knew it was more important to him to find out than it was for me to be surprised. And there's still some element of mystery in learning halfway through, anyway.

My stomach was glistening with sonogram gel and my OB was moving the wand around so we could see just what kind of baby I was carrying. She zoomed in on one small square of the screen and held it there. I caught my breath, squinting at the blurry, fuzzy, black-and-white blob in front of me. "You want to know the sex, right?" she asked, stating the obvious. "Yes," we said in unison. "Well, it looks like it's a boy!" the doctor said cheerfully. There was a stunned minute-long silence. A ... boy? No. It couldn't be. I'd been so sure I was carrying a girl. I just knew it was a girl. My husband was thinking the same thing. Both of us were a tiny bit let-down. Finally, I spoke. "A boy?" I asked, incredulous. "Really? Could you show us what you're seeing? I've had a strong feeling the baby is a girl." "Sure," she replied, as if this happened all the time. She swirled the ultrasound wand around again and then zeroed in on a small section of the image. "See that little 'tinkling' there between the legs? That's the baby's penis." I had no idea what she was seeing, and I bit my lip to keep from giggling in spite of myself. Tinkling between the legs? I stole a glance at my husband. He looked like he was trying hard to keep a straight face too. And then something completely bizarre happened. My doctor did an about-face. "Wait a minute," she said, narrowing her eyes and taking off her glasses. "Hmm." "What?!" my husband blurted out. "Well, on second glance, that might just be the umbilical cord," she said distractedly, still peering intently at the sonogram image. "So I guess it could be a girl." Aha! So there was a chance! Maybe we weren't imagining those gut feelings we had after all ... "Is there a way to tell now for sure?" I asked. She tried to get the baby to move around some more in there so she could better see what that tinkling really was. But our firstborn was having none of it. He/she/it was comfortable and not budging. "Sorry about that, but you'll just have to wait for the amnio results to come back," the OB said. (I'd decided to have amniocentesis because I was over 35, just to be absolutely sure the baby was okay; an added benefit of the test is that it tells you the sex of the child with complete accuracy.) I'd heard about this sort of thing happening to other expectant moms and dads whose gender tests came out wrong at first, so they believed their baby was one gender, only to learn later that it was the other. I'd even heard of those who didn't find out the truth until the actual birth, after having gotten all this boy baby gear when it was really a girl. I never imagined that I would become one of those mixed-up-gender-test parents myself. So we did the only thing we could do. We waited. And waited. And waited. Looking back, it was a great test of my patience, which was high to begin with -- but needed to be even higher when I became a mom. And it was another one of those things that blindsides you in pregnancy and parenthood, the experiences that teach you the element of surprise is par for the course with children. Then, finally, we got the call. The amnio results were in. My doctor rattled off the good news about all the disorders the baby tested negative for. And then, at long last, she told me what I was having, in that absent-minded way she sometimes has. "Refresh my memory -- you already knew you were having a girl, right?" she asked. It's a girl! I whooped with joy, my heart soaring. My husband broke into a big grin. We were having a girl! Our inkling had been right! SEE ALSO: 19 Nature-Inspired Baby Names in Honor of Spring  Would we have gotten used to the idea of having a boy (which we did, two years later) and been just as happy about him? Of course. We would have gone with the flow, like we did with this false gender test and like we have countless times since our children were born. But there's something to be said about trusting your instincts, especially those powerful maternal ones. Sometimes they're more on the mark than all the tests and diagnoses in the world.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.        Getty Images     √ó  Study: Boy or girl? Ultrasound can be¬†wrong     Getty Images    (CNN) For expecting parents, 20 weeks is a milestone. It marks the halfway point of the 40 week pregnancy, but most excitingly it is the time many soon-to-be moms and dads find out the answer to the big question: boy or girl?  But what happens when instead of the little girl everyone has been expecting and buying clothes for a little boy ends up being born? Kyle and Danielle Williams captured their family‚Äôs reaction on camera, and their reactions went viral.  How likely is this mix up? ‚ÄúIt depends on how the baby is situated in the uterus,‚Äù said sonographer Catherine E. Rienzo, a fellow with the Society of Diagnostic Medical Sonography. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs not that easy. Size of the uterus, abdominal scars, position of the baby and other factors that can play into it. If it‚Äôs a male and the testicles haven‚Äôt descended, it can look like a female. It‚Äôs not 100%.‚Äù  Making the wrong call happens more frequently than we realize, perhaps as high as one out of ten times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that uncommon to have gender wrong,‚Äù said Dr. John Williams III, Director of Reproductive Genetics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a screening tech. They can‚Äôt make a guarantee of that. ‚Äù  In addition, in recent years, more and more women are getting cell-free fetal DNA tests that are done to screen for genetic disorders like Trisomy 18 and Downs Syndrome, but can also determine gender. These tests are a simple blood draw, done around the ten week mark that can measure fetal DNA particles that make their way into the mother‚Äôs blood. The tests are usually performed on women who are considered to be high-risk pregnancies. But Dr. Williams reiterated that these tests are not diagnostic.  Overall, Williams said that the screening methods are fairly satisfying. ‚ÄúCell-free DNA is probably 95% plus correct and ultrasound depends on who‚Äôs doing it. But if it‚Äôs done by a skilled person‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs 90% to 95% certainty on gender.‚Äù  Pregnancy and birth control by the numbers  In fact, gender determination isn‚Äôt the only thing surrounding fertility that isn‚Äôt precise. Despite everyone‚Äôs concerns about effectiveness, birth control methods can have a range of success rates. According to the Centers for Disease Control, intrauterine devices have a failure rate of between 0.2% and 0.8%, whereas hormonal methods like the traditional pill are effective about 9 out of 10 times. Barrier methods like condoms are in fact some of the least effective methods according to the CDC with a failure rate of 18%.  And if you do become pregnant, how accurate are your typical drugstore pregnancy tests? ‚ÄúOverall, they are pretty certain,‚Äù said Williams. But, he still warns that their accuracy depends on human error. ‚ÄúThere are false positives, false negatives. They frequently depend on the first morning urine, but if the patient has been drinking a lot of liquid ‚Äî it could dilute the hormone. And if it‚Äôs too low on the urine test, it will be a false positive. Things happen.‚Äù But he adds that today‚Äôs tests are more sensitive than they were 30 years ago, when they first came on the market.  Is anything certain?  So when it comes to pregnancy, is anything certain? At least when it comes to gender identification, the only way to be certain according to both Dr. Williams and Riezno is to do Chornic Villi Sampling, known as CVS, and having an amniocentesis done. ‚ÄúThe only way to do it ‚Äî is to do a diagnostic, with 99.9% certainty,‚Äù said Dr. Williams. In these tests, cells are harvested from the placenta or the amniotic sac itself, and are then cultured to sequence the chromosomes. While much more invasive, it is also much more precise.  But these tests are not done just for gender identification. ‚ÄúPhysicians would not do those scans just for that. They are looking for general abnormalities,‚Äù said Rienzo.  So, has Rienzo ever made a mistake in her 35 year career? ‚ÄúI have made a mistake one time,‚Äù she said, 18 years ago. ‚ÄúI did it on a friend of mine. She already had a girl, and I said that she was having another girl. And she actually had a boy. Obviously in the past 18 years, the technology and machines has improved. But yes, I made that mistake.‚Äù    Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network , Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

Has this happened to anyone?    We were told boy at 21 weeks and potty shot defo looked boy, just wondering how often this has happened and it turned out to be girl. In a weird way I keep daydreaming that when I give birth they will say girl.

Especially being told boy when it's a girl. The cord can get mistaken for the penis.  That's why a lot of hospitals no longer tell you the sex of the baby.

So the pram soon returned lol. I have never found out because of this reason no cause for error. But saying that with my triplets i kept dreaming i had 2 boys and girl even though i knew that was impossible as mine were identical and would all be the same sex and i had all boys.

My boyfriend, however, is a twin and despite having two ultrasound scans, they thought there was only one baby - big surprise when his brother popped out after him!

But when my mum was pregnant with me and my twin brother, they asked if the babies were the same sex and each time they said yes, two of the same, they didn't want to know if we were two boys or two girls though. They were shocked but very happy when I arrived after my brother, they already had three boys and when he arrived expected a fifth. That was 19 years ago now though and I'm sure scans are much better.

I am having my 2nd boy and altho I would be gutted if I was having a girl now as I've kind off bonded with my boy already I would still love my baby no matter what so to be honest yes it's a pain thinking ur going to have a son/daughter and buying a certain sex clothes but as long as they are healthy I don't see why it matters lol. And yeh sonographers will always say they cannot say 100% this is for the reason that a boy could be a late developer so u think it's a girl or a girl could have the cord between her legs and be mistaken for a boy X          Reply With Quote             15-05-16, 21:57    #17        Maggie M(112)    View Profile    View Forum Posts       Member         Join Date  Jan 2016  Location  Oakley  Posts  2,677          my friend got told boy and had a girl. shes nearly 14 now and I can see why they might have been confused  people say all the time that my baby ended up in my friends body because her daughter is so like me (total petrol head, tomboy ladette) and her mums such a girly girl pretty pink princess          Reply With Quote             16-05-16, 08:38    #18           Daisy G(195)    View Profile    View Forum Posts       Member         Join Date  Jan 2016  Posts  176          I work in theatres and I watched my first c section the other day, they expected a girl and popped out a boy!

She had been told by the sonographers that she was having a boy, so they can and do get it wrong. It was clearly quite difficult for the lady - she was Somali I think, and already had a daughter and I heard her several times on her phone apologising to her husband that it was another girl and asking him to come and visit them and he wouldn't. They hadn't named the baby either       Add message | Report     StrawberriesAndScream    Thu 10-Mar-11 17:52:30    Message withdrawn at poster's request.

All the stress of thinking she was having a boy and then having a girl would of been hard enough to deal with if it really was that important in your family! And it's him that determined the sex of the baby so why do they put it all on the women! If anyone should be shamed in that family it should be him!!! But to be honest, it should be a fantastic time for a family to receive a new little one! Oh the poor girl!!! Similar though, this is my third and I'm really hoping for a boy as I have two girls, but to be honest, as long as baby is healthy, girly clothes shopping is soooo much fun!!

She's in exactly this situation. But she is accepting that it's a boy not a girl. I think sonographers have more/ less doubt, but with my friend it seemed very, very clear to the sonographer that it was another boy.

The sonographer knew that I am going home to England to have the child and will stay there afterwards. I felt uncomfortable asking as there is a sign on the door saying that it is a punishable act to ask the sex of your baby. As this is my last I just was curious to know. Maybe I should have asked to see on the screen as well. Then i would have been more sure.

Something in side me was saying that the Doc was wrong. At 33 weeks my baby had grown a penis. He was just shy and still is. I knew it, I almost fell off that table!                 Jessica0901    Answered 9/24/07               36 found this helpful     Unfortunately, as accurate as we would like technology to be, it isn't always so. If your tech got a really good look all 3 times then there is a good chance the guess about a boy is right. I did have an experience, however, when they were wrong. When I was pg with my daughter (now almost 16) I was told I was carrying a boy. The tech even circle the &quot;penis&quot; and typed in &quot;boy&quot; next to it. So, we prepared for a boy thinking that since they pointed &quot;it&quot; out it had to be true. Well, you can imagine our surprise in the delivery room when I gave birth to a girl! The &quot;penis&quot; was in fact the umbilical cord and the tech misread what she was seeing. If your baby's cord is out of the way and the tech is still saying boy, then I would say the guess is probably right!                 m00ndancer    Answered 9/24/07               27 found this helpful     There's a chance that it could be wrong, but it's very small, so you can relax. The chance is small enough that there is no need to stress out about it. With 3 ultrasounds that you've had, the chance of them being wrong is even smaller than normal. If you're worried, you could ask the ultrasound tech how sure they think they are of the gender. Sometimes, they don't get a really good look and can be wrong. But if he/she got a really good shot of your baby's &quot;parts&quot;, they are probably right.                 Bailey422    Answered 9/5/07               21 found this helpful     3 ultrasounds + they all say the same thing... there is nothing to fear. If it's bothering you so much you could always go to a 3D ultrasound place +/or post your ultrasound images on websites where people guess/tell you the gender. Google it. :)

Also, keep receipts for any strictly boy stuff you purchase just in case.                 mama_biscuit    Answered 9/6/07               21 found this helpful     I am 34 weeks pregnant.

I wish she would have just said I don't know. but we were seening her just for the sex and I feel like she just had to give us an answer. I feel like I am haveing a boy for some reason. Maybe because I really want one, I don't really know. But in your case I would say get a 3d or 4d if you just can't get past it.

(or vice versa)             Pr3goPrincess    Posted 02/11/2009       Well i was just wondering how often does this REALLY happen? you have an ultrasound and are told your having one and you actually have the other? i guess im just a little worried bc my doctor tries to scare me with all these stories that "oh yeah so and so was told they were having a girl and out pops johnny!" and on and on. when she was getting my papers ready to scheldule my first ultrasound i was really exiited, but she looked right at me and in the meanest voice "THIS IS NOT TO LOOK FOR A PENIS! its to check all of thhe organs!"  of course i kno that but seriously who isnt exited to know the sex of their unborn child?¬† she seamed angry with me bc i wanted to know what i was having and of course i want to make sure everything is ok too! but after that she just kept saying "you know theyre¬†NOT always right!" "Its JUST a GUESS they dont even know!" and a bunch of other stuff :/  so i was just wondering how often does that happen? now im going to be worried for the next 5 months wondering if the ultrasound¬†is going¬†to be¬†wrong :( (sorry so long)     --  ?Megan?

Mine is going to make me wait until my 24th week so that they will have a much better chance of getting the sex correct.

It was almost 7 yrs ago so it was just the regular u/s...not the 3d or 4d that are available now. I also had the Dr. and not a tech so I don't think he was as quite as prorficient.

My sister-in-law had her scan at 20 weeks and was told she was having a boy. Then, at her next ultrasound, they said oh now it's looking like a girl. And yup, Emily is definitely a beautiful 4 month old little girl now!  But look at this ultrasound... how did it look so clearly like a boy and how often does this happen??     --  1st Baby Due 8-22-2017  ‚ô°        See all comments from original poster (13)  Hide all comments from original poster (13)      Load more            Comment            Report this post        2          Comments (64)        / 7                   HistoriaMum    Posted 01/16/2017      Not sure on statistics but my DH  (dear husband) was "supposed" to be a girl üòÇ They had to leave to hospital and go get some non-dresses üòùüòÇ               Reply            Report this comment        5                     Jennalynn822 ¬∑ Original Poster    Posted 01/16/2017       HistoriaMum said:    Not sure on statistics but my DH was "supposed" to be a girl üòÇ They had ...

The answer is always yes and then I ask how long they have been doing it. That way I can subtley ask without being like, "How qualified are you?".  I've had three girls at this point though so in order to convince me this ones a boy I'd have to see his bits from a few different angles. üòÇ               Reply            Report this comment         3                     LilLoveBugs    Posted 01/16/2017      I know 2 people who where told girls and ended up with boys!

I have two boys as well but I am happy either way. I would say you are having a boy but even at 35 weeks they can never be 100% until that baby pops out you won't 100% know.

Not over my baby being a boy or a girl.      I agree. I reallly realllllllly want a boy, but I'd be just as happy with another little girl. Girls are so easy to shop for and have so many different clothing options! Clothing could be considered a blessing and a curse though...... Lol !

Of course after two girls, you have hope for a boy for third. I think it's ok to feel sad for gender. We will get over it and love the baby to the moon and back. We should support each other....we vent here, let it out, and that's it.    But back to your ultrasound, it does look like a boy. My second one was told it was a boy at 15 weeks. Now I look back, that part just like a swollen girl parts.    --  Renee (6/2010), Elizabeth (T21, 11/2011)                     Report this comment        4                     almaa91    Posted 01/21/2015      They told me boy too but I was only 14 weeks a little early to be 100% sure but the tech says it's pretty obvious though I was hoping for a girl too but at the end of the day as long as my baby is healthy that is all I ask for don't matter the gender                       Report this comment        1                     sheaberry    Group Owner  Posted 01/21/2015      That's a boy, for sure.    --  Group Owner, July 2015                     Report this comment        2                     BradnBrandi's Bunch    Posted 01/21/2015     Devastated??

It is possible but unlikely that it could be wrong.

This sometimes happens because the girl parts are swollen. At 16 weeks with a good tech and quality machine the chances of it being wrong are low. I had mine at almost 17 weeks and my tech got a quality gender shot right away and it was pretty obvious it was a girl. Her parts weren't swollen, so it looked pretty flat, but with the three lines.

At 16w I was told boy and she said she saw a clear distinction between the umbillical cord and the "penis." At 21 weeks the tech said that it looked like a girl but that it was hard to tell. At 23 weeks they said the baby was for sure a girl.  I hear a lot that it's common to mistake boys as girls if you can see a penis so what I'm confused about is how this happened? How could they see a penis before and now there isn't one??  Does it happen fairly often that boys turn into girls??

Everything was blue & decorated for a boy, and then a girl came out.¬† This was within the last year.¬† That's the only one I've heard about, but I don't know that many pregnant people, either.    --  H appily married to my best friend, Jamie, since 9/8/07 Expecting our¬†rainbow baby¬†on 8/8/09...Its a GIRL..Riley (needs a middle name)                     Report this comment        5                     Turtle75    Posted 05/04/2009      Hard to say with out seeing the images and with out knowing the experience of the person doing the scan.  Boys and girls start out looking very similar.¬† They both have protrusions. In some cases that protrusion can still be there at 15-16 weeks and can be mistaken for boy parts if the scanner is not careful.¬† That's why I like to penis AND scrotum when I ID a boy.¬† That way I know for sure.  An ultrasound is only as good as the person who does it.¬† It is very if not soley operator dependent.¬† Mistakes can and do happen but most of those mistakes are made when gender ID is attempted too early and/or by someone not properly trained/experienced or qualified.

She said that the 3D place much have gotten a pic of the umbilical cord instead of a penis. My baby was very uncooperative for the doctor's office tech to see all the way till 32 weeks but always commented that she thought that she seen labia but couldn't get a good veiw to correctly predict the gender.

I was shocked because I had this feeling that it was a girl. I already have a 2.5 yr old son and his ultrasound showed a clear turtle head between his legs. This one looks very weird...like when is SUPPOSED to be the scrotum (I see no penis) is shaped like an oval and is out of place.¬† There appears to be other stuff near by so it looks like we're mistaking something else for boy bits.Take a look at my profile and there's a picture called "ultrasound 09." My OB's office claims that the tech is good and I shouldn't worry. But something tells me otherwise...maybe mother intuition??

They had us come in for a 2nd ultrasound because they didn't get a clear view of the umbilical cord. At the 2nd ultrasound at 23 weeks the ultrasound tech said she couldn't say for sure either way but that it could be a girl. The only view we got was from the bum with the legs together. Do you know if a scrotum can look like a vagina? At both ultrasounds I could see how they thought it was a boy and then a girl so I have NO idea.    --  Amy, wife to Chris SAHM to Jack Christopher , 8-25-09, Sydney Rae 04-14-11 and Brooke Rylie 1-23-13!

She had 4 ultrasounds throughout her pregnancy that all said girl, the baby was born this morning and is very definitely a boy  When sonographers get it wrong, is it usually scan says girl/baby is really a boy (as opposed to the other way around?) I'm guessing its pretty rare, I haven't ever known anyone to have this happen before!?   Edited by Two4Me, 03 September 2011 - 06:12 PM.

When I had my last baby I met a lady who had been told she was having a baby girl but ended up delivering a baby boy instead.¬†¬†After the baby was born she said she asked the midwives how 'she' was and said the midwives then looked at her strangely and said 'she'?¬†¬†That was when she found out that the little girl she was expecting was infact a little boy. My best friend decided she would find out the gender of her last (fourth) baby after not having found out with her other 3.¬†¬†She was told several times that she was having a girl, and after 3 boys she was very excited.¬†¬†She ended up having one more scan before giving birth and was then told a boy at this scan.¬†¬†Boy #4 ended up arriving.¬†¬†He was in a breech position up until the last scan so that might have had something to do with it.¬†¬†She regrets trying to find out the gender during the pregnancy and if they had have said boy all along she would have been happier with that. I have a friend who was initially told girl that turned into a boy, but she was initially told a girl during the 1st trimester scan so not very accurate then I guess.     Back to top                #5   Veritas Vinum Arte    Posted 04 September 2011 - 05:08 AM    I had a GF who from the 20wk scan was expecting 'Olivia' and then I was surprised when the txt came to announce the arrival of 'Oliver'. For me my 12wk scan I was told BOY, then at 20wk scan told GIRL and had DD for #3, but that was an early 12wk scan.

I have been told bout 6 or 7 times by 6 different people this one is a girl, i am hoping they are right. i guess i will know in about 5 weeks.      Back to top                #7   Iris37    Posted 04 September 2011 - 07:07 AM    I have heard it can happen (wrong gender prediction from scan)but dont know anyone¬†¬†personally that it has happened to.¬†¬†I only found out the gender of my younger 2 and they got it right.      Back to top                #8   BusyMum2014    Posted 04 September 2011 - 11:51 AM    Yes it 'can' happen but with modern technology, it doesnt happen too often. I have known of this happening to one person, however, she was only given a 70% chance that it was a girl and it turned out a boy. I think sonographers are more likely to be wrong if they determine that a girl is a girl based on a lack of male bits. I think it is meant to be pretty spot on if they see the 3 lines typical of a girl. This was what I was told. I am having a girl and was told 99.9% girl as they clearly saw the 3 lines.     Back to top                #9   mccarro    Posted 04 September 2011 - 12:54 PM    It's much more common for it to be wrong if you get told a girl at the gender scan.There's no denying boy bits as they're pretty clear to see on a scan when the baby makes it obvious, but as PP said the absence of boy bits can very easily get mistaken for a girl, when they simply can't get a good enough look in that area to be sure. I found out with DS, and he bared himself to us, and I'm going to find out again, but unless they can tell me with more than 95% certainty that it's a girl, then I'll assume it still could be either.

Second child, my brother didn't want to know but his partner did. She was told a boy at her 20 week scan. Because my brother didn't want to know, they stuck with buying gender neutral clothes. Lucky because DD2 was born. Third child, they both wanted to know, and had a 3D scan. They were told definitely a boy, but instead DD3 was born. I'm guessing in both cases the umbilical cord was mistaken for a penis. EFS.   Edited by DylMah, 04 September 2011 - 04:27 PM.

My mum still believes it's a girl, so asked DH if he still wanted to bet, which he's now accepted!¬†¬†Hahaha...¬†¬†He just feels bad about taking $100 off my mum, but we'll see who's right when bub is born! So we have to start thinking of boys names because we don't have any boys names we like.¬†¬†If bub turns out to be a girl, we already have girls names sorted out at least.¬†¬†Also not so bad dressing a girl in blue clothes than dressing a boy in pink clothes, not that it matters when they're newborns anyway!

The midwife was slightly prone to exaggeration but she'd been looking after a girl who, days after the birth, was rejecting the baby for being the wrong sex, so... We're pretty definite on our little bundle - the only thing bubs would sit still for long enough to let us see at 28 weeks was her privates (lol) and they were clear.

So the question - to those that have been told girl - did they actually SHOW you anything?¬†¬†Im assuming there isnt much to see!¬†¬†But thought Id find out from a group of people whether this is the norm for a girl as we are in unchartered territory..

I would definately get them to check at your next scan just to put your mind at ease, I really hope they were right.

Back to top                #4   amicrazy    Posted 14 March 2008 - 06:51 AM    We were also shown the 3 white lines in teh ultrasound. If¬†¬†they are going off teh lack of boy bits, them i would try and have it confirmed again.      Back to top                #5   mumsthe1    Posted 14 March 2008 - 06:55 AM    No ultrasound is 100% even 3d/4d. These was a thread about this last week in the what do you think? thread about being told 100% it was a girl, the op had washed everything and set up the baby room all girly only to give birth to a boy. I was told a girl also, the sono told me that she couldn't see any dangly bits either but she said that she wasn't comfortable for us to go out and buy pink just yet. If you want to buy pink,¬†¬†I would keep all tags on and make sure you have some neutral item just in case it turns out to be a boy.      Back to top                #6   BugBiEz    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:26 AM    I had a girl first, my sonographer didn't show me anything she just told me shes been doing this for a long time and she was 95% sure she was a girl... She got it right but I didn't buy anything pink till I had another scan at 25 weeks. She was right! I had a healthy 8lb girl       Back to top                #7   Nics    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:25 AM    Thanks to the replies so far... FWIW I dont mind if it is a boy....¬†¬†after all its what Im used to!¬†¬†I was just worried that I wasnt actually "shown" anything (ie the 3 lines) so not sure how good a guess it really was.... and if I should start planning for a pink one! Well looks like Ill have to wait another 9 weeks and see what the prediction is then - if they say girl again Ill believe it however if they say boy ill take all things pink back to the shops  Thinking about it - the sonograopher was pretty thorough (the u/s took 1 1/2 hours to complete!) so Im assuming if there was anything to see she would have seen it and showed us!!¬†¬†She was probably sick of looking at the same baby after that length of time!      Back to top                #8   LovingMyGirls    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:40 AM    I have 2 daughters and found out the sex for both of them (at a number of u/sounds).¬†¬†Girl bits can definately be seen on ultrasound but it could just be the way the sonographer chose to tell you.¬†¬†They can always make mistakes but I think would feel pretty certain to tell someone the sex.      Back to top                #9  Guest_Jamiesmummy_*   Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:48 AM    They usually will say they cant tell if they dont know, we wanted to find out with all of ours and with my fourth bub they told me they couldnt tell as she had her legs crossed and was very modest, lol. She didnt want to show her bits. So cute. At a later scan they showed us what they nicely termed the hamburger, the three lines. lol.     Back to top                #10   Princess.cranky.pants    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:53 AM    We were told DD was a girl but didn't get shown anything. Sometimes they assume it's a girl when they can't see any boy bits. Also keep in mind that 3D scans can be wrong too. The person that was told girl and had a boy, had a 3D gender determination scan. We never believed we were really having a girl till she was born. If I had boys first I would be even less inclined to believe it. I didn't do a pink nursery or buy everything pink.      Back to top                #11   lovemy3    Posted 14 March 2008 - 07:55 AM    It's so frustrating isn't it when you don't know just how sure they were? The same thing happened to me with DS. She didn't actually come right our and say you're definately having a boy. We saw the bits, but I wondered whether because I was hoping for a little boy I'd just imagined it.  After going out straight after the u-sound and buying blue stuff, I actually rang up the radiology place and asked to speak to the lady who had done my u-sound. I explained to her my predicament and asked if she could remember. Her reply was "It was most definately a boy, there was penis and testicles everywhere I looked!!" I felt a bit more confident then! Good luck to you!     Back to top                #12   cremello    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:03 AM    We could see three distinct white lines with my DD at 19 weeks, I wouldn't trust a sex prediction based on her not being able to see any external genitalia. Then again I still didn't trust my US, or even the 4D one until I had her in my arms. Still bought lots of pink but terrified she would be blue not pink!      Back to top                #13   jessf    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:05 AM    With my first they didn't "show" us anything on the u/s the sonographer just said "and there's it's girly bits" and went straight to another part of the body and I had to stop her and say "are we having a girl?" and she just said "yes" and as you can see by my sig- we have a happy and healthy 1 year old girl! Good luck (although I agree- I didn't take tags off anything and just washed the "both-gender" items!)      Back to top                #14   Cantankerous    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:11 AM    I was told girl at 20 weeks. He was pretty sure but didnt show us anything and I was over the moon and brought all pink things. Then I had another quick scan a week ago after leaking fluid and I asked her to check again. She quickly did and showed me the 3 lines and said I'm pretty sure of a girl but I'm not with 100% because we are simply not allowed to say 100%. First guy told us 80% girl Its a whole lot better than DS one. 51% chance of boy, gee thanks what was the point of even telling me that!      Back to top                #15   natcul    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:20 AM    We were told at our 20 week ultrasound 60% girl.¬†¬†They didnt show me any bits. I had a 4D ultrasound at 36 weeks and we were told again that its a girl. I havent gone overboard buying the pink stuff.¬†¬†Ive only bought a few girlie bits and pieces that can be returned.¬†¬†Nursery is pretty neutral. You never really know until its born i guess!!!      Back to top                #16   woopsadaisy    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:40 AM    I find it a bit odd to say without dangly bits it must be a girl, our sonographer was very clear with us, and showed us the 3 white lines, indicating girl - and she was (is!). In fact when I questioned how accurate his reading was I was told in no uncertain terms, "it's a GIRL!" This time around it was SO obviously a boy the sonographer just said,'Well what do you think?'      Back to top                #17   Eizzor    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:50 AM    We seen this (|) clearly on the ultrasound....the three lines.      Back to top                #18   Moonlitdreams    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:52 AM    My bub was spread eagle and the sonographer said 'there isn't anything in between and if it were a boy, there would be by now. I asked her about the 3 lines and that I heard people were shown the formation of the girly bits and she told me it's really a matter of 'is it there or is it not' I don't know if I was happy with that answer considering so many people are shown the bits. I have bought 5 items pink and everything else nuetral but it's so hard these days as everything is blue or pink.       Back to top                #19   PinkyBlue    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:55 AM    You would be suprised how easier it is to see a girl over a boy. DD was dead easy without the sonographer telling us at first...3 lines like a hamburger and even ovaries...it took me awhile to work out DS..I couldnt guess at first.      Back to top                #20   clumpy    Posted 14 March 2008 - 08:58 AM    QUOTE So the question - to those that have been told girl - did they actually SHOW you anything? Im assuming there isnt much to see! Well there is, it's just a different shape! (The way some people talk about there being 'nothing there' you'd think females didn't have genitals...) The hamburger is the labia, vagina and sometimes the clitoris depending what angle they're at. Because of complications I had 4 scans and each time they said it was 99.5% likely to be a girl, and showed us. It was pretty clear, but I still left the tags on even vaguely gender-specific clothing.      Back to top                #21   **Xena**    Posted 14 March 2008 - 10:03 AM    I have also been told girl after two boys and still don't really believe it! Luckily a friend had given us all her pink baby stuff and I already have blue baby stuff so I have decided to just play wait and see. The sonographer also just used the "can't see any dangly bits" line and I was so shocked after two boys that I just forgot to ask if he saw the lines. Bubs legs were wide open so I don't know if he used those terms for my benefit or if he didn't look for labia etc! However before he had told me the sex I thought I had seen 3 lines so I guess I will find out at the end of May. I have bought some beautiful neutral bedlinen just in case    Edited by 1~plus~2, 14 March 2008 - 01:40 PM.

He pointed out that he couldn't see any boy bits, and could see the umbilical cord clearly, and he could make out the 3 white lines and after he said "I would put money on a girl" That still isn't 100% for me, so I am keeping my mind open to the possibility it could be a boy.. just in case.

I could also tell that our last DS was a boy - I knew before they told us, I guess I knew what I was looking for But I could not tell with this one, so I am pretty sure they are right. I have only bought some pink blankets and a few grow suits.¬†¬†Everything else pink has been given to me.¬†¬†I still have all the boy stuff though - just in case.

So my questions is how many mothers out here that have been told it's a girl but it actually turned out to be a boy. And how much is the chances that U/S gets wrong? TIA     Back to top                #2   ~JJs~    Posted 18 July 2007 - 09:12 PM    Not really sure of the actual percentage. I was told at my 12 week scan with my Ob he thought it was a boy, but when we found out at 19 weeks the scan said a girl. We chose to go with what the 19 scan said.

I think with girl predictions you have to still remain open minded cause there seems to be more slip ups with these ones. We had our 19 - 20wks scan yesterday & at the last moment I asked the sonographer to double check the gender for us; yep 100% a boy (daddy is going to be so proud of him).

Pumpkin Patch are evil geniuses; their clothes are so beautiful and they have sales! Our sonographer said 'strong chance' its a girl. I saw three white lines, and I have felt strongly from the word go that this one is a girl. I'll be totally shocked if its a boy; not because I don't want another boy - I do, but because I feel so strongly that this is a girl...

I saw the 3 white lines and thats all that matters to me, thats what led the sonographer to say girl too because of those pretty white lines.

At my 17wk scan my OB did a quick scan of the gender for us & he was only 50% sure it was a boy (yep three white lines in the picture too) anyway, yesterday it was confirmed we are 100% having another baby boy (no more three white lines just a big willie. haha).

Marisa - I was shown those 3 white lines as reassurance at my u/s too. I have never known anyone who was told the wrong sex during an u/s, I guess it depends how trained the sonographer is etc.¬†¬†I made the sonographer check 3 times.

I know they are usually not 100% sure but friends and family have been told 80% not 60-70%.

I'm hoping that they'll be able to tell me in 2 weeks at my 19 week scan. Are you able to get another scan done that might be able to give you a more definite answer?

There are companies that do non-medical scans later in pregnancy where you can have another try. They're often not cheap, you can't claim any of it on Medicare or health insurance, and obviously bubs isn't always compliant but if you're keen to find out it's an option. Some of them let you come back if you don't see the sex the first time. A lot of them are the 3D/4D scans which is also very cool.

Sorry, I should have mentioned that in my original post. priscilla01 - Wow, you have 4 girls and you're pregnant again?¬†¬†I've got 1 DD and this is my second.¬†¬†We plan to have 3 children so I know I'll have another.¬†¬†Deep down I probably was hoping for a boy, but hey, as long as bub is healthy that is the main thing.¬†¬†A little sister for Mikayla is also lovely!! luckymum - Yeah I think that is why the sonographer said girl because she couldn't see any boy bits.¬†¬†She did seem a little young so maybe she doesn't have that much experience.¬†¬†I was a little upset that she didn't take much time to look.¬†¬†She made sure the baby was ok and healthy and said ok we're done.¬†¬†I said what about the sex of the baby, I'd like to find out.¬†¬†My DH left the room and she had a look for all of 2 mins.¬†¬†My DH said he thinks it's a boy because of how quick I was, he said it must have been really obvious to her Wow your cousin got told girl and had a boy, what a surprise that must have been. ~FƒπoWe¬Æ T√µT~ - Lucky you have have it confirmed!!¬†¬†So what are you having LOL!!! 3walk1fly - I wish I did have pics because I'd post them on here for you girls to give me your opinions I didn't get any pics because DH doesn't want to know, I was scared he'd find them.¬†¬†Yeah, 60-70% chance is very frustrating, I would have rathered her say she couldn't tell. -Hannahmania- - Hi Sharon!! Congrats on your little boy!!¬†¬†I'll update you when I have my scan with the OB in 2 weeks. littlesuzie - Yeah it is worse being told there is a 60-70% chance.¬†¬†I'll have another scan in 2 weeks!! MumtoBandD - I think it's harder for them to determine it if's a girl than it is a boy. Congrats on your little girl!     Back to top                #9   rach81    Posted 12 July 2007 - 07:47 PM    I was told at the 18 week scan, "looks" like a girl. Wasnt enough to entirely convince me. At 34 week scan even though there was a foot wedged right in the way, the sonographer said she couldnt see any boy bits and would actually bet money on it being a girl. Still wasnt enough to convince me completely and lucky that she didnt bet any money as last Wednesday, gave birth to a beautiful baby boy!

Second girl I told DH I am still getting my boy Third girl I said there's gotta be hope for me Fourth girl I said bloody hell. This pregnancy I said I'm outter here if it's another girl.. DH has never really wanted a boy from day one..Me how ever am desperate for a mummies boy.. I will be truely heart broken if I never get my boy... Can't be helped but and this is it for us.. DH says, I gave u 4 girls what more do you want..

Luckily they said at the end - "but I wouldn't be painting the room pink just yet" so I checked with my ob and he said def a boy - he had known for ages just didn't know I wanted to know so hadn't said anything       Back to top                #12  Guest_LittleMissL_*   Posted 12 July 2007 - 10:28 PM    I was also told 70% chance that we were having a girl.

DH and I want to find out with ours, but I think what we will do is tell the Sonographer that we want to know, but only if they are 80%-90% sure... any less than that I think I would rather not know. Although we would be happy with anything (this pregnancy has been 5 years coming and is an IVF baby), I think i would struggle with finding out on ultrasound it is a girl, then giving birth to a boy, and vice versa.... so I think i would¬†¬†really want more than 70% sure if you knwo what I mean.     Back to top                #14   howdoyoudoit    Posted 13 July 2007 - 12:08 PM    I would be getting another scan or sticking with neutral colours with that %. We are preg apparently with a girl nd was told 90% but I still dont believe it fully...lol..well enough to go mad on clothes buying but tags are still on them!...lol... a friend got told a girl twice as there were no boy bits there and once born it was def. a HE.... and yes she had gone mad on pink aswell!... Im off for another scan in 2 weeks to make sure she is a she..      Back to top                #15   mikaylas-mum    Posted 13 July 2007 - 04:48 PM    Thanks for all of your replies!!¬†¬†So many different experiences.¬†¬†I can't believe how common it is for people to be told girl and then go on to have a boy. I was feeling a little today about the professionalism of the sonographer yesterday.¬†¬†She didn't really give me re-assurance that the baby was healthy until I asked at the end, didn't tell me the heart rate and didn't tell me that my due date is slightly ahead. I realised that the date had changed when I was watching the dvd last night . Not to mention the uncertainty of the sex. Today I went to Medicare and claimed for the $250 fee I paid yeterday, I only got $80 back.¬†¬†When I got home I called head office and complianed about the sonographer.¬†¬†The person I spoke to said she should have told me she couldn't give me a definate answer and left it at that.¬†¬†So, after all that I've booked in for a complimentary ultrasound on Monday at 10:40am.¬†¬†I'll be back in around lunch time on Monday to update you all, hopfully I'll get a more definate boy/ girl answer and the assurance that my baby is perfectly healthy  suzi1973 - I know what you mean about not being sure, I suppose for you there is that 10% chance it could be a boy..lol.¬†¬†I was shopping today and was tempted to buy a cute pink jumpsuit but didn't due to the uncertainty.¬†¬†Wow, your friend must have been shocked when she gave birth to a boy.¬†¬†I hope you get confirmaion at your scan in 2 weeks!! mumma~soon - Great idea to tell the sonographer you only want to know if he/she is 80/90% sure.¬†¬†I wish I would have done that yesterday. I'm glad I have a repeat scan on Monday, just so I know either way.¬†¬†It's funny, if she would have told me there was no way she could be certain I would have left it at that.¬†¬†I've now got this uncertainty in my mind and must find out, it's driving me crazy!! LittleMissL - I've got a strong feeling it is a girl, but the 60-70% thing gives me doubts. patricks_ma - Wow, so I could still be carrying a boy..I'll soon know on Monday!!     Back to top                #16   4forme    Posted 13 July 2007 - 08:52 PM    A my 18 week scan I was told 80% boy, and since I'd never been told in a percentage before I soemtimes wonder if I really am having a boy. Sometimes I correct myself and think i must be though as my sonographer marked on the dvd 'xy' where she pointed out the supposed boy bits, so I figure maybe it's right for her to do that. Not long to wait and see for sure, but gee it can be frustrating.

My cousin has 2 girls and is due any day now with a boy.. my mom had 2 boys then had me.. a friend of mine has 2 girls and just had a boy a couple months ago... So that theory is dead to me, lol.

I just had an ultrasound ¬†at 12 weeks and the doctor said he thinks it's a boy. My heart broke a little cuz we already have a boy, and I'm 40 yrs old. There's no way I'm going for a 3rd time.

One blessing with the same sex children is the friendship they will have growing up and in adulthood - each child is individual and my two girls are nothing alike and I have now doubt if I have number 3 girl she will also be her own person and not like either of my other two...

I think 12-13 weeks is just a guess, they are so small it's hard to see b  babyearfras I know someone who was told girl at 20 weeks and then nope here's your baby boy. Save to say there's always a chance it's wrong even later one in pregnancy E  EmerysMom @aajohnson92  At 12w5d we were told Boy at our NT scan. Tech said 70%. At 16w4d private scan baby is ALL girl. Legs were wide open and very clear. h  helloufo @aajohnson92  on92 at our 12 week 3 day ultrasound we were given a 70% chance of a boy. 3 weeks later blood work came back and it was 100% a girl. We also saw her lady bits at a 17 week ultrasound and they looked completely different than the 12 week one. It definitely went from an outtie to a hamburger. S  StacyandSam we were told boy at 12w then girl at 18w. It can definitely happen m  mdfultz I'll let you know tomorrow. I was told boy at 12 weeks but I have doubts since it was so early. We go tomorrow for our anatomy scan so we'll find out for sure then! j  jkerr1012 We were told boy at almost 15 weeks and then told girl at 18 weeks. I didn't see any boy parts at the 15 scan so I was a little too nervous to start buying boy stuff. On the 18 weeks scan, you could see as clear as day that there were absolutely no boy parts there! B  BumpItUp @aajohnson92  Yep!! Not my but my friend. e  erinkay75 13 weeks is too early to be told anything unless via blood draw. This is one of those things that just makes my blood boil! The penis and vagina look very similar up until about 18 weeks. While there have been people who have been given the right gender early via scan, it's more of a coincidence that it was correct. Either way, just remember how blessed you are to be carrying this child. S  Serenawsu For sure. ¬†Our 13 week scan they told us it was a girl, but that early it is only about 70% right according to our technician. 4  4toolove @helloufo  I had blood work too and they told me I'm having a girl.

I already bought her a few cute clothes (can't take them back because they were on sale) but I'm not going to go overboard on clothes just in case and I know she'll grow out of them. Plus I'll probably get tons at my baby shower o  onedayforchar My friend was told a boy. Had a girl. This was around 15 years ago though. k  kerryatkin This is 100% a girl! Boys are soooooo easy to tell you could see my friends little boys willy on the scan at 13 weeks and I got told at 13 weeks mine was a girl! I'll see if I can upload a pic to show u the boy, your certainly having a girl she wouldn't miss a willy on the scan, there not allowed to say 100% what it is that's why she's said if it was a boy, mine was the same G  GlamMomof3FL @LittleLady2015  With my last pregnancy I was told girl at my anatomy scan. I went in for another ultrasound one week before I delivered and sure enough it was a little BOY!!!! Talk about surprise of a lifetime! This was 6 years ago. a  alphabeth This happened to my therapist about 18 years ago. I was told girl through the Cell Free DNA test, and also that it's 99% accurate, but I've been worried ever since that I'm in that 1%! I want to get confirmation through an ultrasound before I buy anything. Hopefully with two methods of sex determination I'll feel more comfortable. In addition to finding what *isn't* there -- y chromosome, penis -- there should be three lines on an ultrasound that indicate girl. The anatomy scan is detailed and also will examine baby's genitalia¬†along with everything else. L  LittleLady2015 Thanks everyone! j  jensmith328 My sister was told girl at 16 weeks. He was a boy two weeks later at the anatomy scan. k  kristi7420 Just Wait until your March 2nd¬†ultrasound which is probably your Anatomy Scan. The Anatomy scan the baby is developed enough for a clear gender. Yes you can see if it's a boy or girl at 16 weeks but if you want to be sure wait to buy anything until the Anatomy scan ultrasound. Because right now is not a for Sure gender. There are still plenty of things you can buy without gender, like the crib, dresser, hangers, breast feeding clothes or supplies for you, etc. Here is my Anatomy Scan ultrasound which clearly shows what I am having. ;-) p  piperchapman Not me, but I have 2 friends that were told girl at 15 and 16 weeks and both had boys. One was born last year and the other 3 years ago, so pretty recent. h  hannah_gabrielle This happened to my half sister! Her mother was told she was having a boy and it was a girl. Obviously :) lol This was almost 17 years ago though so the chances of making a mistake like that are probably much slimmer. At least I would hope so! :| h  haleyanne01 My friend this year was told 100% girl at her 18 week anatomy, delivered a boy. It was shocker that's forsure! K  KAS0821 @LittleLady2015  Last may we threw a shower for our friends who were having a girl due at the end of June. She received everything pink. One week later and about a month before her due date they saw a penis on the ultrasound. She delivered a boy three weeks later K  KAS0821 @kerryatkin  This is simply untrue. Of course they can miss the penis on a scan!!!!! j  jaydengreen @LittleLady2015  Definitely had a huge girl baby shower and name picked out for a boy. m  mommabear2323 Yes, sadly for me at 16 weeks I was told by 2 techs it was definitely all girl.. went back for gender u/s and was told boy instead with clear view of boy parts. This will be my second boy. Good luck! b  blessedmommy_2015 This happened to my SIL and her son will be 16! She has me so paranoid because I am falling in love with my daughter and I just want her healthy and alive! Nothing more or less.... T  TinyDancer611 @LittleLady2015  You mention that they saw nothing, but did they see the three lines indicative of a girl? If not, there's still a chance that you could be having a boy. They likely wouldn't tell you because they truly weren't sure at that point. g  ghedrick On Friday of last week, the L&D dr said it might definitely be a girl. On Monday the ultrasound tech said boy with obvious visuals, so it can happen. Get gift receipts for everything....cause you'll only know for sure when baby is born. t  tam0718 My son is almost two now. But at 14 weeks and 16 weeks we where told girl because of three flat lines. I asked for the head Sono tech Joe, the teacher.he came in went over my sono again at 16 weeks and ask.was we told what we were having I said yes a girl.. He was like no your having a BOY..penis hadn't dropped but his scrotum was there. I clearly couldn't see he said you have to have a trained eye. He doesn't recommend giving gender results before 20 weeks. Because baby still growing and things can be swollen.

I'm a FTM and was told around 13 weeks we were having a boy and 20 week anatomy scan would confirm. We spent the next seven weeks buying clothes, naming him, referring to the baby as him, as Colton (the name we chose) and our son and became over the moon for a little boy. At the 20 week anatomy scan, the tech said "oh looks like a healthy baby girl, 99.9% sure!!" We still love our daughter just as much but are in a way grieving the little baby boy we never had but we had convinced ourselves we were bonding with. My SO was so excited for a little boy to taking fishing and hunting and all things little boys do with their daddy's. Not to say he doesn't love the baby girl we are expecting, but over the last almost two months we in a way built a life in our head with a boy. It has only been 3 days since we found out so we are slowly adjusting. I returned all my boy clothes I bought and exchanged them for girl ones. I am definitely loving the thought of a daughter but I am still adjusting. This may all sound kind of dramatic but I am new at this and was kind of crushed when we were told something we didn't see coming. But like I said, we are coming around and love her just as much :) for your sanity don't assume she is right until you have a clear clear picture of the baby's goods! I don't want you to do what I did!

K  Kessy08 The lady at my 12.5 week appointment told us she is pretty sure it's a boy. I told my husband though not to get too excited yet and to wait till I am further along. I will find out Saturday if the lady was right or not (I will be 19 weeks then). G  GwenKlackers at our 12 week scan we were told there was an 80% chance that it was a boy. When we went for our 16 week scan, which was done in 3D, doc said nope - it's 100% a girl... :) so yes i think 12 weeks is too early to confirm gender, based only my personal experience. l  lexlove33 Told girl at 13 weeks confirmed girl at 21 weeks!!!! Very obvious was a girl from 13 weeks :p I'm a believer in early scans p  preggolily14 I mentioned at my 13 week appointment how excited we were to find out and how I was tempted to get an elective US to find out the sex since we couldn't wait until our next appointment. My doctor scoffed and said it was a waste of money and they only promise a 50% accuracy. She said "flip a coin and save yourself the money". So, needless to say, we waited until our next appointment (little over 19 weeks) and used the money on a date night instead. C  CarmenAL Told us boy at 12 w and 2 days. These photos were done then.

It's just going to be very, VERY hard to handle. No boy name picked out, no boy ANYTHING ready, and I've been dreaming of this little girl since I found out she was a she! Of course, I'll love him, but after 8 months of imagining and talking to one gender, it's going to be strange! Reply  Close r  routhd This is why I have been team green for all pregnancies. I had a family member who thought she was having a boy, had the name picked out since the first ultrasound, nursery decorated. When baby came out and was a girl, she grieved as though she had lost her boy. It was quite sad to see her reaction. But she obviously snapped out of it quickly enough bc all that mattered was that baby was healthy. Reply  Close d  dsomerbreeze Happened to me twice. Once 14 years ago and this pregnancy.

But Then Something Unexpected Happened by Catherine Donaldson-Evans Updated: March 10, 2015 It was the big day -- the day my husband and I would find out whether our first child was a boy or a girl. I had a sneaking suspicion I already knew. Call it maternal instinct or just a feeling I had, but I was pretty sure. My husband had the same hunch. Still, this simple gender test would be the proof. In some ways, I couldn't believe we were actually going through with this. Before I'd even met my husband, let alone gotten pregnant, I always thought I'd want to my baby's sex to be a surprise. I had fantasies of going through the nine months blissfully in the dark about what I was having until that moment in the delivery room when my doctor would announce triumphantly, "It's a boy!" or "It's a girl!" I love surprises, especially happy ones. My husband, on the other hand, does not love surprises. He kind of hates them, especially when he's on the receiving end. It would have been stressful for him to go through the entire pregnancy not knowing our baby's gender when the information was right there at our fingertips. So I didn't even try to fight it. I knew it was more important to him to find out than it was for me to be surprised. And there's still some element of mystery in learning halfway through, anyway. MORE:   8 Beautiful Baby Names We Ultimately Rejected  So there we were, in my doctor's office. My stomach was glistening with sonogram gel and my OB was moving the wand around so we could see just what kind of baby I was carrying. She zoomed in on one small square of the screen and held it there. I caught my breath, squinting at the blurry, fuzzy, black-and-white blob in front of me. "You want to know the sex, right?" she asked, stating the obvious. "Yes," we said in unison. "Well, it looks like it's a boy!" the doctor said cheerfully. There was a stunned minute-long silence. A ... boy? No. It couldn't be. I'd been so sure I was carrying a girl. I just knew it was a girl. My husband was thinking the same thing. Both of us were a tiny bit let-down. Finally, I spoke. "A boy?" I asked, incredulous. "Really? Could you show us what you're seeing? I've had a strong feeling the baby is a girl." "Sure," she replied, as if this happened all the time. She swirled the ultrasound wand around again and then zeroed in on a small section of the image. "See that little 'tinkling' there between the legs? That's the baby's penis." I had no idea what she was seeing, and I bit my lip to keep from giggling in spite of myself. Tinkling between the legs? I stole a glance at my husband. He looked like he was trying hard to keep a straight face too. And then something completely bizarre happened. My doctor did an about-face. "Wait a minute," she said, narrowing her eyes and taking off her glasses. "Hmm." "What?!" my husband blurted out. "Well, on second glance, that might just be the umbilical cord," she said distractedly, still peering intently at the sonogram image. "So I guess it could be a girl." Aha! So there was a chance! Maybe we weren't imagining those gut feelings we had after all ... "Is there a way to tell now for sure?" I asked. She tried to get the baby to move around some more in there so she could better see what that tinkling really was. But our firstborn was having none of it. He/she/it was comfortable and not budging. "Sorry about that, but you'll just have to wait for the amnio results to come back," the OB said. (I'd decided to have amniocentesis because I was over 35, just to be absolutely sure the baby was okay; an added benefit of the test is that it tells you the sex of the child with complete accuracy.) I'd heard about this sort of thing happening to other expectant moms and dads whose gender tests came out wrong at first, so they believed their baby was one gender, only to learn later that it was the other. I'd even heard of those who didn't find out the truth until the actual birth, after having gotten all this boy baby gear when it was really a girl. I never imagined that I would become one of those mixed-up-gender-test parents myself. So we did the only thing we could do. We waited. And waited. And waited. Looking back, it was a great test of my patience, which was high to begin with -- but needed to be even higher when I became a mom. And it was another one of those things that blindsides you in pregnancy and parenthood, the experiences that teach you the element of surprise is par for the course with children. Then, finally, we got the call. The amnio results were in. My doctor rattled off the good news about all the disorders the baby tested negative for. And then, at long last, she told me what I was having, in that absent-minded way she sometimes has. "Refresh my memory -- you already knew you were having a girl, right?" she asked. It's a girl! I whooped with joy, my heart soaring. My husband broke into a big grin. We were having a girl! Our inkling had been right! SEE ALSO: 19 Nature-Inspired Baby Names in Honor of Spring  Would we have gotten used to the idea of having a boy (which we did, two years later) and been just as happy about him? Of course. We would have gone with the flow, like we did with this false gender test and like we have countless times since our children were born. But there's something to be said about trusting your instincts, especially those powerful maternal ones. Sometimes they're more on the mark than all the tests and diagnoses in the world.

Ultrasound can be¬†wrong     Getty Images    (CNN) For expecting parents, 20 weeks is a milestone. It marks the halfway point of the 40 week pregnancy, but most excitingly it is the time many soon-to-be moms and dads find out the answer to the big question: boy or girl?  But what happens when instead of the little girl everyone has been expecting and buying clothes for a little boy ends up being born? Kyle and Danielle Williams captured their family‚Äôs reaction on camera, and their reactions went viral.  How likely is this mix up? ‚ÄúIt depends on how the baby is situated in the uterus,‚Äù said sonographer Catherine E. Rienzo, a fellow with the Society of Diagnostic Medical Sonography. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs not that easy. Size of the uterus, abdominal scars, position of the baby and other factors that can play into it. If it‚Äôs a male and the testicles haven‚Äôt descended, it can look like a female. It‚Äôs not 100%.‚Äù  Making the wrong call happens more frequently than we realize, perhaps as high as one out of ten times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that uncommon to have gender wrong,‚Äù said Dr. John Williams III, Director of Reproductive Genetics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a screening tech. They can‚Äôt make a guarantee of that. ‚Äù  In addition, in recent years, more and more women are getting cell-free fetal DNA tests that are done to screen for genetic disorders like Trisomy 18 and Downs Syndrome, but can also determine gender. These tests are a simple blood draw, done around the ten week mark that can measure fetal DNA particles that make their way into the mother‚Äôs blood. The tests are usually performed on women who are considered to be high-risk pregnancies. But Dr. Williams reiterated that these tests are not diagnostic.  Overall, Williams said that the screening methods are fairly satisfying. ‚ÄúCell-free DNA is probably 95% plus correct and ultrasound depends on who‚Äôs doing it. But if it‚Äôs done by a skilled person‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs 90% to 95% certainty on gender.‚Äù  Pregnancy and birth control by the numbers  In fact, gender determination isn‚Äôt the only thing surrounding fertility that isn‚Äôt precise. Despite everyone‚Äôs concerns about effectiveness, birth control methods can have a range of success rates. According to the Centers for Disease Control, intrauterine devices have a failure rate of between 0.2% and 0.8%, whereas hormonal methods like the traditional pill are effective about 9 out of 10 times. Barrier methods like condoms are in fact some of the least effective methods according to the CDC with a failure rate of 18%.  And if you do become pregnant, how accurate are your typical drugstore pregnancy tests? ‚ÄúOverall, they are pretty certain,‚Äù said Williams. But, he still warns that their accuracy depends on human error. ‚ÄúThere are false positives, false negatives. They frequently depend on the first morning urine, but if the patient has been drinking a lot of liquid ‚Äî it could dilute the hormone. And if it‚Äôs too low on the urine test, it will be a false positive. Things happen.‚Äù But he adds that today‚Äôs tests are more sensitive than they were 30 years ago, when they first came on the market.  Is anything certain?  So when it comes to pregnancy, is anything certain? At least when it comes to gender identification, the only way to be certain according to both Dr. Williams and Riezno is to do Chornic Villi Sampling, known as CVS, and having an amniocentesis done. ‚ÄúThe only way to do it ‚Äî is to do a diagnostic, with 99.9% certainty,‚Äù said Dr. Williams. In these tests, cells are harvested from the placenta or the amniotic sac itself, and are then cultured to sequence the chromosomes. While much more invasive, it is also much more precise.  But these tests are not done just for gender identification. ‚ÄúPhysicians would not do those scans just for that. They are looking for general abnormalities,‚Äù said Rienzo.  So, has Rienzo ever made a mistake in her 35 year career? ‚ÄúI have made a mistake one time,‚Äù she said, 18 years ago. ‚ÄúI did it on a friend of mine. She already had a girl, and I said that she was having another girl. And she actually had a boy. Obviously in the past 18 years, the technology and machines has improved. But yes, I made that mistake.‚Äù    Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network , Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

Has this happened to anyone?    We were told boy at 21 weeks and potty shot defo looked boy, just wondering how often this has happened and it turned out to be girl.

Especially being told boy when it's a girl. The cord can get mistaken for the penis.  That's why a lot of hospitals no longer tell you the sex of the baby.

So the pram soon returned lol. I have never found out because of this reason no cause for error. But saying that with my triplets i kept dreaming i had 2 boys and girl even though i knew that was impossible as mine were identical and would all be the same sex and i had all boys.

My boyfriend, however, is a twin and despite having two ultrasound scans, they thought there was only one baby - big surprise when his brother popped out after him!

But when my mum was pregnant with me and my twin brother, they asked if the babies were the same sex and each time they said yes, two of the same, they didn't want to know if we were two boys or two girls though. They were shocked but very happy when I arrived after my brother, they already had three boys and when he arrived expected a fifth. That was 19 years ago now though and I'm sure scans are much better.

I am having my 2nd boy and altho I would be gutted if I was having a girl now as I've kind off bonded with my boy already I would still love my baby no matter what so to be honest yes it's a pain thinking ur going to have a son/daughter and buying a certain sex clothes but as long as they are healthy I don't see why it matters lol. And yeh sonographers will always say they cannot say 100% this is for the reason that a boy could be a late developer so u think it's a girl or a girl could have the cord between her legs and be mistaken for a boy X          Reply With Quote             15-05-16, 21:57    #17        Maggie M(112)    View Profile    View Forum Posts       Member         Join Date  Jan 2016  Location  Oakley  Posts  2,677          my friend got told boy and had a girl. shes nearly 14 now and I can see why they might have been confused  people say all the time that my baby ended up in my friends body because her daughter is so like me (total petrol head, tomboy ladette) and her mums such a girly girl pretty pink princess          Reply With Quote             16-05-16, 08:38    #18           Daisy G(195)    View Profile    View Forum Posts       Member         Join Date  Jan 2016  Posts  176          I work in theatres and I watched my first c section the other day, they expected a girl and popped out a boy!

Thanks!       Add message | Report    theborrower   Thu 10-Mar-11 16:14:53    Scans aren't always accurate, so there's always the possibility she made a mistake. A friend of a friend was also told that she was having a boy and out popped a girl. So it does happen...       Add message | Report     nicolamumof3    Thu 10-Mar-11 16:17:30    I think its more likely the other way round tho. all our boys 'bits' were quite unmistakable! I have three and was told last week that no.4 is a girl but im not convinced despite all the pink i've started buying!!       Add message | Report    rasta   Thu 10-Mar-11 16:18:10    It can happen from time to time. Did the sonographer get a good look or just a glimpse? At 20 weeks it's pretty clear to see pink or blue if they have a cooperative baby.

She had been told by the sonographers that she was having a boy, so they can and do get it wrong. It was clearly quite difficult for the lady - she was Somali I think, and already had a daughter and I heard her several times on her phone apologising to her husband that it was another girl and asking him to come and visit them and he wouldn't. They hadn't named the baby either       Add message | Report     StrawberriesAndScream    Thu 10-Mar-11 17:52:30    Message withdrawn at poster's request.

All the stress of thinking she was having a boy and then having a girl would of been hard enough to deal with if it really was that important in your family! And it's him that determined the sex of the baby so why do they put it all on the women! If anyone should be shamed in that family it should be him!!! But to be honest, it should be a fantastic time for a family to receive a new little one! Oh the poor girl!!! Similar though, this is my third and I'm really hoping for a boy as I have two girls, but to be honest, as long as baby is healthy, girly clothes shopping is soooo much fun!!

At my proper scan at 18w3d it was clear she was all girl! 20 weeks should be more reliable than 16, but mistakes can and do happen.

It WAS a girl!

And my pg has been really really different too. NEver ever felt so sick and nauseous still every day and im almost 22w       Add message | Report    MerryMarigold   Thu 10-Mar-11 22:11:22    I think you are my friend! She's in exactly this situation. But she is accepting that it's a boy not a girl. I think sonographers have more/ less doubt, but with my friend it seemed very, very clear to the sonographer that it was another boy. I think if you're in a country where they don't generally say, she must have been quite certain.       Add message | Report    lotti37   Fri 11-Mar-11 08:01:37    hi - i am English in India and they all want to have boys over here. The sonographer knew that I am going home to England to have the child and will stay there afterwards. I felt uncomfortable asking as there is a sign on the door saying that it is a punishable act to ask the sex of your baby. As this is my last I just was curious to know. Maybe I should have asked to see on the screen as well. Then i would have been more sure.

Don't know whether baby had legs crossed or sonographer just not up to much!       Add message | Report    EmmaBGoode   Fri 11-Mar-11 08:19:56    It is easiest to tell the sex from scan photos from a 12 week scan. The "nub" is angled differently for boys and girls.

Add message | Report    Beveridge   Fri 11-Mar-11 09:45:34    AFAIK, the standard accuracy rate given for gender scans at 20 weeks is 60%. That's quite a lot of room for error!
