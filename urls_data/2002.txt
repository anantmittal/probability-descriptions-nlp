Do your part to manage the complications of kidney disease  Heart and blood vessel problems  Anemia (low red blood cell count)  Bone problems  High blood pressure  Poor nutritional health (i.e. happens when you are not getting enough important nutrients and energy for your body to function and stay healthy)  Learn more about kidney failure and the different treatment options for it.     What is Stage 4 Kidney Disease?  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) happens if your kidneys have been damaged. Kidneys can become damaged from a physical injury or a disease like diabetes or high blood pressure. Once your kidneys are damaged, they are not able to filter blood or do their other jobs well enough to keep you healthy. Some of the important jobs kidneys do:   Filter blood  Balance your body's fluids  Regulate hormones  Help keep blood pressure under control  Keep bones healthy  Help make red blood cells   There are five stages of chronic kidney disease. The mildest are stages 1 and 2. In these early stages of kidney disease, the kidneys are damaged and not working at full strength. At stage 3, about half of kidney function has been lost. This can cause other problems, like high blood pressure or bone problems. Treatment of these problems is very important, and it can even help slow down the loss of kidney function. At stage 4, severe kidney damage has happened. At this stage, it is very important to slow the loss of kidney function by following your treatment plan, and managing other problems like high blood pressure or heart disease. Stage 5 is kidney failure. If kidney failure happens, you will need a kidney transplant or dialysis to live.  Learn About Kidney Failure  Even if you get treatment in stage 4 and are careful about your health, your kidneys may still fail. Kidney failure happens when:   85-90% of kidney function is gone  GFR falls below 15  Kidneys don't work well enough to keep you alive   There is no cure for kidney failure, but with treatment it is possible to live a long, fulfilling life. Having kidney failure is not a death sentence. People with kidney failure live active lives and continue to do the things they love.  Treatments for Kidney Failure  The two treatments for kidney failure are kidney transplantation and dialysis. Two different types of dialysis can be done - hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.   Kidney Transplantation. This is an operation that places a healthy kidney into your body. The kidney can come from someone who has died or from a living donor. A new kidney will usually function immediately. You will need special medicines to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney. If rejection happens, dialysis is needed and you can consider a second transplant. A kidney transplant is a treatment, not a cure. Kidney transplant recipients still have chronic kidney disease, and you may still need some of the other medicines you took before the transplant.   Hemodialysis (HD). Hemodialysis is a treatment that removes wastes and extra fluid from your blood. It can be done at home ("home hemodialysis") or in a dialysis center. During hemodialysis, your blood is pumped through soft tubes to a dialysis machine where it goes through a special filter called a dialyzer (also called an artificial kidney). As your blood is filtered, it is returned to your blood stream. Only a small amount of blood is out of your body at any time. In-center treatment time is 3-5 hours, 3 times a week. People who do home hemodialysis have more flexibility about how often it can be done. If done daily, treatment time would be 1½ to 2 hours. You will need an access into the bloodstream for placing needles needed for hemodialysis. Types of access include:   Fistula. A fistula is the recommended choice for an access. You will need a minor operation to create a fistula. It is made by joining an artery to a nearby vein under your skin to make a bigger blood vessel. This type of access is preferred because it has fewer problems and lasts longer. However, some people may not be able to have a fistula because of their physical condition. Sometimes, it may be possible to switch to a fistula from another type of access. If you do not have a fistula, ask your dialysis care team if a switch would be possible.  Graft. If your blood vessels are not suitable for a fistula, a graft may be used. This involves joining an artery and a nearby vein with a small, soft tube made of synthetic material. The graft is entirely beneath your skin. You will need a minor operation to create a graft.  Catheter. The third type of access, called a catheter, is inserted into a large vein in your neck or chest. The ends of the tubes sit on your skin outside your body. This type of access is generally used when you need dialysis for a short period of time. Catheters are used as a permanent access when a fistula or a graft cannot be placed.    Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). Peritoneal dialysis is a home-based treatment that can be done anywhere (at home, work, or when sleeping). It must be done daily. You will need a minor operation to place a catheter in your abdomen (belly). With peritoneal dialysis, the blood is cleaned inside your body, not outside. The lining of your abdomen (the peritoneum) acts as a natural filter. During treatment a cleansing solution, called dialysate, flows into your abdomen (your belly) through a soft tube called a PD catheter. Wastes and extra fluid pass from your blood into the cleansing solution. After several hours, you drain the used solution from your abdomen and refill with fresh cleansing solution to begin the process again. Removing the used solution and adding fresh solutions takes about a half hour and is called an "exchange."   To learn more about each type of treatment, see "Choosing a Treatment for Kidney Failure" in the A-to-Z Guide .  Can You Change Treatments for Kidney Failure?  If you start on one type of treatment for kidney failure but feel you would like to try something else, you can speak to your healthcare professional about changing. For most people, it is often possible to change treatments. For example, if you choose hemodialysis, it doesn't mean you can't switch to peritoneal dialysis at a later date. Even if you choose to have a kidney transplant, you may need a period of dialysis until you can be transplanted with a new kidney. It is not uncommon for people who have had kidney failure for many years to have had more than one type of treatment in that time.  Help Keep Your Kidney Disease from Getting Worse  Good self-management will help you to live a long, fulfilling life and continue to do the things you love. It can also help to slow or even stop kidney disease from getting worse - and it may even stop or delay kidney failure. Good self-management starts with:   Controlling other health problems you may have  Treating complications of kidney disease  Managing or preventing heart disease   Control Other Health Problems  You may have other disorders, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, which can damage your kidneys. One of the goals of your treatment is to make sure these are well-controlled. Ask your healthcare professional what you can do to keep these conditions under control - and do it! Some of the things your healthcare professional may ask you to do:   Take medications called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as part of your therapy. Studies have shown that these medications help to protect your kidney function. You may also need other blood pressure medications to control your blood pressure.  Lose weight if you are overweight  Cut down on salt in your diet to control blood pressure  If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar, follow your diet and take your medications as prescribed   Do What You Can to Manage the Complications of Kidney Disease  Kidney disease can cause other health problems throughout your body including:   Heart and blood vessel problems  Anemia (low red blood cell count)  Mineral and bone problems  High blood pressure  Poor nutritional health   If you have stage 4 kidney disease, you are probably experiencing some of these problems already. Your healthcare professional will work with you to develop a treatment plan to help manage these problems and keep them from getting worse. Treatment may include diet, exercise, and medications. It is very important that you follow your treatment plan because it can greatly improve your quality of life and how long you live. It can also help to slow or even stop kidney disease from getting worse - and it may even stop or delay kidney failure.  Manage or Prevent Heart Disease  People with stage 4 kidney disease have a high risk of having heart disease. In fact, most people with kidney disease do not die of kidney failure - they die of heart disease. Why? Because, in addition to kidney disease, they usually have one or more of the following health risks:   High blood pressure causes arteries to thicken and narrow, making it easier to form clots, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. It also causes thickening and enlargement of the heart. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to help control your blood pressure. You may also need to reduce salt in your diet.  Diabetes , especially uncontrolled diabetes, leads to more fatty deposits in arteries. These can form a clot, leading to a heart attack or stroke. If you have diabetes, you must be careful to control your blood sugar, follow your diet, and take your medications as prescribed.  Anemia reduces the flow of oxygen throughout your body, which forces your heart to work harder. As a result, your heart begins to thicken and enlarge, which can lead to heart failure or death. To treat anemia, you may need to take iron supplements and a medicine called ESA (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents). These will help your body make red blood cells, which helps increase the flow of oxygen.  Abnormal cholesterol causes fatty deposits to form in your arteries, making it easier to form clots which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. If your cholesterol is too high, your doctor may recommend changes in your diet, regular exercise and, possibly, special medications, to help lower cholesterol.  Bone and mineral disease causes your arteries to stiffen and narrow from absorbing extra calcium and phosphorus that's being shed from your bones. This reduces blood flow to your heart, which can lead to a heart attack and death. To help control bone and mineral disease, you may need to limit the amount of high-phosphorus foods in your diet, take a type of medication called a phosphate binder with your meals, and take a form of vitamin D.  Smoking causes inflammation of the blood vessels, which causes even more buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries. Smoking increases the risk of clots, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. If you smoke, you should smoke less or consider quitting.   You can help slow - or possibly prevent - heart problems by following your treatment plan. Ask your healthcare professional what you need to do to keep your heart healthy.  Tools to Help  Use these self-management tools to help you track your progress and improve your quality of life.

Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.  In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.  Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.  Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic                 Symptoms Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include:    Nausea  Vomiting  Loss of appetite  Fatigue and weakness  Sleep problems  Changes in how much you urinate  Decreased mental sharpness  Muscle twitches and cramps  Swelling of feet and ankles  Persistent itching  Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart  Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs  High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control   Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred.  When to see a doctor  Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease.  If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes    Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney A normal kidney has about 1 million filtering units. Each unit, called a glomerulus, connects to a tubule, which collects urine. Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes take a toll on kidney function by damaging these filtering units and collecting tubules and causing scarring.        Polycystic kidney Polycystic kidney A healthy kidney (left) eliminates waste from the blood and maintains the body's normal chemical balance. Fluid-filled sacs (right), called cysts, characterize polycystic kidney disease.     Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years.  Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include:   Type 1 or type 2 diabetes  High blood pressure  Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli)  Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures  Polycystic kidney disease  Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers  Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys  Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis)   Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include:   Diabetes  High blood pressure  Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease  Smoking  Obesity  Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American  Family history of kidney disease  Abnormal kidney structure  Older age   Complications Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include:   Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema)  A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening  Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease  Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures  Anemia  Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility  Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures  Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection  Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium)  Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus  Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival   Prevention To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease:   Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications. When using nonprescription pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), follow the instructions on the package. Taking too many pain relievers could lead to kidney damage and generally should be avoided if you have kidney disease. Ask your doctor whether these drugs are safe for you.  Maintain a healthy weight. If you're at a healthy weight, work to maintain it by being physically active most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about strategies for healthy weight loss. Often this involves increasing daily physical activity and reducing calories.  Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting smoking. Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop.  Manage your medical conditions with your doctor's help. If you have diseases or conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage.

Also, those with kidney disease tend not to experience symptoms until the very late stages, when the kidneys are failing or when there are large amounts of protein in the urine. This is one of the reasons why only 10% of people with chronic kidney disease know that they have it,” says Dr. Joseph Vassalotti, Chief Medical Officer at the National Kidney Foundation.  While the only way to know for sure if you have kidney disease is to get tested, Dr. Vassalotti shares 10 possible signs you may have kidney disease. If you’re at risk for kidney disease due to high blood pressure, diabetes, a family history of kidney failure or if you’re older than age 60, it’s important to get tested annually for kidney disease. Be sure to mention any symptoms you’re experiencing to your healthcare practitioner.   You're more tired, have less energy or are having trouble concentrating. A severe decrease in kidney function can lead to a buildup of toxins and impurities in the blood. This can cause people to feel tired, weak and can make it hard to concentrate. Another complication of kidney disease is anemia, which can cause weakness and fatigue.  You're having trouble sleeping. When the kidneys aren't filtering properly, toxins stay in the blood rather than leaving the body through the urine. This can make it difficult to sleep. There is also a link between obesity and chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea is more common in those with chronic kidney disease, compared with the general population.  You have dry and itchy skin. Healthy kidneys do many important jobs. They remove wastes and extra fluid from your body, help make red blood cells, help keep bones strong and work to maintain the right amount of minerals in your blood.  Dry and itchy skin can be a sign of the mineral and bone disease that often accompanies advanced kidney disease, when the kidneys are no longer able to keep the right balance of minerals and nutrients in your blood.  You feel the need to urinate more often. If you feel the need to urinate more often, especially at night, this can be a sign of kidney disease. When the kidneys filters are damaged, it can cause an increase in the urge to urinate. Sometimes this can also be a sign of a urinary infection or enlarged prostate in men.  You see blood in your urine. Healthy kidneys typically keep the blood cells in the body when filtering wastes from the blood to create urine, but when the kidney's filters have been damaged, these blood cells can start to "leak" out into the urine. In addition to signaling kidney disease, blood in the urine can be indicative of tumors, kidney stones or an infection.  Your urine is foamy. Excessive bubbles in the urine – especially those that require you to flush several times before they go away—indicate protein in the urine. This foam may look like the foam you see when scrambling eggs, as the common protein found in urine, albumin, is the same protein that is found in eggs.  You're experiencing persistent puffiness around your eyes. Protein in the urine is an early sign that the kidneys’ filters have been damaged, allowing protein to leak into the urine. This puffiness around your eyes can be due to the fact that your kidneys are leaking a large amount of protein in the urine, rather than keeping it in the body.  Your ankles and feet are swollen. Decreased kidney function can lead to sodium retention, causing swelling in your feet and ankles. Swelling in the lower extremities can also be a sign of heart disease, liver disease and chronic leg vein problems.  You have a poor appetite. This is a very general symptom, but a buildup of toxins resulting from reduced kidney function can be one of the causes.  Your muscles are cramping. Electrolyte imbalances can result from impaired kidney function. For example, low calcium levels and poorly controlled phosphorus may contribute to muscle cramping.

This damage can cause wastes to build up in the body. Kidney disease can cause other health problems, such as heart disease. If you have kidney disease, it increases your chances of having a stroke or heart attack. Major risk factors for kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, and family history of kidney failure.  Unless otherwise noted, data are from the United States Renal Data Service 2015 Annual Data Report.   Glossary  Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Sudden and temporary loss of kidney function.   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Any condition that causes reduced kidney function over a period of time. Chronic kidney disease may develop over many years and lead to end-stage kidney (or renal) disease (ESRD).  The five stages of CKD are:   Stage 1: Kidney damage with normal kidney function (estimated GFR ≥90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ) and persistent (≥3 months) proteinuria.  Stage 2: Kidney damage with mild loss of kidney function (estimated GFR 60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ) and persistent (≥3 months) proteinuria.  Stage 3: Mild-to-severe loss of kidney function (estimated GFR 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ).  Stage 4: Severe loss of kidney function (estimated GFR 15-29 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ).  Stage 5: Kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant for survival. Also known as ESRD (estimated GFR <15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ).    Dialysis: Treatment to filter wastes and water from the blood. When their kidneys fail, people need dialysis to filter their blood artificially. The two main forms of dialysis are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.   End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): Total and permanent kidney failure treated with a kidney transplant or dialysis.   Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): The rate at which the kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood; measured in milliliters per minute.   Proteinuria: Condition in which the urine has more-than-normal amounts of a protein called albumin.  Fast Facts   The overall prevalence of CKD in the general population is approximately 14 percent.  High blood pressure and diabetes are the main causes of CKD. Almost half of individuals with CKD also have diabetes and/or self-reported cardiovascular disease (CVD).  More than 661,000 Americans have kidney failure. Of these, 468,000 individuals are on dialysis, and roughly 193,000 live with a functioning kidney transplant.  Kidney disease often has no symptoms in its early stages and can go undetected until it is very advanced. (For this reason, kidney disease is often referred to as a “silent disease.”)  The adjusted incidence rate of ESRD in the United States rose sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, leveled off in the early 2000s, and has declined slightly since its peak in 2006.  Compared to Caucasians, ESRD prevalence is about 3.7 times greater in African Americans, 1.4 times greater in Native Americans, and 1.5 times greater in Asian Americans.  Each year, kidney disease kills more people than breast or prostate cancer. In 2013, more than 47,000 Americans died from kidney disease. 1    Prevalence   The overall prevalence of CKD increased from 12 percent to 14 percent between 1988 and 1994 and from 1999 to 2004 but has remained relatively stable since 2004. The largest increase occurred in people with Stage 3 CKD, from 4.5 percent to 6.0 percent, since 1988.  Women (15.93 percent) are more likely to have stages 1 to 4 CKD than men (13.52 percent). 2     Age-Adjusted Prevalence of CKD Stages 1-4 by Gender 1999-2012 2    African Americans (17.01 percent) and Mexican Americans (15.29 percent) are more likely to have CKD than Caucasians (13.99 percent). 3     Age-Adjusted Prevalence of CKD Stages 1-4 by Race/Ethnicity 1999-2012 3       CKD often occurs in the context of multiple comorbidities and has been termed a “disease multiplier.” Almost half of individuals with CKD also have diabetes and self-reported CVD.   Distribution of NHANES participants with diabetes, self-reported cardiovascular disease, and single-sample markers of CKD, 2007-2012   Abbreviations: CKD, chronic kidney disease; CVD, cardiovascular disease; DM, diabetes mellitus  CKD Awareness   CKD often has no symptoms in its early stages and can go undetected until it is very advanced. (For this reason, kidney disease is often referred to as a “silent disease”).   NHANES participants with CKD aware of their kidney disease, 2001-2012    Patient awareness is less than 10 percent for those with stages 1 to 3 CKD.  Awareness is higher among people with Stage 4 CKD, who often experience obvious symptoms.   CVD and CKD   People with CKD are at high risk for CVD, and the presence of CKD often complicates CVD treatment and prognosis.  The prevalence of CVD is 69.6 percent among persons ages 66 and older who have CKD, compared to 34.7 percent among those who do not have CKD.  Atherosclerotic heart disease is the most frequent CVD linked to CKD; its prevalence is more than 40 percent among people ages 66 and older.  The percentage of people who undergo cardiovascular procedures is higher among those with CKD than among those without CKD.   Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)   In 2013, the unadjusted rate of AKI hospitalizations in the Medicare population fell by 4.9 percent. This decrease was observed across all age and race groups.  For Medicare patients ages 66 and older with an AKI hospitalization in 2011, the cumulative probability of a recurrent AKI hospitalization within 2 years was 48 percent.  Among Medicare patients ages 66 and older with a first AKI hospitalization, the in-hospital mortality rate in 2013 was 9.5 percent (or 14.4 percent when including discharge to hospice), and less than half of all patients were discharged to their home.   Hospital discharge status of first AKI hospitalization for Medicare patients aged 66+, 2013     ESRD   After rising steadily from 1980 to 2001, the incidence rate of ESRD leveled off in the early 2000s and has declined slightly since 2006.  The number of incident (newly reported) ESRD cases in 2013 was 117,162; the unadjusted incidence rate was 363 per million/year.  Although the number of ESRD incident cases plateaued in 2010, the number of ESRD prevalent cases continues to rise by about 21,000 cases per year.  African-Americans are about 3.5 times more likely to develop ESRD than Caucasians.  Hispanics are about 1.5 times more likely to develop ESRD than non-Hispanics.  In 2013, 88.2 percent of all incident cases began renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis, 9.0 percent started with peritoneal dialysis, and 2.6 percent received a preemptive kidney transplant.  As of December 31, 2013, 63.7 percent of all prevalent ESRD cases were receiving hemodialysis therapy, 6.8 percent were being treated with peritoneal dialysis, and 29.2 percent had a functioning kidney transplant.  The leading causes of ESRD in children during 2009-2013 were: cystic/hereditary/congenital disorders (33.0 percent), glomerular disease (24.6 percent), and secondary causes of glomerulonephritis (12.9. percent).  A total of 1,462 children in the United States began ESRD care in 2013, and 9,921 children were treated for ESRD on December 31, 2013. The most common initial ESRD treatment modality among children overall was hemodialysis (56 percent).  The number of children listed for incident and repeat kidney transplant was 1,277 in 2013.   Kidney Transplants   17,600 kidney transplants were performed in the United States in 2013.  Less than one-third of the transplanted kidneys were from living donors in 2013.  From 2012 to 2013, there was a 3.1 percent increase in the cumulative number of recipients with a functioning kidney transplant.  Among candidates newly wait-listed for either a first-time or repeat kidney-alone transplant in 2009, the median waiting time to transplant was 3.6 years.  The number of deceased donors increased significantly since 2003, reaching 8,021 in 2013.  The rate of deceased donors among African Americans more than doubled from 1999 to 2013.  In 2012, the probability of 1-year graft survival was 92 percent and 97 percent for deceased and living donor kidney transplant recipients, respectively.  The probability of patient survival within 1 year post-transplant was 95 percent and 98 percent in deceased and living donor kidney transplant recipients, respectively, in 2012.  Since 1996, the probabilities of graft survival and patient survival have steadily improved among recipients of both living and deceased donor kidney transplants.   Morbidity   A notable decrease in hospitalization rates occurred from 2012 to 2013. Rates decreased by 11 percent for CKD patients and by 10.1 percent for those without CKD. However, rates of both overall and cause-specific admissions increased with advancing stages of CKD.  Hospitalizations increased among CKD patients with the presence of diabetes and CVD.  Among hemodialysis patients, the overall number of hospitalizations for ESRD in 2013 was 1.7 admissions per patient year—down from 2.1 in 2005.  Rates of readmission for CKD patients were higher than those for patients without CKD. In 2013, 22.3 percent of patients with CKD were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, compared to only 15.8 percent of those without CKD.   Adjusted percentage of patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, among Medicare CKD patients aged 66+, discharged alive from an all-cause index hospitalization between January 1 and December 1, by year, 2001-2013    Mortality   In 2013, adjusted mortality rates remained higher for Medicare patients with CKD (117.9/1,000) than for those without CKD (47.5/1,000); and these rates increased with CKD severity, although this gap narrowed during the period 2001 to 2013.  Male patients had slightly higher mortality rates (52.6/1,000) than females (43.4/1,000); this was more prevalent among those with CKD (males: 128.7/1,000; females: 110.0/1,000).  Mortality rates continue to decrease for dialysis and transplant patients, having fallen by 28 percent and 40 percent, respectively, since 1996.  CVD contributes to more than half of all deaths among patients with ESRD. Arrhythmias and cardiac arrest alone were responsible for more than one-third (37 percent) of CVD deaths.   Causes of death in ESRD patients, 2012-2014   Abbreviations: AMI, acute myocardial infarction; ASHD, atherosclerotic heart disease; CHF, congestive heart failure; CVA, cerebrovascular accident   Overall, the rates of death among Medicare patients with CKD are declining; however, they are higher in patients with CKD than without CKD.  The presence of diabetes and CVD along with CKD increases the risk of death.   All-cause mortality rates (per 1,000 patient years at risk) for Medicare patients aged 66+, by CKD status and year, 2001-2013 (adjusted)    Medicare Spending for CKD   Medicare spending for patients with CKD ages 65 and older exceeded $50 billion in 2013 and represented 20 percent of all Medicare spending in this age group.  More than 70 percent of Medicare spending for CKD patients ages 65 and older was incurred by those who also had diabetes, congestive heart failure, or both.  Although spending was 12.7 percent higher for African Americans than Caucasians in 2013, this represented a reduction from the 19.6 percent gap that occurred in 2010.  Spending was more than twice as high for patients with all three chronic conditions of CKD, diabetes, and congestive heart failure ($38,230) than in patients with only CKD ($15,614).  Medicare fee-for-service spending for ESRD beneficiaries rose by 1.6 percent, from $30.4 billion in 2012 to $30.9 billion in 2013, accounting for 7.1 percent of the overall Medicare paid claims costs.

Studying the genes of families that have more kidney disease is just one of the research areas supported by the National Kidney Foundation. One recent research project looked at how genes affect the causes of kidney disease. “My grandfather had hypertension for 45 years,” reported Dr. Sun Woo Kang, a South Korean–born nephrologist and researcher. “My father has had diabetes and hypertension for 25 years. He also had heart bypass surgery. Then, it was recently discovered that I had certain precursors for cardiovascular or kidney disease similar to my father, and my father’s father. I became even more interested in human genetics as it relates to cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.” Dr Kang is working long hours in the laboratory at the Center for Human Genetics and Genomics at the University of California at San Diego. Dr Kang’s research is funded with a National Kidney Foundation Fellowship. He is testing blood samples and DNA of patients with kidney failure, who volunteered because they were on dialysis at one of three Southern California medical centers. It is hoped this will help him discover if any genetic factors exist when it comes to cardiovascular and kidney disease. “Of people suffering from hypertension, there is a small group that is genetically at a high risk of developing hypertensive kidney disease,” he says. “I’m here to find out why and to help them.” That group, Dr. Kang adds, would get more intensive treatment, shown to reduce the onset of this disease. Since kidney disease can affect some families more than others, Dr. Kang is one of many researchers who are looking for genes by collecting blood samples from people with CKD and their families. Then, they compare the genes in those with kidney disease to a group of individuals who do not have kidney disease. Understanding the causes of kidney disease could lead to new ways to treat these medical problems. In addition, knowing which people carry kidney disease genes will allow doctors to find people at risk earlier. If they know who is at risk for developing kidney disease, they may know who could benefit most from early treatment and more frequent doctor visits. What should you do if you have a number of family members with diabetes, hypertension or other causes of kidney disease? If you have diabetes and have a brother, sister or parent with diabetic kidney disease, the chance that you will have kidney disease during is higher. Genes might be part of the reason that African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Native American or Native Alaskan people have higher risks. If you have diabetes but do not have a relative with diabetic kidney disease, you have a lower chance of having diabetic kidney disease over the course of your lifetime. What can you do if you have a family history of kidney problems? Family members of those with kidney disease should tell their doctors, so they can learn if they need to be screened for kidney disease. Experts say that if one member of a family has kidney failure, all blood relatives over the age of 18 should be tested for kidney problems. Tell the doctor your family health history. It is especially important for the doctor to know: You have a blood relative who has or had kidney failure (and the cause of the kidney failure, if you know it). About health problems that put you at risk for kidney failure (including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney infections, kidney stones, and prostate problems, for example). Attend a kidney screening program sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation. Look for screenings in your area at www.kidney.org . What can you do if you have a family history of heart problems? Like diabetes and hypertension, family history is a strong predictor of having heart disease in the general population. And, heart disease is a strong predictor of chronic kidney disease. Family history is one way physicians who treat families can look more closely for certain diseases. If someone in your family has heart disease, you should talk to your doctor about being tested for kidney disease. What should you do if you know your family has an inherited kidney disease? You should tell your doctor about your family history. Two rare types of kidney disease are known to be inherited: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD). PKD usually refers to a genetic or inherited disease that is sometimes called “adult PKD” because it normally appears in adult life. A less common type of PKD occurs primarily in babies and children. In PKD, cysts, or fluid–filled pouches, are found primarily in the kidney but they can also affect other organs, including the liver, pancreas, spleen. The adult type of PKD (also called autosomal dominant PKD or ADPKD) is passed from parent to child by an autosomal dominant type of inheritance. This means that only one copy of the abnormal gene is needed to cause the disease. Therefore, if one parent has the disease, each child has a 50–50 chance of developing the disease. Fabry disease is an inherited disorder that causes many different symptoms from mild to severe and life–threatening. The kidneys are one of the major organs affected by Fabry disease. Kidney failure may occur in some people who have Fabry disease. Good news for families at risk was reported in 2010. A team of researchers from the United States and Europe found more than a dozen genes that may play a role in common forms of kidney disease. The team looked at the DNA sequences in more than 65,000 people. Common variations in several genes were found to be more common among people with chronic kidney disease than in those with normal kidney function. Researchers hope these results will explain how and why kidney disease clusters in some families.

Kidney disease is significantly underdiagnosed and excessive protein in the urine (albuminuria) is one of the earliest signs of kidney damage. Usually invisible to the human eye, often this red flag for kidney disease is undetected because not enough people who are at risk are receiving urine testing.  Take the National Kidney Foundation's Quick Kidney Risk Check to find out if you're at risk for kidney disease--and what steps you can take to reduce your risk.  This quiz was based on a study by Paul Muntner, PhD and was originally published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation.

To find out how well your kidneys are doing, we measure the quantity of waste that circulates in your blood.     This is a test used to check how well the kidneys are working by estimating how much waste is in your blood. The more waste products in your blood the lower the filtration rate.           Causes     The two main causes of CKD are diabetes and hypertension, which are responsible for up to two-thirds of all cases.  Immune and inherited causes, as well as other reasons, are responsible for the rest.                   North Americans have CKD and more than 26 million have some form of the disease.         North Americans over the age of 65 have some form of CKD.         North Americans with kidney failure are currently awaiting kidney transplants.             Kidney Failure Risk Equation  Using the patient's Urine, Sex, Age and GFR, the kidney failure risk equation provides the 2 and 5 year probability of treated kidney failure for a potential patient with CKD stage 3 to 5.         The equation has been validated in more than 30 countries worldwide, making it the most accurate and efficient way of finding out the patient's risk.               What's your risk of kidney failure?  Use the Kidney Failure Risk Equation to determine 2 and 5 year probability of treated kidney failure (dialysis or transplantation) for a patient with CKD stage 3 to 5.

The four and eight variable equations accurately predict the 2 and 5 year probability of treated kidney failure (dialysis or transplantation) for a potential patient with CKD Stage 3 to 5. Predicted risks may differ from observed risks in clinical populations with lower and higher observed risks than the study population, and a calibration factor for non-North American cohorts has been added.  Determining the probability of kidney failure may be useful for patient and provider communication, triage and management of nephrology referrals and timing of dialysis access placement and living related kidney transplant. Prospective trials evaluating the utility of this instrument for clinical decision making are in progress.  References    Tangri N, Stevens LA, Griffith J, et al.

at risk?     See page en Español               Anyone can get kidney disease, but some things can make it more likely to happen to you. In fact, 1 in 3 adults in the United States are at risk for getting kidney disease.  Kidney disease is most often caused by diabetes or high blood pressure. Both of these health problems can cause permanent damage to your kidneys. When your kidneys have been permanently damaged and aren't working as well as they should, it's called chronic kidney disease (CKD), or kidney disease for short.  Diabetes and high blood pressure aren't the only things that can cause kidney disease. Other common risk factors for kidney disease include:   Heart (cardiovascular) disease  Having a family member who had kidney disease  Being African-American, Asian, Native American or Hispanic  Being over age 60 If you are at risk for kidney disease, ask your doctor how often you should be tested.   If you catch and treat kidney disease early, you may be able to prevent it from getting worse!     Diabetes  High blood pressure (hypertension)  Family history  Age  Race/ethnicity  Other causes   Diabetes  Over 29 million people in the United States have diabetes. Diabetes is the #1 cause of kidney failure. A special diet, exercise and medicines can help manage diabetes and prevent complications, but some people with diabetes may still develop kidney disease, even with good medical care. Learn more about diabetes.  Return to top  High blood pressure (hypertension)  High blood pressure is the #2 cause of kidney failure. High blood pressure can be both a cause of kidney disease, and a symptom of it because healthy kidneys help regulate your blood pressure. Keeping your blood pressure under control can help prevent kidney disease, or help keep it from getting worse. Learn more about High blood pressure (hypertension) .  Return to top  Family history  Knowing your family health history provides you with important information about your risk for disease. If you know you are at risk for kidney disease, you can take steps to protect your health. To be at risk means it is more likely you will get kidney disease.  Return to top  Age  Being over age 60 increases your risk for kidney disease.  Over time, the kidneys lose some function naturally. People who are over 60 are also at more likely to have diabetes and high blood pressure, the two leading causes of kidney failure.  If you are over age 60, ask your doctor how often you should be tested for signs of kidney disease.  Return to top  Race/ethnicity  African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans and Asian-Americans are more likely to have kidney disease. Doctors and researchers are not exactly sure why these groups are more at risk for kidney disease. It may be because these groups tend to have higher rates of diabetes and high blood pressure, the two leading causes of kidney failure. Access to health care and other factors may also contribute. Learn more about race and ethnicity's link to kidney disease.  Return to top  Other causes  Although diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of kidney disease, other diseases and conditions can also lead to kidney disease and kidney failure. Some examples of other causes of kidney failure include:   Polycystic kidney disease : a genetic disease that causes many cysts to grow in the kidneys.  Glomerulonephritis : a disease causing irritation to the tiny filters (glomeruli) in your kidneys.  Acute kidney injury : kidney failure that happens very quickly, often because of injuries, major blood loss or some reactions to medicines.  Autoimmune diseases (such as lupus and IgA nephropathy ): diseases in which your immune system attacks your own body.  Kidney cancer : cancer that grows inside your kidneys.   Having one of these conditions does not always mean that you will have kidney failure. Talk to your doctor about how to prevent kidney failure as part of your care for your condition.

International guidelines adopted in 2012 make it seem that way. They define the disease in terms of how efficiently kidneys filter the waste from our blood, a measure called the glomerular filtration rate. Healthy young people commonly have G.F.R.s of about 120. A G.F.R. lower than 60 or another marker of kidney damage (such as protein in the urine) for more than three months means chronic kidney disease. At which point, patients become scared. “When you’re told you have a disease, that’s a bad day,” said Dr. Ann O’Hare, a nephrologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who specializes in treating older adults. “Patients worry about dialysis, because that’s what they associate with kidney disease.” Chronic kidney disease causes no symptoms until its later stages, and most seniors with the diagnosis are told they’re at Stage 3, of five — sudden, unwelcome news. Because Medicare uses these benchmarks for billing and reimbursement, they’ve become, in effect, the official definition of the disease for older Americans. But wait a minute. Kidney function declines with age in almost everyone, and the proportion of older people with G.F.R. readings below 60 approaches 50 percent, studies have found. As the older adult population grows, the prevalence may rise even higher.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Yet the proportion of older people who will ever reach kidney failure, and thus need dialysis or a transplant, remains very low. People don’t turn to dialysis until their G.F.R. sinks much further, to about 10. In the great majority of older adults, that will never happen. The lifetime risk of kidney failure in the United States is 3.6 percent for whites and 8 percent for African-Americans, one widely cited study found. “Probably a majority of older patients we see have some degree of impaired renal function,” said Dr. Michael Steinman, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. “The chances are far and away that they’ll die of something else, and their kidneys will never be a problem.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   “Why are we even thinking about this as a disease?” Indeed, a small but spirited cadre of physicians and researchers are arguing — most recently in JAMA — that the guidelines should be recalibrated by age . By using the same standards for everyone, “We’re labeling and medicalizing and victimizing a substantial fraction of the elderly population,” said Dr. Richard Glassock, an author of the article and a nephrologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Instead, Dr. Glassock and others propose that in people older than 65, the diagnosis should require a G.F.R. reading less than 45. At that lower threshold, they estimate, a third to half of the chronic kidney disease diagnosed in older patients would suddenly disappear. These patients should just be considered … old, the researchers say, with lower kidney function normal for their ages. Age figures in the diagnostic criteria for some diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or osteoporosis. But doctors diagnosing other conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, use the same benchmarks for everyone. When it comes to kidney decline, Dr. O’Hare said, a G.F.R. below 60 would cause great concern in a 20-year-old. At older ages, “it’s a gray zone.” Most G.F.R. readings that fall below 60 in older adults remain in the 45 to 59 range, considered a modest reduction in kidney function. Most of these seniors will not have protein in their urine or other evidence of kidney damage. “People are being told they have a condition and it doesn’t really mean anything,” Dr. O’Hare said. In the same JAMA issue, though, another group of physician researchers warned against changing the guidelines .

They point out that although the relative risk of dying is actually higher in younger people with chronic kidney disease, the absolute risk — the numbers of people who die from it — is higher at older ages . Moreover, they argue, an older person with low G.F.R. and protein in his urine (called proteinuria or albuminuria) can take some steps to reduce the risk of eventual kidney failure, even if that’s already extremely low. Certain blood pressure medications with tongue-tangling names may protect the kidneys, for instance, though their effect on older adults is also a matter of debate . A diagnosis can also help patients avoid drugs that can harm kidneys, said Dr. Levey and a co-author, Dr. Josef Coresh, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (Both were part of the working group that developed the guidelines.) Doctors can modify medication dosages and warn older patients away from drugs that can impair kidney function, like ibuprofen, certain injected antibiotics, and the contrast dyes used in CT scans. Generally, though, what a doctor tells an older patient found to have chronic kidney disease is fairly standard counsel: Control your blood pressure, which exacerbates kidney disease and vice versa, and your cholesterol. Manage your diabetes. Keep track of drugs. “That’s just sensible, healthy living, whether you have kidney disease or not,” Dr. Glassock said. So he questions whether we should even call somewhat reduced kidney function at older ages a disease. It may amount to more than semantics. Along with fears of sitting in a dialysis center three days a week for the rest of one’s life come the costs of additional tests, appointments and referrals to specialists. “It pulls people into further engagement with the health care system,” Dr. O’Hare said. Most older adults face plenty of that already. Still, here’s the reality: Revising the international guidelines, a protracted and complicated undertaking, doesn’t appear to be in the cards. The definition we have is the one we’re going to have for years, maybe for good. Many older people are likely at some point to hear a physician say they have chronic kidney disease. How should they respond? No special screening is required to learn one’s glomerular filtration rate. It’s part of the common basic metabolic panel. Most of us have it in our records somewhere.

Doctors need to put these numbers in perspective, to explain that kidneys age with the rest of us. It makes sense to repeat the test to see if the G.F.R. remains stable or continues to fall; it also makes sense to test the urine for protein. Physicians can use risk predictors —some exist, more are coming — to help determine an individual’s odds of kidney failure. That way, Dr. Levey said, “we’re identifying the patients at risk for the worst outcomes and reassuring the others.”   But reassurance should be by far the more common response, whether a physician uses the D-word or not. “I don’t think this is something to lose sleep over,” Dr. O’Hare tells patients with modestly lower but stable G.F.R., and no other indications of kidney damage. “That’s often a huge relief.”   A version of this article appears in print on September 15, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: A Diagnosis of Dubious Meaning.

Please Enter Your ZIP Code:          Find a Class                  What Is Dialysis and When Do I Start?  What is dialysis?  Dialysis is a treatment that removes wastes and excess fluid from your blood.  If I have kidney disease, will I need dialysis?  In the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) , you do not need dialysis. The stages of chronic kidney disease can last for many years. But if your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant to keep you alive.    When should I start dialysis?  National Kidney Foundation guidelines recommend you start dialysis when your kidney function drops to 15% or less — or if you have severe symptoms caused by your kidney disease, such as: shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea or vomiting. Your doctor will help you decide when to start dialysis, based on results of lab tests that measure how much kidney function you have left and on your symptoms.  Private insurance generally covers treatment for kidney failure whenever your doctor says it is needed. If you don’t have private insurance, you may be able to get coverage through federal or state funded health care programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid.  Most people (about 93% of those who apply) qualify for Medicare when they need dialysis or a transplant, even if they are under age 65. Medicare pays for 80% of treatment costs of kidney disease when kidney function has dropped to 10 – 15%, or when your doctor justifies it.  If you are not having symptoms, you may be able to wait a bit longer before you begin dialysis. However, some doctors believe that starting dialysis as soon as Medicare or insurance covers it is wise, since it can take a long time to recover if you let yourself get very ill. Since chronic kidney failure often happens slowly, sometimes people do not even know how bad they feel, until they start dialysis and begin to feel much better.  It is important to start getting ready for dialysis or a transplant well in advance — when your kidney disease reaches Stage 4 (severe, with glomerular filtration rate , or GFR, less than 30 mL/min). Learning about the types of dialysis and transplant options will help you make a choice that is best for you. Any type of dialysis will require surgery — usually outpatient — to allow access for your treatments, and this should be done well in advance to allow time for healing.  Who pays for dialysis?  Dialysis is paid for with your health insurance and Medicare (even if you are under age 65). If you have an employer group health plan, it will pay first for 30 – 33 months, and Medicare will be secondary (paying some or all of the balance your insurance doesn’t cover). After 30 – 33 months, Medicare pays first and your health plan is secondary.  Ask your dialysis or transplant center to help you figure out what your insurance will pay and how much you will be expected to pay out-of-pocket. You can also call DaVita Guest Services at 1-800-244-0680 from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. (PT).  Once I am on dialysis, will my kidneys get better?  The chances that your kidneys will get better depend on what caused your kidney failure. Kidney failure is divided into two general categories, acute and chronic. Acute (or sudden) kidney failure is often temporary. In chronic kidney failure, the kidneys normally do not heal.  In acute kidney failure , when kidneys stop functioning due to a sudden stress, kidney function may recover. But when the damage to your kidneys has been continuous and progressive over a number of years, as it is in chronic kidney disease (CKD), then the kidneys usually do not get better. When CKD has progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD) , it is considered irreversible.  Typical causes of acute (sudden) kidney failure are:   Insufficient blood supply to the kidneys  Obstructed urine flow  Reactions to allergens, toxic substances, or an acute autoimmune attack on the kidneys   Typical causes of chronic (gradual) kidney failure are:   Type I and Type II diabetes  High blood pressure  Glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli, the tiny clusters of blood vessels that filter your blood)  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)  Long-term autoimmune attack on the kidneys  Prolonged urinary tract obstruction   If your chronic kidney disease was not diagnosed until you were at the point of needing dialysis or a transplant, then it may seem sudden to you. However, the gradual injuries to your kidneys that occurred over a number of years caused permanent damage.  If you have acute kidney failure, you may need dialysis for only a few days or weeks while your kidneys recover. If your kidneys are too badly damaged to recover their function, then you will need long-term dialysis or a kidney transplant to live.  If it seems that your kidneys are recovering, talk to your doctor to learn whether it could be true. Tests can be done to determine whether your kidney function has improved.

What is Stage 4 Kidney Disease?  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) happens if your kidneys have been damaged. Kidneys can become damaged from a physical injury or a disease like diabetes or high blood pressure. Once your kidneys are damaged, they are not able to filter blood or do their other jobs well enough to keep you healthy. Some of the important jobs kidneys do:   Filter blood  Balance your body's fluids  Regulate hormones  Help keep blood pressure under control  Keep bones healthy  Help make red blood cells   There are five stages of chronic kidney disease. The mildest are stages 1 and 2. In these early stages of kidney disease, the kidneys are damaged and not working at full strength. At stage 3, about half of kidney function has been lost. This can cause other problems, like high blood pressure or bone problems. Treatment of these problems is very important, and it can even help slow down the loss of kidney function. At stage 4, severe kidney damage has happened. At this stage, it is very important to slow the loss of kidney function by following your treatment plan, and managing other problems like high blood pressure or heart disease. Stage 5 is kidney failure. If kidney failure happens, you will need a kidney transplant or dialysis to live.  Learn About Kidney Failure  Even if you get treatment in stage 4 and are careful about your health, your kidneys may still fail. Kidney failure happens when:   85-90% of kidney function is gone  GFR falls below 15  Kidneys don't work well enough to keep you alive   There is no cure for kidney failure, but with treatment it is possible to live a long, fulfilling life. Having kidney failure is not a death sentence. People with kidney failure live active lives and continue to do the things they love.  Treatments for Kidney Failure  The two treatments for kidney failure are kidney transplantation and dialysis. Two different types of dialysis can be done - hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.   Kidney Transplantation. This is an operation that places a healthy kidney into your body. The kidney can come from someone who has died or from a living donor. A new kidney will usually function immediately. You will need special medicines to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney. If rejection happens, dialysis is needed and you can consider a second transplant. A kidney transplant is a treatment, not a cure. Kidney transplant recipients still have chronic kidney disease, and you may still need some of the other medicines you took before the transplant.   Hemodialysis (HD). Hemodialysis is a treatment that removes wastes and extra fluid from your blood. It can be done at home ("home hemodialysis") or in a dialysis center. During hemodialysis, your blood is pumped through soft tubes to a dialysis machine where it goes through a special filter called a dialyzer (also called an artificial kidney). As your blood is filtered, it is returned to your blood stream. Only a small amount of blood is out of your body at any time. In-center treatment time is 3-5 hours, 3 times a week. People who do home hemodialysis have more flexibility about how often it can be done. If done daily, treatment time would be 1½ to 2 hours. You will need an access into the bloodstream for placing needles needed for hemodialysis. Types of access include:   Fistula. A fistula is the recommended choice for an access. You will need a minor operation to create a fistula. It is made by joining an artery to a nearby vein under your skin to make a bigger blood vessel. This type of access is preferred because it has fewer problems and lasts longer. However, some people may not be able to have a fistula because of their physical condition. Sometimes, it may be possible to switch to a fistula from another type of access. If you do not have a fistula, ask your dialysis care team if a switch would be possible.  Graft. If your blood vessels are not suitable for a fistula, a graft may be used. This involves joining an artery and a nearby vein with a small, soft tube made of synthetic material. The graft is entirely beneath your skin. You will need a minor operation to create a graft.  Catheter. The third type of access, called a catheter, is inserted into a large vein in your neck or chest. The ends of the tubes sit on your skin outside your body. This type of access is generally used when you need dialysis for a short period of time. Catheters are used as a permanent access when a fistula or a graft cannot be placed.    Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). Peritoneal dialysis is a home-based treatment that can be done anywhere (at home, work, or when sleeping). It must be done daily. You will need a minor operation to place a catheter in your abdomen (belly). With peritoneal dialysis, the blood is cleaned inside your body, not outside. The lining of your abdomen (the peritoneum) acts as a natural filter. During treatment a cleansing solution, called dialysate, flows into your abdomen (your belly) through a soft tube called a PD catheter. Wastes and extra fluid pass from your blood into the cleansing solution. After several hours, you drain the used solution from your abdomen and refill with fresh cleansing solution to begin the process again. Removing the used solution and adding fresh solutions takes about a half hour and is called an "exchange."   To learn more about each type of treatment, see "Choosing a Treatment for Kidney Failure" in the A-to-Z Guide .  Can You Change Treatments for Kidney Failure?  If you start on one type of treatment for kidney failure but feel you would like to try something else, you can speak to your healthcare professional about changing. For most people, it is often possible to change treatments. For example, if you choose hemodialysis, it doesn't mean you can't switch to peritoneal dialysis at a later date. Even if you choose to have a kidney transplant, you may need a period of dialysis until you can be transplanted with a new kidney. It is not uncommon for people who have had kidney failure for many years to have had more than one type of treatment in that time.  Help Keep Your Kidney Disease from Getting Worse  Good self-management will help you to live a long, fulfilling life and continue to do the things you love. It can also help to slow or even stop kidney disease from getting worse - and it may even stop or delay kidney failure. Good self-management starts with:   Controlling other health problems you may have  Treating complications of kidney disease  Managing or preventing heart disease   Control Other Health Problems  You may have other disorders, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, which can damage your kidneys. One of the goals of your treatment is to make sure these are well-controlled. Ask your healthcare professional what you can do to keep these conditions under control - and do it! Some of the things your healthcare professional may ask you to do:   Take medications called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as part of your therapy. Studies have shown that these medications help to protect your kidney function. You may also need other blood pressure medications to control your blood pressure.  Lose weight if you are overweight  Cut down on salt in your diet to control blood pressure  If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar, follow your diet and take your medications as prescribed   Do What You Can to Manage the Complications of Kidney Disease  Kidney disease can cause other health problems throughout your body including:   Heart and blood vessel problems  Anemia (low red blood cell count)  Mineral and bone problems  High blood pressure  Poor nutritional health   If you have stage 4 kidney disease, you are probably experiencing some of these problems already. Your healthcare professional will work with you to develop a treatment plan to help manage these problems and keep them from getting worse. Treatment may include diet, exercise, and medications. It is very important that you follow your treatment plan because it can greatly improve your quality of life and how long you live. It can also help to slow or even stop kidney disease from getting worse - and it may even stop or delay kidney failure.  Manage or Prevent Heart Disease  People with stage 4 kidney disease have a high risk of having heart disease. In fact, most people with kidney disease do not die of kidney failure - they die of heart disease. Why? Because, in addition to kidney disease, they usually have one or more of the following health risks:   High blood pressure causes arteries to thicken and narrow, making it easier to form clots, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. It also causes thickening and enlargement of the heart. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to help control your blood pressure. You may also need to reduce salt in your diet.  Diabetes , especially uncontrolled diabetes, leads to more fatty deposits in arteries. These can form a clot, leading to a heart attack or stroke. If you have diabetes, you must be careful to control your blood sugar, follow your diet, and take your medications as prescribed.  Anemia reduces the flow of oxygen throughout your body, which forces your heart to work harder. As a result, your heart begins to thicken and enlarge, which can lead to heart failure or death. To treat anemia, you may need to take iron supplements and a medicine called ESA (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents). These will help your body make red blood cells, which helps increase the flow of oxygen.  Abnormal cholesterol causes fatty deposits to form in your arteries, making it easier to form clots which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. If your cholesterol is too high, your doctor may recommend changes in your diet, regular exercise and, possibly, special medications, to help lower cholesterol.  Bone and mineral disease causes your arteries to stiffen and narrow from absorbing extra calcium and phosphorus that's being shed from your bones. This reduces blood flow to your heart, which can lead to a heart attack and death. To help control bone and mineral disease, you may need to limit the amount of high-phosphorus foods in your diet, take a type of medication called a phosphate binder with your meals, and take a form of vitamin D.  Smoking causes inflammation of the blood vessels, which causes even more buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries. Smoking increases the risk of clots, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. If you smoke, you should smoke less or consider quitting.   You can help slow - or possibly prevent - heart problems by following your treatment plan. Ask your healthcare professional what you need to do to keep your heart healthy.  Tools to Help  Use these self-management tools to help you track your progress and improve your quality of life.

Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.  In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.  Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.  Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic                 Symptoms Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include:    Nausea  Vomiting  Loss of appetite  Fatigue and weakness  Sleep problems  Changes in how much you urinate  Decreased mental sharpness  Muscle twitches and cramps  Swelling of feet and ankles  Persistent itching  Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart  Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs  High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control   Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred.  When to see a doctor  Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease.  If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes    Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney A normal kidney has about 1 million filtering units. Each unit, called a glomerulus, connects to a tubule, which collects urine. Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes take a toll on kidney function by damaging these filtering units and collecting tubules and causing scarring.        Polycystic kidney Polycystic kidney A healthy kidney (left) eliminates waste from the blood and maintains the body's normal chemical balance. Fluid-filled sacs (right), called cysts, characterize polycystic kidney disease.     Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years.  Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include:   Type 1 or type 2 diabetes  High blood pressure  Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli)  Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures  Polycystic kidney disease  Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers  Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys  Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis)   Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include:   Diabetes  High blood pressure  Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease  Smoking  Obesity  Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American  Family history of kidney disease  Abnormal kidney structure  Older age   Complications Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include:   Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema)  A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening  Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease  Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures  Anemia  Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility  Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures  Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection  Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium)  Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus  Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival   Prevention To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease:   Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications. When using nonprescription pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), follow the instructions on the package. Taking too many pain relievers could lead to kidney damage and generally should be avoided if you have kidney disease. Ask your doctor whether these drugs are safe for you.  Maintain a healthy weight. If you're at a healthy weight, work to maintain it by being physically active most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about strategies for healthy weight loss. Often this involves increasing daily physical activity and reducing calories.  Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting smoking. Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop.  Manage your medical conditions with your doctor's help. If you have diseases or conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage.

Also, those with kidney disease tend not to experience symptoms until the very late stages, when the kidneys are failing or when there are large amounts of protein in the urine. This is one of the reasons why only 10% of people with chronic kidney disease know that they have it,” says Dr. Joseph Vassalotti, Chief Medical Officer at the National Kidney Foundation.  While the only way to know for sure if you have kidney disease is to get tested, Dr. Vassalotti shares 10 possible signs you may have kidney disease. If you’re at risk for kidney disease due to high blood pressure, diabetes, a family history of kidney failure or if you’re older than age 60, it’s important to get tested annually for kidney disease. Be sure to mention any symptoms you’re experiencing to your healthcare practitioner.   You're more tired, have less energy or are having trouble concentrating. A severe decrease in kidney function can lead to a buildup of toxins and impurities in the blood. This can cause people to feel tired, weak and can make it hard to concentrate. Another complication of kidney disease is anemia, which can cause weakness and fatigue.  You're having trouble sleeping. When the kidneys aren't filtering properly, toxins stay in the blood rather than leaving the body through the urine. This can make it difficult to sleep. There is also a link between obesity and chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea is more common in those with chronic kidney disease, compared with the general population.  You have dry and itchy skin. Healthy kidneys do many important jobs. They remove wastes and extra fluid from your body, help make red blood cells, help keep bones strong and work to maintain the right amount of minerals in your blood.  Dry and itchy skin can be a sign of the mineral and bone disease that often accompanies advanced kidney disease, when the kidneys are no longer able to keep the right balance of minerals and nutrients in your blood.  You feel the need to urinate more often. If you feel the need to urinate more often, especially at night, this can be a sign of kidney disease. When the kidneys filters are damaged, it can cause an increase in the urge to urinate. Sometimes this can also be a sign of a urinary infection or enlarged prostate in men.  You see blood in your urine. Healthy kidneys typically keep the blood cells in the body when filtering wastes from the blood to create urine, but when the kidney's filters have been damaged, these blood cells can start to "leak" out into the urine. In addition to signaling kidney disease, blood in the urine can be indicative of tumors, kidney stones or an infection.  Your urine is foamy. Excessive bubbles in the urine – especially those that require you to flush several times before they go away—indicate protein in the urine. This foam may look like the foam you see when scrambling eggs, as the common protein found in urine, albumin, is the same protein that is found in eggs.  You're experiencing persistent puffiness around your eyes. Protein in the urine is an early sign that the kidneys’ filters have been damaged, allowing protein to leak into the urine. This puffiness around your eyes can be due to the fact that your kidneys are leaking a large amount of protein in the urine, rather than keeping it in the body.  Your ankles and feet are swollen. Decreased kidney function can lead to sodium retention, causing swelling in your feet and ankles. Swelling in the lower extremities can also be a sign of heart disease, liver disease and chronic leg vein problems.  You have a poor appetite. This is a very general symptom, but a buildup of toxins resulting from reduced kidney function can be one of the causes.  Your muscles are cramping. Electrolyte imbalances can result from impaired kidney function. For example, low calcium levels and poorly controlled phosphorus may contribute to muscle cramping.

This damage can cause wastes to build up in the body. Kidney disease can cause other health problems, such as heart disease. If you have kidney disease, it increases your chances of having a stroke or heart attack. Major risk factors for kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, and family history of kidney failure.  Unless otherwise noted, data are from the United States Renal Data Service 2015 Annual Data Report.   Glossary  Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Sudden and temporary loss of kidney function.   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Any condition that causes reduced kidney function over a period of time. Chronic kidney disease may develop over many years and lead to end-stage kidney (or renal) disease (ESRD).  The five stages of CKD are:   Stage 1: Kidney damage with normal kidney function (estimated GFR ≥90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ) and persistent (≥3 months) proteinuria.  Stage 2: Kidney damage with mild loss of kidney function (estimated GFR 60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ) and persistent (≥3 months) proteinuria.  Stage 3: Mild-to-severe loss of kidney function (estimated GFR 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ).  Stage 4: Severe loss of kidney function (estimated GFR 15-29 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ).  Stage 5: Kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant for survival. Also known as ESRD (estimated GFR <15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ).    Dialysis: Treatment to filter wastes and water from the blood. When their kidneys fail, people need dialysis to filter their blood artificially. The two main forms of dialysis are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.   End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): Total and permanent kidney failure treated with a kidney transplant or dialysis.   Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): The rate at which the kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood; measured in milliliters per minute.   Proteinuria: Condition in which the urine has more-than-normal amounts of a protein called albumin.  Fast Facts   The overall prevalence of CKD in the general population is approximately 14 percent.  High blood pressure and diabetes are the main causes of CKD. Almost half of individuals with CKD also have diabetes and/or self-reported cardiovascular disease (CVD).  More than 661,000 Americans have kidney failure. Of these, 468,000 individuals are on dialysis, and roughly 193,000 live with a functioning kidney transplant.  Kidney disease often has no symptoms in its early stages and can go undetected until it is very advanced. (For this reason, kidney disease is often referred to as a “silent disease.”)  The adjusted incidence rate of ESRD in the United States rose sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, leveled off in the early 2000s, and has declined slightly since its peak in 2006.  Compared to Caucasians, ESRD prevalence is about 3.7 times greater in African Americans, 1.4 times greater in Native Americans, and 1.5 times greater in Asian Americans.  Each year, kidney disease kills more people than breast or prostate cancer. In 2013, more than 47,000 Americans died from kidney disease. 1    Prevalence   The overall prevalence of CKD increased from 12 percent to 14 percent between 1988 and 1994 and from 1999 to 2004 but has remained relatively stable since 2004. The largest increase occurred in people with Stage 3 CKD, from 4.5 percent to 6.0 percent, since 1988.  Women (15.93 percent) are more likely to have stages 1 to 4 CKD than men (13.52 percent). 2     Age-Adjusted Prevalence of CKD Stages 1-4 by Gender 1999-2012 2    African Americans (17.01 percent) and Mexican Americans (15.29 percent) are more likely to have CKD than Caucasians (13.99 percent). 3     Age-Adjusted Prevalence of CKD Stages 1-4 by Race/Ethnicity 1999-2012 3       CKD often occurs in the context of multiple comorbidities and has been termed a “disease multiplier.” Almost half of individuals with CKD also have diabetes and self-reported CVD.   Distribution of NHANES participants with diabetes, self-reported cardiovascular disease, and single-sample markers of CKD, 2007-2012   Abbreviations: CKD, chronic kidney disease; CVD, cardiovascular disease; DM, diabetes mellitus  CKD Awareness   CKD often has no symptoms in its early stages and can go undetected until it is very advanced. (For this reason, kidney disease is often referred to as a “silent disease”).   NHANES participants with CKD aware of their kidney disease, 2001-2012    Patient awareness is less than 10 percent for those with stages 1 to 3 CKD.  Awareness is higher among people with Stage 4 CKD, who often experience obvious symptoms.   CVD and CKD   People with CKD are at high risk for CVD, and the presence of CKD often complicates CVD treatment and prognosis.  The prevalence of CVD is 69.6 percent among persons ages 66 and older who have CKD, compared to 34.7 percent among those who do not have CKD.  Atherosclerotic heart disease is the most frequent CVD linked to CKD; its prevalence is more than 40 percent among people ages 66 and older.  The percentage of people who undergo cardiovascular procedures is higher among those with CKD than among those without CKD.   Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)   In 2013, the unadjusted rate of AKI hospitalizations in the Medicare population fell by 4.9 percent. This decrease was observed across all age and race groups.  For Medicare patients ages 66 and older with an AKI hospitalization in 2011, the cumulative probability of a recurrent AKI hospitalization within 2 years was 48 percent.  Among Medicare patients ages 66 and older with a first AKI hospitalization, the in-hospital mortality rate in 2013 was 9.5 percent (or 14.4 percent when including discharge to hospice), and less than half of all patients were discharged to their home.   Hospital discharge status of first AKI hospitalization for Medicare patients aged 66+, 2013     ESRD   After rising steadily from 1980 to 2001, the incidence rate of ESRD leveled off in the early 2000s and has declined slightly since 2006.  The number of incident (newly reported) ESRD cases in 2013 was 117,162; the unadjusted incidence rate was 363 per million/year.  Although the number of ESRD incident cases plateaued in 2010, the number of ESRD prevalent cases continues to rise by about 21,000 cases per year.  African-Americans are about 3.5 times more likely to develop ESRD than Caucasians.  Hispanics are about 1.5 times more likely to develop ESRD than non-Hispanics.  In 2013, 88.2 percent of all incident cases began renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis, 9.0 percent started with peritoneal dialysis, and 2.6 percent received a preemptive kidney transplant.  As of December 31, 2013, 63.7 percent of all prevalent ESRD cases were receiving hemodialysis therapy, 6.8 percent were being treated with peritoneal dialysis, and 29.2 percent had a functioning kidney transplant.  The leading causes of ESRD in children during 2009-2013 were: cystic/hereditary/congenital disorders (33.0 percent), glomerular disease (24.6 percent), and secondary causes of glomerulonephritis (12.9. percent).  A total of 1,462 children in the United States began ESRD care in 2013, and 9,921 children were treated for ESRD on December 31, 2013. The most common initial ESRD treatment modality among children overall was hemodialysis (56 percent).  The number of children listed for incident and repeat kidney transplant was 1,277 in 2013.   Kidney Transplants   17,600 kidney transplants were performed in the United States in 2013.  Less than one-third of the transplanted kidneys were from living donors in 2013.  From 2012 to 2013, there was a 3.1 percent increase in the cumulative number of recipients with a functioning kidney transplant.  Among candidates newly wait-listed for either a first-time or repeat kidney-alone transplant in 2009, the median waiting time to transplant was 3.6 years.  The number of deceased donors increased significantly since 2003, reaching 8,021 in 2013.  The rate of deceased donors among African Americans more than doubled from 1999 to 2013.  In 2012, the probability of 1-year graft survival was 92 percent and 97 percent for deceased and living donor kidney transplant recipients, respectively.  The probability of patient survival within 1 year post-transplant was 95 percent and 98 percent in deceased and living donor kidney transplant recipients, respectively, in 2012.  Since 1996, the probabilities of graft survival and patient survival have steadily improved among recipients of both living and deceased donor kidney transplants.   Morbidity   A notable decrease in hospitalization rates occurred from 2012 to 2013. Rates decreased by 11 percent for CKD patients and by 10.1 percent for those without CKD. However, rates of both overall and cause-specific admissions increased with advancing stages of CKD.  Hospitalizations increased among CKD patients with the presence of diabetes and CVD.  Among hemodialysis patients, the overall number of hospitalizations for ESRD in 2013 was 1.7 admissions per patient year—down from 2.1 in 2005.  Rates of readmission for CKD patients were higher than those for patients without CKD. In 2013, 22.3 percent of patients with CKD were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, compared to only 15.8 percent of those without CKD.   Adjusted percentage of patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, among Medicare CKD patients aged 66+, discharged alive from an all-cause index hospitalization between January 1 and December 1, by year, 2001-2013    Mortality   In 2013, adjusted mortality rates remained higher for Medicare patients with CKD (117.9/1,000) than for those without CKD (47.5/1,000); and these rates increased with CKD severity, although this gap narrowed during the period 2001 to 2013.  Male patients had slightly higher mortality rates (52.6/1,000) than females (43.4/1,000); this was more prevalent among those with CKD (males: 128.7/1,000; females: 110.0/1,000).  Mortality rates continue to decrease for dialysis and transplant patients, having fallen by 28 percent and 40 percent, respectively, since 1996.  CVD contributes to more than half of all deaths among patients with ESRD. Arrhythmias and cardiac arrest alone were responsible for more than one-third (37 percent) of CVD deaths.   Causes of death in ESRD patients, 2012-2014   Abbreviations: AMI, acute myocardial infarction; ASHD, atherosclerotic heart disease; CHF, congestive heart failure; CVA, cerebrovascular accident   Overall, the rates of death among Medicare patients with CKD are declining; however, they are higher in patients with CKD than without CKD.  The presence of diabetes and CVD along with CKD increases the risk of death.   All-cause mortality rates (per 1,000 patient years at risk) for Medicare patients aged 66+, by CKD status and year, 2001-2013 (adjusted)    Medicare Spending for CKD   Medicare spending for patients with CKD ages 65 and older exceeded $50 billion in 2013 and represented 20 percent of all Medicare spending in this age group.  More than 70 percent of Medicare spending for CKD patients ages 65 and older was incurred by those who also had diabetes, congestive heart failure, or both.  Although spending was 12.7 percent higher for African Americans than Caucasians in 2013, this represented a reduction from the 19.6 percent gap that occurred in 2010.  Spending was more than twice as high for patients with all three chronic conditions of CKD, diabetes, and congestive heart failure ($38,230) than in patients with only CKD ($15,614).  Medicare fee-for-service spending for ESRD beneficiaries rose by 1.6 percent, from $30.4 billion in 2012 to $30.9 billion in 2013, accounting for 7.1 percent of the overall Medicare paid claims costs.

Studying the genes of families that have more kidney disease is just one of the research areas supported by the National Kidney Foundation. One recent research project looked at how genes affect the causes of kidney disease. “My grandfather had hypertension for 45 years,” reported Dr. Sun Woo Kang, a South Korean–born nephrologist and researcher. “My father has had diabetes and hypertension for 25 years. He also had heart bypass surgery. Then, it was recently discovered that I had certain precursors for cardiovascular or kidney disease similar to my father, and my father’s father. I became even more interested in human genetics as it relates to cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.” Dr Kang is working long hours in the laboratory at the Center for Human Genetics and Genomics at the University of California at San Diego. Dr Kang’s research is funded with a National Kidney Foundation Fellowship. He is testing blood samples and DNA of patients with kidney failure, who volunteered because they were on dialysis at one of three Southern California medical centers. It is hoped this will help him discover if any genetic factors exist when it comes to cardiovascular and kidney disease. “Of people suffering from hypertension, there is a small group that is genetically at a high risk of developing hypertensive kidney disease,” he says. “I’m here to find out why and to help them.” That group, Dr. Kang adds, would get more intensive treatment, shown to reduce the onset of this disease. Since kidney disease can affect some families more than others, Dr. Kang is one of many researchers who are looking for genes by collecting blood samples from people with CKD and their families. Then, they compare the genes in those with kidney disease to a group of individuals who do not have kidney disease. Understanding the causes of kidney disease could lead to new ways to treat these medical problems. In addition, knowing which people carry kidney disease genes will allow doctors to find people at risk earlier. If they know who is at risk for developing kidney disease, they may know who could benefit most from early treatment and more frequent doctor visits. What should you do if you have a number of family members with diabetes, hypertension or other causes of kidney disease? If you have diabetes and have a brother, sister or parent with diabetic kidney disease, the chance that you will have kidney disease during is higher. Genes might be part of the reason that African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Native American or Native Alaskan people have higher risks. If you have diabetes but do not have a relative with diabetic kidney disease, you have a lower chance of having diabetic kidney disease over the course of your lifetime. What can you do if you have a family history of kidney problems? Family members of those with kidney disease should tell their doctors, so they can learn if they need to be screened for kidney disease. Experts say that if one member of a family has kidney failure, all blood relatives over the age of 18 should be tested for kidney problems. Tell the doctor your family health history. It is especially important for the doctor to know: You have a blood relative who has or had kidney failure (and the cause of the kidney failure, if you know it). About health problems that put you at risk for kidney failure (including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney infections, kidney stones, and prostate problems, for example). Attend a kidney screening program sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation. Look for screenings in your area at www.kidney.org . What can you do if you have a family history of heart problems? Like diabetes and hypertension, family history is a strong predictor of having heart disease in the general population. And, heart disease is a strong predictor of chronic kidney disease. Family history is one way physicians who treat families can look more closely for certain diseases. If someone in your family has heart disease, you should talk to your doctor about being tested for kidney disease. What should you do if you know your family has an inherited kidney disease? You should tell your doctor about your family history. Two rare types of kidney disease are known to be inherited: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD). PKD usually refers to a genetic or inherited disease that is sometimes called “adult PKD” because it normally appears in adult life. A less common type of PKD occurs primarily in babies and children. In PKD, cysts, or fluid–filled pouches, are found primarily in the kidney but they can also affect other organs, including the liver, pancreas, spleen. The adult type of PKD (also called autosomal dominant PKD or ADPKD) is passed from parent to child by an autosomal dominant type of inheritance. This means that only one copy of the abnormal gene is needed to cause the disease. Therefore, if one parent has the disease, each child has a 50–50 chance of developing the disease. Fabry disease is an inherited disorder that causes many different symptoms from mild to severe and life–threatening. The kidneys are one of the major organs affected by Fabry disease. Kidney failure may occur in some people who have Fabry disease. Good news for families at risk was reported in 2010. A team of researchers from the United States and Europe found more than a dozen genes that may play a role in common forms of kidney disease. The team looked at the DNA sequences in more than 65,000 people. Common variations in several genes were found to be more common among people with chronic kidney disease than in those with normal kidney function. Researchers hope these results will explain how and why kidney disease clusters in some families.

Kidney disease is significantly underdiagnosed and excessive protein in the urine (albuminuria) is one of the earliest signs of kidney damage. Usually invisible to the human eye, often this red flag for kidney disease is undetected because not enough people who are at risk are receiving urine testing.  Take the National Kidney Foundation's Quick Kidney Risk Check to find out if you're at risk for kidney disease--and what steps you can take to reduce your risk.  This quiz was based on a study by Paul Muntner, PhD and was originally published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation.

To find out how well your kidneys are doing, we measure the quantity of waste that circulates in your blood.     This is a test used to check how well the kidneys are working by estimating how much waste is in your blood. The more waste products in your blood the lower the filtration rate.           Causes     The two main causes of CKD are diabetes and hypertension, which are responsible for up to two-thirds of all cases.  Immune and inherited causes, as well as other reasons, are responsible for the rest.                   North Americans have CKD and more than 26 million have some form of the disease.         North Americans over the age of 65 have some form of CKD.         North Americans with kidney failure are currently awaiting kidney transplants.             Kidney Failure Risk Equation  Using the patient's Urine, Sex, Age and GFR, the kidney failure risk equation provides the 2 and 5 year probability of treated kidney failure for a potential patient with CKD stage 3 to 5.         The equation has been validated in more than 30 countries worldwide, making it the most accurate and efficient way of finding out the patient's risk.               What's your risk of kidney failure?  Use the Kidney Failure Risk Equation to determine 2 and 5 year probability of treated kidney failure (dialysis or transplantation) for a patient with CKD stage 3 to 5.

The four and eight variable equations accurately predict the 2 and 5 year probability of treated kidney failure (dialysis or transplantation) for a potential patient with CKD Stage 3 to 5. Predicted risks may differ from observed risks in clinical populations with lower and higher observed risks than the study population, and a calibration factor for non-North American cohorts has been added.  Determining the probability of kidney failure may be useful for patient and provider communication, triage and management of nephrology referrals and timing of dialysis access placement and living related kidney transplant. Prospective trials evaluating the utility of this instrument for clinical decision making are in progress.  References    Tangri N, Stevens LA, Griffith J, et al.

at risk?     See page en Español               Anyone can get kidney disease, but some things can make it more likely to happen to you. In fact, 1 in 3 adults in the United States are at risk for getting kidney disease.  Kidney disease is most often caused by diabetes or high blood pressure. Both of these health problems can cause permanent damage to your kidneys. When your kidneys have been permanently damaged and aren't working as well as they should, it's called chronic kidney disease (CKD), or kidney disease for short.  Diabetes and high blood pressure aren't the only things that can cause kidney disease. Other common risk factors for kidney disease include:   Heart (cardiovascular) disease  Having a family member who had kidney disease  Being African-American, Asian, Native American or Hispanic  Being over age 60 If you are at risk for kidney disease, ask your doctor how often you should be tested.   If you catch and treat kidney disease early, you may be able to prevent it from getting worse!     Diabetes  High blood pressure (hypertension)  Family history  Age  Race/ethnicity  Other causes   Diabetes  Over 29 million people in the United States have diabetes. Diabetes is the #1 cause of kidney failure. A special diet, exercise and medicines can help manage diabetes and prevent complications, but some people with diabetes may still develop kidney disease, even with good medical care. Learn more about diabetes.  Return to top  High blood pressure (hypertension)  High blood pressure is the #2 cause of kidney failure. High blood pressure can be both a cause of kidney disease, and a symptom of it because healthy kidneys help regulate your blood pressure. Keeping your blood pressure under control can help prevent kidney disease, or help keep it from getting worse. Learn more about High blood pressure (hypertension) .  Return to top  Family history  Knowing your family health history provides you with important information about your risk for disease. If you know you are at risk for kidney disease, you can take steps to protect your health. To be at risk means it is more likely you will get kidney disease.  Return to top  Age  Being over age 60 increases your risk for kidney disease.  Over time, the kidneys lose some function naturally. People who are over 60 are also at more likely to have diabetes and high blood pressure, the two leading causes of kidney failure.  If you are over age 60, ask your doctor how often you should be tested for signs of kidney disease.  Return to top  Race/ethnicity  African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans and Asian-Americans are more likely to have kidney disease. Doctors and researchers are not exactly sure why these groups are more at risk for kidney disease. It may be because these groups tend to have higher rates of diabetes and high blood pressure, the two leading causes of kidney failure. Access to health care and other factors may also contribute. Learn more about race and ethnicity's link to kidney disease.  Return to top  Other causes  Although diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of kidney disease, other diseases and conditions can also lead to kidney disease and kidney failure. Some examples of other causes of kidney failure include:   Polycystic kidney disease : a genetic disease that causes many cysts to grow in the kidneys.  Glomerulonephritis : a disease causing irritation to the tiny filters (glomeruli) in your kidneys.  Acute kidney injury : kidney failure that happens very quickly, often because of injuries, major blood loss or some reactions to medicines.  Autoimmune diseases (such as lupus and IgA nephropathy ): diseases in which your immune system attacks your own body.  Kidney cancer : cancer that grows inside your kidneys.   Having one of these conditions does not always mean that you will have kidney failure. Talk to your doctor about how to prevent kidney failure as part of your care for your condition.

International guidelines adopted in 2012 make it seem that way. They define the disease in terms of how efficiently kidneys filter the waste from our blood, a measure called the glomerular filtration rate. Healthy young people commonly have G.F.R.s of about 120. A G.F.R. lower than 60 or another marker of kidney damage (such as protein in the urine) for more than three months means chronic kidney disease. At which point, patients become scared. “When you’re told you have a disease, that’s a bad day,” said Dr. Ann O’Hare, a nephrologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who specializes in treating older adults. “Patients worry about dialysis, because that’s what they associate with kidney disease.” Chronic kidney disease causes no symptoms until its later stages, and most seniors with the diagnosis are told they’re at Stage 3, of five — sudden, unwelcome news. Because Medicare uses these benchmarks for billing and reimbursement, they’ve become, in effect, the official definition of the disease for older Americans. But wait a minute. Kidney function declines with age in almost everyone, and the proportion of older people with G.F.R. readings below 60 approaches 50 percent, studies have found. As the older adult population grows, the prevalence may rise even higher.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Yet the proportion of older people who will ever reach kidney failure, and thus need dialysis or a transplant, remains very low. People don’t turn to dialysis until their G.F.R. sinks much further, to about 10. In the great majority of older adults, that will never happen. The lifetime risk of kidney failure in the United States is 3.6 percent for whites and 8 percent for African-Americans, one widely cited study found. “Probably a majority of older patients we see have some degree of impaired renal function,” said Dr. Michael Steinman, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. “The chances are far and away that they’ll die of something else, and their kidneys will never be a problem.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   “Why are we even thinking about this as a disease?” Indeed, a small but spirited cadre of physicians and researchers are arguing — most recently in JAMA — that the guidelines should be recalibrated by age . By using the same standards for everyone, “We’re labeling and medicalizing and victimizing a substantial fraction of the elderly population,” said Dr. Richard Glassock, an author of the article and a nephrologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Instead, Dr. Glassock and others propose that in people older than 65, the diagnosis should require a G.F.R. reading less than 45. At that lower threshold, they estimate, a third to half of the chronic kidney disease diagnosed in older patients would suddenly disappear. These patients should just be considered … old, the researchers say, with lower kidney function normal for their ages. Age figures in the diagnostic criteria for some diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or osteoporosis. But doctors diagnosing other conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, use the same benchmarks for everyone. When it comes to kidney decline, Dr. O’Hare said, a G.F.R. below 60 would cause great concern in a 20-year-old. At older ages, “it’s a gray zone.” Most G.F.R. readings that fall below 60 in older adults remain in the 45 to 59 range, considered a modest reduction in kidney function. Most of these seniors will not have protein in their urine or other evidence of kidney damage. “People are being told they have a condition and it doesn’t really mean anything,” Dr. O’Hare said. In the same JAMA issue, though, another group of physician researchers warned against changing the guidelines .

They point out that although the relative risk of dying is actually higher in younger people with chronic kidney disease, the absolute risk — the numbers of people who die from it — is higher at older ages . Moreover, they argue, an older person with low G.F.R. and protein in his urine (called proteinuria or albuminuria) can take some steps to reduce the risk of eventual kidney failure, even if that’s already extremely low. Certain blood pressure medications with tongue-tangling names may protect the kidneys, for instance, though their effect on older adults is also a matter of debate . A diagnosis can also help patients avoid drugs that can harm kidneys, said Dr. Levey and a co-author, Dr. Josef Coresh, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (Both were part of the working group that developed the guidelines.) Doctors can modify medication dosages and warn older patients away from drugs that can impair kidney function, like ibuprofen, certain injected antibiotics, and the contrast dyes used in CT scans. Generally, though, what a doctor tells an older patient found to have chronic kidney disease is fairly standard counsel: Control your blood pressure, which exacerbates kidney disease and vice versa, and your cholesterol. Manage your diabetes. Keep track of drugs. “That’s just sensible, healthy living, whether you have kidney disease or not,” Dr. Glassock said. So he questions whether we should even call somewhat reduced kidney function at older ages a disease. It may amount to more than semantics. Along with fears of sitting in a dialysis center three days a week for the rest of one’s life come the costs of additional tests, appointments and referrals to specialists. “It pulls people into further engagement with the health care system,” Dr. O’Hare said. Most older adults face plenty of that already. Still, here’s the reality: Revising the international guidelines, a protracted and complicated undertaking, doesn’t appear to be in the cards. The definition we have is the one we’re going to have for years, maybe for good. Many older people are likely at some point to hear a physician say they have chronic kidney disease. How should they respond? No special screening is required to learn one’s glomerular filtration rate. It’s part of the common basic metabolic panel. Most of us have it in our records somewhere.

Doctors need to put these numbers in perspective, to explain that kidneys age with the rest of us. It makes sense to repeat the test to see if the G.F.R. remains stable or continues to fall; it also makes sense to test the urine for protein. Physicians can use risk predictors —some exist, more are coming — to help determine an individual’s odds of kidney failure. That way, Dr. Levey said, “we’re identifying the patients at risk for the worst outcomes and reassuring the others.”   But reassurance should be by far the more common response, whether a physician uses the D-word or not. “I don’t think this is something to lose sleep over,” Dr. O’Hare tells patients with modestly lower but stable G.F.R., and no other indications of kidney damage. “That’s often a huge relief.”   A version of this article appears in print on September 15, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: A Diagnosis of Dubious Meaning.

Dialysis is a treatment that removes wastes and excess fluid from your blood.  If I have kidney disease, will I need dialysis?  In the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) , you do not need dialysis. The stages of chronic kidney disease can last for many years. But if your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant to keep you alive.    When should I start dialysis?  National Kidney Foundation guidelines recommend you start dialysis when your kidney function drops to 15% or less — or if you have severe symptoms caused by your kidney disease, such as: shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea or vomiting. Your doctor will help you decide when to start dialysis, based on results of lab tests that measure how much kidney function you have left and on your symptoms.  Private insurance generally covers treatment for kidney failure whenever your doctor says it is needed. If you don’t have private insurance, you may be able to get coverage through federal or state funded health care programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid.  Most people (about 93% of those who apply) qualify for Medicare when they need dialysis or a transplant, even if they are under age 65. Medicare pays for 80% of treatment costs of kidney disease when kidney function has dropped to 10 – 15%, or when your doctor justifies it.  If you are not having symptoms, you may be able to wait a bit longer before you begin dialysis. However, some doctors believe that starting dialysis as soon as Medicare or insurance covers it is wise, since it can take a long time to recover if you let yourself get very ill. Since chronic kidney failure often happens slowly, sometimes people do not even know how bad they feel, until they start dialysis and begin to feel much better.  It is important to start getting ready for dialysis or a transplant well in advance — when your kidney disease reaches Stage 4 (severe, with glomerular filtration rate , or GFR, less than 30 mL/min). Learning about the types of dialysis and transplant options will help you make a choice that is best for you. Any type of dialysis will require surgery — usually outpatient — to allow access for your treatments, and this should be done well in advance to allow time for healing.  Who pays for dialysis?  Dialysis is paid for with your health insurance and Medicare (even if you are under age 65). If you have an employer group health plan, it will pay first for 30 – 33 months, and Medicare will be secondary (paying some or all of the balance your insurance doesn’t cover). After 30 – 33 months, Medicare pays first and your health plan is secondary.  Ask your dialysis or transplant center to help you figure out what your insurance will pay and how much you will be expected to pay out-of-pocket. You can also call DaVita Guest Services at 1-800-244-0680 from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. (PT).  Once I am on dialysis, will my kidneys get better?  The chances that your kidneys will get better depend on what caused your kidney failure. Kidney failure is divided into two general categories, acute and chronic. Acute (or sudden) kidney failure is often temporary. In chronic kidney failure, the kidneys normally do not heal.  In acute kidney failure , when kidneys stop functioning due to a sudden stress, kidney function may recover. But when the damage to your kidneys has been continuous and progressive over a number of years, as it is in chronic kidney disease (CKD), then the kidneys usually do not get better. When CKD has progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD) , it is considered irreversible.  Typical causes of acute (sudden) kidney failure are:   Insufficient blood supply to the kidneys  Obstructed urine flow  Reactions to allergens, toxic substances, or an acute autoimmune attack on the kidneys   Typical causes of chronic (gradual) kidney failure are:   Type I and Type II diabetes  High blood pressure  Glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli, the tiny clusters of blood vessels that filter your blood)  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)  Long-term autoimmune attack on the kidneys  Prolonged urinary tract obstruction   If your chronic kidney disease was not diagnosed until you were at the point of needing dialysis or a transplant, then it may seem sudden to you. However, the gradual injuries to your kidneys that occurred over a number of years caused permanent damage.  If you have acute kidney failure, you may need dialysis for only a few days or weeks while your kidneys recover. If your kidneys are too badly damaged to recover their function, then you will need long-term dialysis or a kidney transplant to live.  If it seems that your kidneys are recovering, talk to your doctor to learn whether it could be true. Tests can be done to determine whether your kidney function has improved.
