I miscarried for a second time about 2 months ago at about 9 weeks. I had no pregnancy symptoms whatsoevern. I also miscarried many years ago and had extreme fatique and nausea. This pregnancy turned out to be a molar pregnancy. I am experiencing no symptoms yet again, and am feeling a great deal of stress -- even though I am only just 4 weeks pregnant.

I'm 12 weeks now and only 2 weeks ago started feeling a little tired, but still nothing major and just now started to not fit it my clothes.                 mclynne&mctomm;    Answered 8/28/07                310 found this helpful     I am 8 weeks, and I had no symptoms until about 6 1/2 weeks.

With this pregnancy, I had no symptoms until almost 10 weeks. I never even skipped a perod, so the doctor ultrasounded me for a potential miscarriage and was shocked to see a whole happy, kicking baby. It can happen.                 Hollyberry1109    Answered 8/27/07               233 found this helpful     I'm at 29 weeks now, but I've had no pregnancy symptoms so far (other than the growing tummy). I didn't even know i was pregnant until I was about 2 months...even then only the ultrasound was proof that i was actually pregnant! Take it easy, listen to music, walk, write, etc, to ease the stress. Good luck!                 TwinkleBell311    Answered 8/27/07               211 found this helpful     Well, When I was 4 weeks pregnant I didn't feel any pregnancy symptoms. I started feeling then around my 6th week, I'm 3 months right now and it never went away yet! I think you should give yourself some time before you fully go nuts about it, you're only 4 weeks and you still have a long way to go. Always let your doctor know how you feel and he/she will give you all the answers you need.

She ordered blood work today. I miscarried 1st pregnancy at ten weeks (no nausea); had healthy baby after (lots of monring sickness around weeks 6 thru 8). They did an ultrasound at week 8 on my 2nd to make sure everything was ok. That helped to ease my mind a lot. I think you would be completely justified in calling your doctor--state your concerns and why, and see if they can do some tests to help put your mind at ease. Your concerns are valid. That said, a lot of women don't even know they are prego at 4 weeks, which means a lot of them have no symptoms this early, so hopefully that is a bit reassuring. Here's to nauseau for both of us SOON!! Good luck!

I don't have my first Dr.'s appt until I'm 10 weeks. The only thing I have noticed is peeing alot (but that's b/c I have been trying to drink lots of water) and I wake up every morning with this nervous/anxious feeling. I also haven't had much of an appetite. I'm really worried that I am not really pregnant b/c I haven't had symptoms yet. I feel like I'm driving myself crazy worrying about it.

The BabyCenter Editorial Team          Mom Answers ( 642 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   I am six weeks and have not had much in the way of symptoms either. All I have noticed is some mild cramps every once in a while, and a little bit of fatigue, bloating and gas. Seems like symptoms come and go too, so every day can be different. Sometimes I don't feel like I'm pregnant, and other days I do. It is normal, so don't worry yourself.

So even though I had 3 positive tests, I was getting worried because I don't have the sore breasts like I did with my first pregnancy. Thanks to eveyone :)                 areesing    Answered 10/29/07               208 found this helpful     That's not strange at all. Everyone's pregnancy is different and no two pregnancy's are alike. My first, no morning sickness. I felt great other than occasional dizzyness and irritability. This time, I am constantly sick to my stomach. I also noticed that I too started to drink much more water than normal early on. I thought it was because I wanted to. I now realize it was because my body needed it. If you had a blood test come back positive, and you aren't spotting, then you definately are pregnant. If you start to spot, brown or pink, call you dr immediately and make an appt to go in earlier than 10 weeks. It most likely wouldn't be anything to worry about, but your dr would want you to call.

All was fine then, they saw a heartbeat and i have my 12 week scan booked for Jan 8th. However, ever since week 7 when my really sore boobs went away, i still have absolutely NO symptoms AT ALL. Believe me I am not complaining as I know how some of you girls have had a nightmare with sickness etc... I have nothing though. No sickness/nausea, no frequent trips to the loo, no sore boobs, no cravings or food aversions.... I feel absolutely normal and if I had never done the test or had the scans (due to pain in my side) I would not even think I was pregnant. Is it possible for something to have happened to the baby? I haven't had any bleeding. My Midwife is off until the New Year and then only returns my calls after 2 days. I don't want to go to hospital as I feel like i would be wasting resources etc as I feel fine. That's the problem though!! Any body else going through the same and had no symptoms at all throughout?? Not even fromt he start?

No sickness, no trips to the loo, no sore boobs etc.... & like you if Ihadnt done a test wouldnt have thought I was pregnant so it is possible not to have all these symptoms & still be pregnant. If youre really concerned though, dont feel as if youre wasting resources by contacting your local early pregnancy unit.

I really haven't had many symptoms although my boobs have grown -but could be down to putting on weight over xmas! Im not even sure how far along i am-13 weeks since lastperiod but due to long cylces i think i am about 11.  Good news is i have my scan tomorrow so will (hopefully) get to see baby and then i might finally believe i am pg!  Do you have a date for your scan? i guess yours must be soon too so that will help to reassure you.

I had no symptoms and I was concerned there was something wrong, particularly as I had a missed MC earlier this year with my first pg (and had no sickness then either).  I stocked up on ginger biscuits and ginger tea for the sickness that never came! I did however have larger than normal nipples in the first trimester which was my only sign!  I checked them every morning and night and they were still big throughout.  I'm now 31 weeks and definitely pg!!  Oh actually, I was constipated too (TMI soz) which is from all the hormones apparently.  Have you noticed anything like this? The early scans are a really positive sign.  Good luck!

It is totally possible to have no symptoms at all, my mum had one with me, she didn't even know she was pregnant until 24 weeks when she had weird stomach feelings, went to the dr's and they said erm that's your baby! A positive early scan is a really good sign, I had 2 in the first trimester cos I was constantly bleeding and they helped reassure me...for a while anyway!

I know how you feel though, last time round all my pregnancy symptoms disappeared about two weeks before my dating scan and I was convinced I had imagined the whole thing.

I'm sure this has been discussed millions of times but I'm new and sending myself a little bit crazy. My husband and I started trying for a baby on our wedding night (26th June) and did loads of BD on our honeymoon, when I should have been ovulating.  I'm now on day 26 of my cycle and I don't think I'm pregnant because I've got no breast tenderness at all. I'm trying to manage my expactations because I don't want to be absolutely crushed when I get my period.  I know it's early days in our TTC but I have been broody for 10 years and I'm quite impatient! Am I safe to assume that no breast tenderness means that I'm definitely not pregnant?  I have been peeing a lot and I thought I had a bit of nausea but I could have been imagining that. Thanks! xx       Helpful    0    Report      Reply              TulipRose  16/07/2010 at 09:24     PM      Hi Hon, From what I have read it is quite common when pg but it doesn't happen to everyone and especialy not so early.  So it may not mean anything. Unfortunately in ttc everything feels the same and is confusing. AF feels like a period, implantation feels like a period, ovulation feels like cramps and we all work differently. Bit of a waiting game I think. Sorry!  I know this sucks! x       Helpful    0    Report      Reply              MrsKP_  16/07/2010 at 10:30     PM      Hey, I'm GC but just wanted to say that I had no symptoms at all until about 6 weeks, no breast tenderness etc, I was shocked when I got my BFP as I hadn't expected it at all. Even at 6 weeks I didn't really get any symptoms, I got a bit hungry and got slightly tender breasts at about 6/7 weeks but that was it - everyone is really very different! Good luck!

Oh well, you never know then.  I don't feel pregnant so I'm fully expecting to get AF in a few days. Mooker - my cycles vary, they seem to average at about 29 days so that would be Monday/Tuesday coming I think.  I usually get some pre AF spotting by about now though and I haven't got that this month.  Who know's what's going on.  I'll just have to try to be patient. I've actually just ordered some ovulation strips from amazon.  I think it'll make me feel a lot better to at least know exactly when I'm ovulating.

Signs & Symptoms       Pregnancy Tests        It is not uncommon to think about pregnancy as an endless onslaught of symptoms ranging from morning sickness and heartburn to food cravings and breast tenderness . While many women do experience these and other symptoms, there are those who never feel particularly ill during the entire course of their pregnancy. But does this necessarily mean that everything is okay? Or should the lack of symptoms be more a cause for concern than celebration?         Frequency and Severity of Symptoms Just as the types of pregnancy symptoms can vary from woman to woman, so, too, can their severity. In the end, pregnancy is simply an individual experience with its ​own feature and challenges. As such, neither the type nor severity of symptoms can ever be considered more or less "normal” than the other. The same applies to the frequency of symptoms. From day to day and week to week, what you experience can change frequently. There will be days when you may experience cramping or frequent urination and others when you’ll have constipation or mood swings. There may even be days when you feel perfectly fine with no symptoms at all. If present, most pregnancy symptoms will begin on or around the fourth week of pregnancy. Some of the more overt physical manifestations (such as acne, weight gain, and breast and nipple change) tend to occur between the ninth and eleventh weeks.   By the second trimester , many of the more profound symptoms of pregnancy will begin to subside. while others will continue right up until the moment of delivery. Complete Absence of Pregnancy Symptoms An impromptu search of the internet will reveal a plethora of postings from women who have reported no symptoms during part of all of the first trimester.         Many seem clearly elated by this. Others feel just the opposite, often worrying if this is a sign of a less healthy baby or a pregnancy that may end in miscarriage . Most of these fears are unfounded. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the lack of symptoms places the baby at any risk of either low birth weight, preterm birth , or spontaneous miscarriage. There are, however, two situations that warrant concern. Both relate not so much to the absence of symptoms but rather a change in symptoms that occur suddenly and without explanation: Chief among these are changes in fetal movement . Any decrease in movement, or a complete cessation of movement, may be the sign of an impending pregnancy loss. While some symptoms tend to decrease as the pregnancy progresses, the movement of your baby should not. There may be days when your baby will be quieter, but if movement suddenly stops (or shifts from a lot of activity to a little), you should see your doctor immediately and have it checked out. Just as worrisome is the sudden disappearance of symptoms . We’re not referring to women who have had no symptoms of pregnancy. Rather, we’re concerned about those who have had symptoms and now suddenly have none. The sudden cessation may be the sign of a miscarriage and developmental problem, especially during the first trimester. Even if there are no other symptoms of miscarriage , it is important to have it checked out as soon as possible.         Source: Gabbe, S.; Niebyl, J.; Simpson, J. et al.

It's Possible — Here's How  1 week ago        by Lisa Rabasca Roepe      Lisa Rabasca Roepe often writes about three the things she loves most -- parenting, food and drink, and pop culture. Her parenting essays have been published in Scary Mommys Club Mid, Yahoo Parenting, Womens Day and Mommyish.com.   View Profile              Image: Rawpixel/Getty Images   Print  Yes, you can be pregnant & have zero symptoms    Share    Tweet    Pin    Share    Tumble            Combined comments & shares on social media          When we read the headlines about people who unexpectedly give birth and claim they never even knew they were pregnant, those of us who had morning sickness, extreme fatigue or weight gain during our pregnancies often shake our heads in disbelief. Surely you can't be pregnant with no symptoms? How could these people not notice?  Yet doctors say there are many reasons someone might not notice they're pregnant.  "We as human beings have a powerful denial factor," says Dr. Dan Frayne, assistant residency director of the Mountain Area Health Education Center 's Family Medicine Residency Program in Asheville, North Carolina, and cochair of the National Preconception Health and Health Care Initiative . "You can be in denial and neglect to see the changes to your body for a fairly long time. Some women who are overweight might not see a huge change in their body, and if you are skinny, you might not show until 20 weeks."  Denial of pregnancy is more common than expected according to a study in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine . Researchers found that 1 in 475 women may not realize they're pregnant until 20 weeks' gestation, and 1 in 2,500 women make it right up to delivery before finding out (a rate similar to that of eclampsia).  More: 7 Key C-Section Recovery Tips — From Scar Care to Diet  Frayne outlined four types of people who might neglect to notice pregnancy symptoms.  Young teens  It’s not uncommon for a young teenager to be relatively unaware of their body and the changes that occur during pregnancy, Frayne says. Plus, many teens have irregular periods, so missing a period for six months might not be unusual. Frayne explains that sometimes, young teens will seek medical care for abdominal or back pain at 30 or 32 weeks, and when they're told they are pregnant, they'll often admit they suspected as much but were afraid to tell anyone.  Pregnant people who are busy  Plenty of people, particularly women, have competing demands in their lives — children, family, work — that make it difficult for them to pay any attention to themselves and their own bodies, Frayne says. Sometimes, it takes time for them to either recognize the changes or decide they want to see a doctor.  People with addiction  People struggling with an addiction or those who otherwise abuse substances often won't notice they're pregnant simply because it's not a primary concern for them, Frayne explains.  People who believe they don't need prenatal care  Sometimes, someone who has either been pregnant before or who believes they already know what to do about a potential pregnancy skips out on doctor visits and thus misses pregnancy indications, Frayne says.  More:  The Real Cost of Fertility Treatments & Adoption  One of the underlying causes for this denial, says Frayne, is that a little less than half of U.S. pregnancies are unplanned or unwanted. For example, according to a study published in 2011 , in 2006, 49 percent of pregnancies were unintended — a slight increase from 48 percent in 2001. But while many pregnant people are indeed in denial, when they finally do seek medical advice and the pregnancy is confirmed, the majority of them aren't surprised. "In many cases, they are being told something they knew and suspected but didn’t want to admit," Frayne adds.  Unfortunately, this lack of awareness can put both mother and child at risk for complications during birth. The concern, says Frayne, is that prenatal care provides the best opportunity for a healthy pregnancy. It's important for a pregnant person to visit the doctor within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy, he says. Unfortunately, even when people know they are pregnant, they often don't visit their doctor early enough, largely because they lack health insurance and access to care.  And despite the fact that the U.S. spends more money on health care than any other country, we have one of the worst infant mortality rates compared with similar economically developed countries. According to the CDC, in 2015, over 23,000 infants died in the United States, with the infant mortality rate at 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.  The United States also has a rising maternal death rate . "The U.S. is the only developed country where more mothers are dying now than 10 to 20 years ago," Frayne says.  More:  The 15 Baby Necessities New Parents Actually Need  Why? The lack of affordable health care and health insurance is largely to blame. "Women of reproductive age aren’t as healthy as they used to be," Frayne says, noting that, in 2015, 43 percent of U.S. women of reproductive age have a medical condition, more than half are obese and 1 in 5 don’t have health insurance.  One question all health care providers should ask their patients is whether they want to become pregnant in the next year, Frayne says. Simply asking the question will encourage patients and doctors to discuss preconception and prenatal care. That's one step in the right direction — but the far bigger step is access to affordable care.  A version of this article was originally published in December 2015.

With this pregnancy, I had no symptoms until almost 10 weeks. I never even skipped a perod, so the doctor ultrasounded me for a potential miscarriage and was shocked to see a whole happy, kicking baby. It can happen.

I didn't even know i was pregnant until I was about 2 months...even then only the ultrasound was proof that i was actually pregnant! Take it easy, listen to music, walk, write, etc, to ease the stress. Good luck!                 TwinkleBell311    Answered 8/27/07               211 found this helpful     Well, When I was 4 weeks pregnant I didn't feel any pregnancy symptoms. I started feeling then around my 6th week, I'm 3 months right now and it never went away yet! I think you should give yourself some time before you fully go nuts about it, you're only 4 weeks and you still have a long way to go. Always let your doctor know how you feel and he/she will give you all the answers you need.

She ordered blood work today. I miscarried 1st pregnancy at ten weeks (no nausea); had healthy baby after (lots of monring sickness around weeks 6 thru 8). They did an ultrasound at week 8 on my 2nd to make sure everything was ok. That helped to ease my mind a lot. I think you would be completely justified in calling your doctor--state your concerns and why, and see if they can do some tests to help put your mind at ease. Your concerns are valid. That said, a lot of women don't even know they are prego at 4 weeks, which means a lot of them have no symptoms this early, so hopefully that is a bit reassuring. Here's to nauseau for both of us SOON!! Good luck!

I have had a blood pregnancy test that came back positive. I am six weeks pregnant (starting from the first day of my last period) and have had no noticeable symptoms. I don't have my first Dr.'s appt until I'm 10 weeks. The only thing I have noticed is peeing alot (but that's b/c I have been trying to drink lots of water) and I wake up every morning with this nervous/anxious feeling. I also haven't had much of an appetite. I'm really worried that I am not really pregnant b/c I haven't had symptoms yet. I feel like I'm driving myself crazy worrying about it. Is there anyone else out there like me??

Find out how early you may start to feel pregnancy symptoms and which signs of pregnancy tend to show up in the first few weeks.          The BabyCenter Editorial Team          Mom Answers ( 642 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   I am six weeks and have not had much in the way of symptoms either. All I have noticed is some mild cramps every once in a while, and a little bit of fatigue, bloating and gas. Seems like symptoms come and go too, so every day can be different. Sometimes I don't feel like I'm pregnant, and other days I do. It is normal, so don't worry yourself.                 Hopeful24gotBFP    Answered 12/3/07                227 found this helpful     I am also six weeks pregnant and have very few signs. I'm so glad that other people are feeling the same way. Some days I'm more tired than others and I have been peeing a lot, and also drinking more, and my boobs are little sore, but nothing more. I know I should be thankful but it makes me worried that something isn't right. I don't see the Dr for another 2 1/2 weeks!                 Delta1    Answered 9/11/07               219 found this helpful     I'm so glad I found this post....I too have no symptoms other than peeing a bit more than normal and maybe being a bit more tired. So even though I had 3 positive tests, I was getting worried because I don't have the sore breasts like I did with my first pregnancy. Thanks to eveyone :)                 areesing    Answered 10/29/07               208 found this helpful     That's not strange at all. Everyone's pregnancy is different and no two pregnancy's are alike. My first, no morning sickness. I felt great other than occasional dizzyness and irritability. This time, I am constantly sick to my stomach. I also noticed that I too started to drink much more water than normal early on. I thought it was because I wanted to. I now realize it was because my body needed it. If you had a blood test come back positive, and you aren't spotting, then you definately are pregnant. If you start to spot, brown or pink, call you dr immediately and make an appt to go in earlier than 10 weeks. It most likely wouldn't be anything to worry about, but your dr would want you to call.                 Emotional 1    Answered 9/2/07               196 found this helpful     I am just over 6 weeks and have had very few symptoms. I had a postive preg. test at home and still wasn't sure until the ultrasound. I felt great actually with the exception of tender/sore breasts, using the bathroom alot (very thirsty). Just wait though, in just the last two days, I have become very emotional and quick tempered something very unusual for me. Count your blessings is what everyone keeps telling me. No morning sickness is good so I hear.. Keep feeling good, it's good for you, the baby, and your spouse!!!!                 babynumberone5808    Answered 9/17/07               99 found this helpful     I am the exact same way! If you are unsure, go to the dr. and get a blood preg. test-it is 100% accurate. However, I am sure you are pregnant, give it time. Even a few days your body may change dramatically. I am 6 weeks along, three days ago I didn't have any symptoms, today...sore breasts, EXTREME fatigue and going to the br all the time!! Your symptoms will come, enjoy this time!                 jmlccl    Answered 9/13/07               87 found this helpful     During my 1st pregnancy, I realized I was preggo because my breasts were sooooo sore (esp in shower!) and I was nauseous all the time from week 7 thru week 13. Now I'm about 6 weeks preggo and only peeing a lot. No sore breasts, no nauseau.. Ultrasound on Thursday should ease my fears (had an early miscarriage at 5 weeks in August and got preggo right after)                 vbutterfly3    Answered 10/1/07               82 found this helpful     absoultely, I'm 7 weeks and I don't have any symptoms either...

Other than frequent trips to the bathroom and sore breasts I am not experiencing anything! I was wondering if I was really pregnant. I had some cramping and called the doctor. They had me go in and gave me an ultrasound. Sure enough, there is a baby there! We are lucky! Also, blood tests are extremely accurate so you should definitely stop worrying!                 sunshine_76    Answered 9/7/07               75 found this helpful     I'm going through the exact same thing, although I noticed my breast are starting to feel sore when not wearing support.

All was fine then, they saw a heartbeat and i have my 12 week scan booked for Jan 8th. However, ever since week 7 when my really sore boobs went away, i still have absolutely NO symptoms AT ALL. Believe me I am not complaining as I know how some of you girls have had a nightmare with sickness etc... I have nothing though. No sickness/nausea, no frequent trips to the loo, no sore boobs, no cravings or food aversions.... I feel absolutely normal and if I had never done the test or had the scans (due to pain in my side) I would not even think I was pregnant. Is it possible for something to have happened to the baby? I haven't had any bleeding. My Midwife is off until the New Year and then only returns my calls after 2 days. I don't want to go to hospital as I feel like i would be wasting resources etc as I feel fine. That's the problem though!! Any body else going through the same and had no symptoms at all throughout?? Not even fromt he start?

No sickness, no trips to the loo, no sore boobs etc.... & like you if Ihadnt done a test wouldnt have thought I was pregnant so it is possible not to have all these symptoms & still be pregnant.

I had no symptoms and I was concerned there was something wrong, particularly as I had a missed MC earlier this year with my first pg (and had no sickness then either).  I stocked up on ginger biscuits and ginger tea for the sickness that never came! I did however have larger than normal nipples in the first trimester which was my only sign!  I checked them every morning and night and they were still big throughout.  I'm now 31 weeks and definitely pg!!  Oh actually, I was constipated too (TMI soz) which is from all the hormones apparently.  Have you noticed anything like this? The early scans are a really positive sign.  Good luck!

It is totally possible to have no symptoms at all, my mum had one with me, she didn't even know she was pregnant until 24 weeks when she had weird stomach feelings, went to the dr's and they said erm that's your baby!

I think my boobs grew a tiny bit at about 10 weeks, that was it. I think its quite common to feel things till the 7/8 week mark and then it go off. I know how you feel, it seems ludicrous such a massive thing can be happeneing to your body and you dont really know about it! But it is so much better than suffering!

I'm sure this has been discussed millions of times but I'm new and sending myself a little bit crazy. My husband and I started trying for a baby on our wedding night (26th June) and did loads of BD on our honeymoon, when I should have been ovulating.  I'm now on day 26 of my cycle and I don't think I'm pregnant because I've got no breast tenderness at all. I'm trying to manage my expactations because I don't want to be absolutely crushed when I get my period.  I know it's early days in our TTC but I have been broody for 10 years and I'm quite impatient! Am I safe to assume that no breast tenderness means that I'm definitely not pregnant?  I have been peeing a lot and I thought I had a bit of nausea but I could have been imagining that. Thanks! xx       Helpful    0    Report      Reply              TulipRose  16/07/2010 at 09:24     PM      Hi Hon, From what I have read it is quite common when pg but it doesn't happen to everyone and especialy not so early.  So it may not mean anything. Unfortunately in ttc everything feels the same and is confusing. AF feels like a period, implantation feels like a period, ovulation feels like cramps and we all work differently. Bit of a waiting game I think. Sorry!  I know this sucks! x       Helpful    0    Report      Reply              MrsKP_  16/07/2010 at 10:30     PM      Hey, I'm GC but just wanted to say that I had no symptoms at all until about 6 weeks, no breast tenderness etc, I was shocked when I got my BFP as I hadn't expected it at all. Even at 6 weeks I didn't really get any symptoms, I got a bit hungry and got slightly tender breasts at about 6/7 weeks but that was it - everyone is really very different! Good luck!

You could have knocked me over with a feather when I got a BFP. I didnt get tender breasts at all with her. I did with my son so every preg is different.

Oh well, you never know then.  I don't feel pregnant so I'm fully expecting to get AF in a few days. Mooker - my cycles vary, they seem to average at about 29 days so that would be Monday/Tuesday coming I think.  I usually get some pre AF spotting by about now though and I haven't got that this month.  Who know's what's going on.  I'll just have to try to be patient. I've actually just ordered some ovulation strips from amazon.  I think it'll make me feel a lot better to at least know exactly when I'm ovulating.

Lack of Symptoms Versus Disappearance of Symptoms    By Robin Elise Weiss, PhD  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated September 17, 2017            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Mango Productions/Getty Images       More in Are You Pregnant?        Signs & Symptoms       Pregnancy Tests        It is not uncommon to think about pregnancy as an endless onslaught of symptoms ranging from morning sickness and heartburn to food cravings and breast tenderness . While many women do experience these and other symptoms, there are those who never feel particularly ill during the entire course of their pregnancy. But does this necessarily mean that everything is okay? Or should the lack of symptoms be more a cause for concern than celebration?         Frequency and Severity of Symptoms Just as the types of pregnancy symptoms can vary from woman to woman, so, too, can their severity. In the end, pregnancy is simply an individual experience with its ​own feature and challenges. As such, neither the type nor severity of symptoms can ever be considered more or less "normal” than the other. The same applies to the frequency of symptoms. From day to day and week to week, what you experience can change frequently. There will be days when you may experience cramping or frequent urination and others when you’ll have constipation or mood swings. There may even be days when you feel perfectly fine with no symptoms at all. If present, most pregnancy symptoms will begin on or around the fourth week of pregnancy. Some of the more overt physical manifestations (such as acne, weight gain, and breast and nipple change) tend to occur between the ninth and eleventh weeks.   By the second trimester , many of the more profound symptoms of pregnancy will begin to subside. while others will continue right up until the moment of delivery. Complete Absence of Pregnancy Symptoms An impromptu search of the internet will reveal a plethora of postings from women who have reported no symptoms during part of all of the first trimester.         Many seem clearly elated by this. Others feel just the opposite, often worrying if this is a sign of a less healthy baby or a pregnancy that may end in miscarriage . Most of these fears are unfounded. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the lack of symptoms places the baby at any risk of either low birth weight, preterm birth , or spontaneous miscarriage. There are, however, two situations that warrant concern. Both relate not so much to the absence of symptoms but rather a change in symptoms that occur suddenly and without explanation: Chief among these are changes in fetal movement . Any decrease in movement, or a complete cessation of movement, may be the sign of an impending pregnancy loss. While some symptoms tend to decrease as the pregnancy progresses, the movement of your baby should not. There may be days when your baby will be quieter, but if movement suddenly stops (or shifts from a lot of activity to a little), you should see your doctor immediately and have it checked out. Just as worrisome is the sudden disappearance of symptoms . We’re not referring to women who have had no symptoms of pregnancy. Rather, we’re concerned about those who have had symptoms and now suddenly have none. The sudden cessation may be the sign of a miscarriage and developmental problem, especially during the first trimester. Even if there are no other symptoms of miscarriage , it is important to have it checked out as soon as possible.         Source: Gabbe, S.; Niebyl, J.; Simpson, J. et al.

Surely you can't be pregnant with no symptoms? How could these people not notice?  Yet doctors say there are many reasons someone might not notice they're pregnant.  "We as human beings have a powerful denial factor," says Dr. Dan Frayne, assistant residency director of the Mountain Area Health Education Center 's Family Medicine Residency Program in Asheville, North Carolina, and cochair of the National Preconception Health and Health Care Initiative . "You can be in denial and neglect to see the changes to your body for a fairly long time. Some women who are overweight might not see a huge change in their body, and if you are skinny, you might not show until 20 weeks."  Denial of pregnancy is more common than expected according to a study in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine . Researchers found that 1 in 475 women may not realize they're pregnant until 20 weeks' gestation, and 1 in 2,500 women make it right up to delivery before finding out (a rate similar to that of eclampsia).

Young teens  It’s not uncommon for a young teenager to be relatively unaware of their body and the changes that occur during pregnancy, Frayne says. Plus, many teens have irregular periods, so missing a period for six months might not be unusual. Frayne explains that sometimes, young teens will seek medical care for abdominal or back pain at 30 or 32 weeks, and when they're told they are pregnant, they'll often admit they suspected as much but were afraid to tell anyone.  Pregnant people who are busy  Plenty of people, particularly women, have competing demands in their lives — children, family, work — that make it difficult for them to pay any attention to themselves and their own bodies, Frayne says. Sometimes, it takes time for them to either recognize the changes or decide they want to see a doctor.  People with addiction  People struggling with an addiction or those who otherwise abuse substances often won't notice they're pregnant simply because it's not a primary concern for them, Frayne explains.  People who believe they don't need prenatal care  Sometimes, someone who has either been pregnant before or who believes they already know what to do about a potential pregnancy skips out on doctor visits and thus misses pregnancy indications, Frayne says.  More:  The Real Cost of Fertility Treatments & Adoption  One of the underlying causes for this denial, says Frayne, is that a little less than half of U.S. pregnancies are unplanned or unwanted. For example, according to a study published in 2011 , in 2006, 49 percent of pregnancies were unintended — a slight increase from 48 percent in 2001. But while many pregnant people are indeed in denial, when they finally do seek medical advice and the pregnancy is confirmed, the majority of them aren't surprised. "In many cases, they are being told something they knew and suspected but didn’t want to admit," Frayne adds.  Unfortunately, this lack of awareness can put both mother and child at risk for complications during birth. The concern, says Frayne, is that prenatal care provides the best opportunity for a healthy pregnancy. It's important for a pregnant person to visit the doctor within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy, he says. Unfortunately, even when people know they are pregnant, they often don't visit their doctor early enough, largely because they lack health insurance and access to care.  And despite the fact that the U.S. spends more money on health care than any other country, we have one of the worst infant mortality rates compared with similar economically developed countries. According to the CDC, in 2015, over 23,000 infants died in the United States, with the infant mortality rate at 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.  The United States also has a rising maternal death rate . "The U.S. is the only developed country where more mothers are dying now than 10 to 20 years ago," Frayne says.

"Women of reproductive age aren’t as healthy as they used to be," Frayne says, noting that, in 2015, 43 percent of U.S. women of reproductive age have a medical condition, more than half are obese and 1 in 5 don’t have health insurance.  One question all health care providers should ask their patients is whether they want to become pregnant in the next year, Frayne says. Simply asking the question will encourage patients and doctors to discuss preconception and prenatal care. That's one step in the right direction — but the far bigger step is access to affordable care.  A version of this article was originally published in December 2015.
