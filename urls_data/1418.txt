Mark Wilson / Getty Images   Jury chairs sit empty inside the courtroom of the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Mark Wilson / Getty Images      Dear Mona,  How many Americans serve as jurors in an actual trial in their lifetimes? I’m asking because I was just picked to serve in a jury trial for the third time. Most people I know have never had to sit through a trial as a juror. They may have been called for jury duty, but they were usually dismissed the same day. Am I some sort of an exception?  Andrew, 45, Connecticut   Dear Andrew,  In a 2012 survey, 27 percent of U.S. adults said they had served on a jury at some point in their lives. That survey was conducted by DRI, a membership organization for defense lawyers, and was based on only 1,020 interviews — but it’s the best source I can find to answer your question about lifetime jury service. To get more detailed national numbers, I’m going to have to zoom in on a shorter timeframe.  The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) estimates that in a given year, 32 million people get summoned for service — though only 8 million of them actually report for jury duty (there are lots of reasons for that difference, including the 4 million summonses returned by the post office marked as undeliverable and the 3 million people who fail to appear). It’s estimated that only 1.5 million people are eventually selected to serve on a jury in a state court each year. Those numbers, the most recent available, come from a 2007 survey conducted by the NCSC.  NCSC analyst Greg Hurley explained to me that while federal courts are under a unified system that makes data collection pretty easy, “state courts are a different bird.” Their sheer number (there are more than 3,000 U.S. counties, and almost every one has a court), as well as their differing practices in jury selection, makes it impossible to collect state-court-level data without time-consuming and expensive surveys. So, to get more recent and more detailed data, I’m going to have to look at the federal courts. Which is a shame because that data represents a small fraction of all U.S. adults’ experiences of jury service.  Last year, almost 64,000 people were selected for federal jury service in the U.S. — that’s only 0.03 percent of the adult population. If you want to understand the probability of getting selected, you have to use the adult population as your baseline because you have to be at least 18 to serve on a U.S. jury. That’s not the only condition for jury service , though — in fact, the pool of people from which juries can be drawn is considerably smaller than the 238 million adults in America.  To be legally qualified for federal jury service, you also have to be a U.S. citizen, which, according to 2013 estimates from the Census Bureau, brings the number of potential federal jurors down to 218 million adults. Another condition for serving is that, with some exceptions, you can’t have been convicted of a felony — which as of 2010 ruled out about 6 million adults, taking us to 212 million.  And, if your English isn’t proficient enough to satisfactorily complete the juror qualification form, you can’t serve, either — that could affect some of the nearly one in 10 working-age U.S. adults who in 2012 were considered “limited English proficient.” 1  There are even more criteria to be legally qualified for federal jury service than we can get into here — and they’re even more complex to quantify. 2 So I don’t know the number of people who are eligible to be jurors in the U.S., and without that number, I can’t really give you an accurate probability about your chances of getting selected. Please try to keep that in mind as you read on.  Let’s go back for a minute to the number of people who were selected for federal jury service last year. In the 12 months through September 2014, 48,877 adults served in trial juries, according to caseload statistics from the U.S. federal court system. Another estimated 14,879 adults served in grand juries over that period. In the case of grand juries , the federal courts track only the number of grand juries (763 last year) and the number of times jurors report to them (164,856 last year — meaning one juror that attends on five days is counted five times). So to figure out the number of jurors that represents, I had to use an estimate (a federal courts spokeswoman told me in an email, “We know it’s in the range of 12,208-17,549,” so I took the midpoint of that range).  That’s your first clue that those two types of jury are a little different . A trial jury, also known as a petit jury, tends to be smaller than a grand jury. Its purpose is slightly different, too — a trial jury reaches a verdict (either in favor of plaintiff/defendant in a civil case or guilty/not guilty in a criminal case), and a grand jury is tasked with determining whether there is “probable cause” to believe a person has committed a crime. Technically, adding the number of adults who have served on a trial jury and a grand jury is a little simplistic; it’s possible that someone may have served as a juror twice in a given year, but it’s highly improbable. The random selection process makes it unlikely that someone will get called to serve twice — and once you’ve served, the Jury Act also excuses you from federal jury service for the next two years (exception: if you served on a petit trial that lasted less than a month).  Selection is just one part of this story — a whole lot of Americans get called for duty but never witness a trial (people on grand juries don’t witness a trial, so we’ll exclude them here).  In the 12 months through September 2014, a total of 218,203 U.S. citizens were present for federal trial jury selection — but only 22.4 percent of those adults were eventually selected, according to the U.S. courts. Overall then, 0.09 percent of U.S. adults were called to serve on trial juries in 2014, and 0.02 percent ended up serving.  The federal courts are trying to change those numbers, because inviting a potential jury member and then not selecting her is costly. In the federal system, the courts are required to pay prospective jurors $40 a day, whether they’re selected to serve or not. That means wasted juror time costs the federal judiciary hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.  Selection rates don’t just reflect everything about how the court system works — human behavior is a factor, and some people try to maximize or minimize their chances of getting selected to serve once they’re called upon. I won’t even attempt to quantify that for you, though, Andrew — to do so would require data that could be affected by people’s willingness to tell the truth about what they do when they get called for jury duty, not to mention their ability to be aware of their own biases and behavior.  And once you get past the top-line facts about the number of people called and selected, the reality of who serves on a jury is infinitely more complicated. That’s because the details of a case are of huge importance to the attorneys selecting the jury. This interactive graphic by The New York Times does a good job of illustrating how prosecutors and defense lawyers pick jurors. It’s based on a hypothetical scenario where the plaintiff is a woman in her 60s who says she lost money because her investments were mismanaged. As well as occupation, age and income level, the factors that affect a prospective juror’s chances of being selected for that trial include whether she has close family or friends in the finance industry and even whether she likes crossword puzzles. All of which is yet further evidence that understanding the probability of being selected for jury duty involves a lot of variables.  The numbers do show that the chances of getting called in the past 12 months are pretty low. And the fact that you’ve served on three juries now does seem pretty remarkable, Andrew. But maybe you’re the perfect juror. I don’t know anything about you other than your age, state and gender — let alone details about the trials you’ve served on. All those variables could either make it more surprising that you’ve served three times — or a lot less surprising.  Hope the numbers help,  Mona  Have a question you would like answered here?

Footnotes   That term describes people who speak English as a second language and who have rated their ability to speak English as “well,” “not well” or “not at all.”  You must “reside primarily in the judicial district for one year,” “have no disqualifying mental or physical condition” and “not currently be subject to felony charges punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,” according to the federal courts. What’s more, the following groups are exempt from serving: Members of the armed forces on active duty, members of professional fire and police departments; and “public officers” of federal, state or local governments, who are actively engaged full-time in the performance of public duties. In some state courts, there are additional conditions and exemptions for jury service. In Minnesota , for example, those who are older than 70 can ask to be excused, while in Texas , citizens who can’t read and write or who aren’t “of sound mind and good moral character” are disqualified.

Mona Chalabi of FiveThirtyEight.com joins NPR's Rachel Martin for a look at who those people are.       UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Fifty-two.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 11:53.  UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Twenty-five.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: 6.11.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Twenty-five thousand eight hundred and forty-two.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Time now for some number crunching from our data expert Mona Chalabi from fivethirtyeight.com. She has given us this number of the week.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: 32 million.  MARTIN: That's the number of people who get summoned each year for jury duty in U.S. state courts. Mona Chalabi has been looking closely at the number of Americans who get called upon to serve on a jury. Hey, Mona.  MONA CHALABI: Hi, Rachel.  MARTIN: So what made you start looking into this particular number?  CHALABI: Well, it actually came as a question from a reader. I write a column as a kind of statistical Dear Abby. This one reader, Andrew, who's 45 and lives in Connecticut, he got in touch to tell me that he had served on multiple juries and wanted to know whether or not that's unusual. So I started to look for some national data. And I came across that number that you mentioned - 32 million. And that's the number of Americans that get summoned each year. The number comes from a 2007 survey by the National Center for State Courts. They surveyed over a thousand local courts and almost 12,000 judges and lawyers to get to that number.  MARTIN: OK.  CHALABI: But the problem is is that I don't have any more recent data since 2007 beyond that one particular survey. It's incredibly hard to collect data from these state courts because there are so many of them and because their practices differ so widely from place to place.  MARTIN: All right, so based on what you do know, is it possible to figure out how many people actually show up for jury duty because it's one thing to get a summons in the mail, but you know, getting to the courthouse is sometimes another.  CHALABI: Yeah, absolutely. The number is far lower than that 32 million we started with. So based on the same survey that comes from these guys, they found that each year, the state court summoned 32 million people, but when it comes to actually showing up, only 8 million people actually report for jury service. And there's lots of reasons why that number reduces from 32 million to 8 million including the 4 million summonses that are returned by the post office marked as undeliverable, the 3 million people that get excused for financial or medical hardship and another 3 million that simply fail to show up.  MARTIN: Three million people just don't come, wow, OK.  CHALABI: Yeah. Exactly.  MARTIN: OK, so 8 million people report for service. Do we know anything about the numbers of those folks who actually get selected for juries?  CHALABI: Yeah, it's even smaller still. So we're down to about 1.5 million Americans each year.  MARTIN: All right, understanding that the details of any particular case will determine the kinds of jurors the attorneys are looking for, is there a kind of person who is more likely to get selected for juries?  CHALABI: Absolutely, but that person will vary depending on the nature of the trial, which is why the math behind this is so difficult. To illustrate that, The New York Times actually created this interactive that shows how many different factors are at play. So it presents you with a hypothetical scenario. In this case, you're a potential juror in a case where the plaintiff is a woman in her 60s. The woman says she's lost money because her investments were mismanaged. Then the interactive asks you dozens of questions, and some of them are things that you might expect anyway, like occupation, age and income level. But then there are also things that are so particular to the case, things like do you have close friends or family in the finance industry and even whether you like crossword puzzles. And if you think about that in terms of variables that I would need to quantify to work out the kinds of people likely to be selected, you start to see that in terms of mathematical probabilities, this is incredibly difficult to understand.  MARTIN: So you're basically saying you're off the hook, right? Like, there's no way that you can tell us the odds of any one of us getting selected for jury duty. All right, fine.  CHALABI: (Laughter) I'm sorry, I really did try.  MARTIN: (Laughter) That's OK. It's our civic duty, we should say. Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight.com. Thanks so much, Mona.  CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel.  (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "54-46 WAS MY NUMBER")  TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS: (Singing) 54-46, that's my number. 54-46 that's my number.  Copyright © 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Jury Service Video Brochure (ohiojudges.org)                 How many jurors must agree on a verdict?  The type of case determines the number of jurors who must agree on a verdict.  A civil case is usually between two or more persons, companies or corporations 
  who have a dispute concerning money or property. The party suing for compensation 
  is called the "plaintiff." The party being sued is called the "defendant." 
  In a civil case, the jurors must decide if and/or how to compensate the plaintiff 
  for any damages. In civil cases, six (6) jurors (three-fourths of the eight 
  jurors) must agree on a verdict.  In a criminal case, the "defendant" is a person charged with a crime. 
  A crime is a violation of a law enacted by the legislature to protect our basic 
  rights. Because crimes are considered acts against the state, and because the 
  state is responsible for legally enforcing the laws of the people, the State 
  of Ohio prosecutes these cases as the "plaintiff." In a criminal case, 
  twelve (12) jurors determine if an accused person is guilty or not guilty of 
  a charge, and the verdict must be unanimous.

Jury selection   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search         The examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (June 2012)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Jury selection is the selection of the people who will serve on a jury during a jury trial . The group of potential jurors (the "jury pool", also known as the venire ) is first selected from among the community using a reasonably random method. Jury lists are compiled from voter registrations and driver license or ID renewals. From those lists, summons are mailed. A panel of jurors is then assigned to a courtroom. The prospective jurors are randomly selected to sit in the jury box. At this stage they will be questioned in court by the judge and/or attorneys in the United States . Depending on the jurisdiction, attorneys may have an opportunity to mount a challenge for cause argument or use one of a limited number of peremptory challenges . In some jurisdictions that have capital punishment , the jury must be death-qualified to remove those who are opposed to the death penalty. Jury selection and techniques for voir dire are taught to law students in trial advocacy courses. However, attorneys sometimes use expert assistance in systematically choosing the jury , although other uses of jury research are becoming more common. The jury selected is said to have been "empaneled".

Selected jurors are generally subjected to a system of examination whereby both the prosecution (or plaintiff, in a civil case) and defense can object to a juror. In common law countries, this is known as voir dire . Voir dire can include both general questions asked of an entire pool of prospective jurors, answered by means such as a show of hands, and questions asked of individual prospective jurors and calling for a verbal answer. In some jurisdictions , the attorneys for the parties may question the potential jurors; in other jurisdictions, the trial judge conducts the voir dire .  The method and scope of the possible rejections varies between countries:   In England , these objections would have to be very well based, such as the defendant knowing a potential juror, to be allowed.  Some jurisdictions, including Australia , Canada , France , New Zealand , Northern Ireland , the Republic of Ireland , and the United States , give both the defense and prosecution a specific number of unconditional peremptory challenges . No justifications have to be brought to exclude a specific juror. Generally, defense attorneys exclude jurors who have professions or backgrounds similar to that of the victim and who could thus feel an emotional link to them, while prosecuting attorneys exclude jurors who might show affinity to the defendant. However, in the United States, if either party excludes a minority group member and the other party challenges, under Batson rules the party exercising the peremptory strike must provide a race-neutral reason for the exclusion (later extended by court rulings to gender-neutral reasons as well). Parties have been known to peremptorily strike jurors based on personal characteristics that wouldn't justify a strike for cause , but which they believe makes the juror less likely to be sympathetic to their side. [1]  In some jurisdictions, attorneys also have the right to make a challenge for cause argument to the judge. This is an argument over whether a juror's particular background or beliefs make them biased and therefore unsuitable for service on the jury.   United States [ edit ]  Main article: Jury selection in the United States  See also: Taylor v. Louisiana  In the United States the process of voir dire is often much more in depth than in other countries and its practical implementation is somewhat controversial because of this. The amount of privacy that the potential jurors are afforded when asked questions raises the issue of the definition of "impartial jury". Some people [ who? ] question if the intensive questioning of potential jurors looks not just for inherent bias but for a potential to be emotionally swayed. On the other hand, proponents argue that this method gives both sides more confidence in the verdict.  Canada [ edit ]  Part XX of the Criminal Code of Canada allows for a jury in a Canadian murder trial to consist of twelve jurors. However, a minimum of ten jurors and a maximum of 14 jurors may hear the evidence a trial. At the end of trial, a maximum of twelve jurors and minimum of ten jurors may deliberate.  Section 631(2.2) as well as section 643 of the Criminal Code specify that a jury may consist of either 12, 13 or 14 members, however, 12 is most common. Section 631(2.2) allows a judge to order that 13 or 14 jurors be sworn in under certain circumstances.  Jurors may also be excused during trial. According to section 644(1) of the Criminal Code , a judge may discharge any juror during the trial due to illness or “other reasonable cause” such as impartiality (see R v Tsouma (1973) and R v Holcomb (1973)). Section 644(2) further specifies that a jury is still properly constituted to complete its duties even if a juror is discharged during the trial as long as the number of jurors is not reduced below ten.  At the conclusion of trial and following the jury charge, a maximum of twelve jurors may deliberate. It requires the judge to pull numbers from a box in order to determine which jurors should be discharged in order to reduce the number of jurors down to twelve.  Jury Identification When empanelling the jury, section 631(3) of the Criminal Code states that the court clerk will draw out the appropriate number of juror cards and read out the name and number of each card in the courtroom. In this sense, the identity of the jurors will be revealed to all parties. However, s. 631(3.1) goes on to say that judge can order that the clerk of the court shall only call out the number on each card, thereby withholding the names of the jury members. This generally takes place upon application by the prosecutor or when the judge deems it necessary in order to protect the safety and privacy of the jury members.  Under s. 631(6) of the Code, the presiding judge may then make an order either directing that the identity of a jury member or any information that could reveal their identity not be published or broadcast in any way; or limiting access to or the use of that information. These amendments to s. 361 were introduced in 2001, with the purpose of “protecting jurors from intimidation, and enabling jurors to participate effectively by making them free to act without being subjected to threats, prejudice, intimidation or physical injury” (R v Jacobson, [2004] O.J. No. 1432 (OSCJ), at para 23).  Peremptory Challenges  In Canada, the number of peremptory challenges (i.e., challenges for which no reason be given) for jury selection is governed by Section 634 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The number of peremptory challenges varies depending on the nature of the offence. The prosecutor and the accused are each allowed: twenty challenges for first-degree murder or high treason; twelve challenges for any offence, except first-degree murder or high treason, where a term of imprisonment exceeding five years is a possible sentence, and; four challenges where the accused is charged with a lesser offence (s. 634 (2), Criminal Code of Canada).  Where multiple offences are tried together, the greatest number applicable is used (i.e., in an offence involving first-degree murder and armed robbery, the accused and the prosecutor are each entitled to twenty peremptory challenges) [s. 634 (3), Criminal Code of Canada].  When multiple accused are tried together, each accused is entitled to the same number that they would receive if tried separately, while the prosecutor has as many challenges as the total number available to all of the accused (i.e., in a case wherein two co-accused are charged with first-degree murder, each receives twenty peremptory challenges, and the prosecutor receives forty) [s. 634 (4), Criminal Code of Canada].  The amount of peremptory challenges can also vary according to the circumstances of the jury. The prosecutor and the accused are each entitled to one additional peremptory challenge if there are 13 jurors, or two additional challenges each in the case of 14 jurors (s. 634 (2.01), Criminal Code of Canada). As well, the number of peremptory challenges increases accordingly if the judge makes an order for alternate jurors at a rate of one additional challenge for each party per alternate juror (s. 634 (2.1), Criminal Code of Canada). In the event that replacement jurors are required, each party is similarly entitled to one peremptory challenge per replacement (s. 634 (2.2) Criminal Code of Canada).   Challenge for Cause Section 638 of the Criminal Code of Canada provides the basis upon which an individual juror may be challenged for cause. A party seeking to challenge a prospective juror’s partiality must first demonstrate to the court that there is an ‘air of reality’ to the application (see R v Sherratt, [1991] 1 SCR 509). A party may do this by establishing that there is a realistic potential for partiality (see R v Williams, [1998] 1 SCR 1128).  Section 640 of the Criminal Code sets out the procedures for dealing with a challenge for cause. A challenge for cause based on the enumerated grounds under section 638, other than the juror’s name not appearing on the panel, will be tried by the last two jurors to be sworn. If no Jurors have been sworn the judge will appoint two persons to try the challenge for cause. Upon application by the accused, the court may exercise its discretion to exclude all sworn and unsworn jurors from the court room until the challenge for cause is decided. The two triers of the challenge for cause must decide the question on a balance of probabilities.  Pre-Hearing Conference Part XX of the Criminal Code of Canada provides for Procedure in Jury Trials. Section 625.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada is the authority for a pre-hearing conference.  A pre-hearing conference is a conference held prior to the beginning of a trial. It is held between the prosecutor and the accused (or counsel for the accused) and is presided over by the court. The purpose of a pre-hearing conference is to promote a fair and expeditious trial. It considers matters that would be better decided before the start of the trial and makes arrangements for the decisions of those matters.  Either the prosecutor, defence or the judge may initiate a motion for a pre-hearing conference.  A pre-hearing conference is mandatory for any case to be tried by jury (per s. 625.1(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada). It must be presided over by a judge of the court that will try the accused, and must be held in accordance with the rules of court made under sections 482 and 482.1.  Case Law: A pre-hearing conference judge does not have the jurisdiction to review the Crown disclosure decisions or to order disclosure [2] .  Death qualification [ edit ]  Main article: Death-qualified jury  In the United States , capital cases (cases where the prosecution pursues the death penalty), the jury must often be "death-qualified". A death-qualified jury is one in which all members of the venire that categorically object to capital punishment are removed. This has the effect of ensuring that the jury will be willing to hand down a sentence of death, if they feel the crime warrants it. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the practice is constitutional. Critics object to death-qualification because empirical evidence [3] has shown that death-qualified jurors are more likely to convict defendants of crimes than are jurors generally.  Assistance of experts [ edit ]  Main articles: Scientific jury selection and Jury research  In the 1970s and 1980s in the United States, scientific jury selection —the use of expert assistance to more effectively use peremptory challenges — became more common. The practice has proven controversial because of fears that it gives lawyers the ability to "fix" the jury and enhances the distorting effect of money. However, research indicates that the effect of the practice is modest at best. [4]  Currently, the more generic jury consulting or jury research is increasingly more common as attorneys trying high-stakes cases demand assistance through all parts of the trial process. The still more generic field of trial consulting also contains a myriad of other tools and techniques not directly related to juries.  Criticism [ edit ]  Jury packing is "illegally or corruptly influencing a jury by making available for jury service persons known to be biased or partial in a particular case to be tried". [5] The term also is applied pejoratively to jury selection procedures which are legal but perceived as unfair. In the nineteenth century, the prosecution had unlimited peremptory challenges in England and Ireland, whereas the defence were limited to six in England or 20 in Ireland. [6]  Peter O'Brien as Crown Prosecutor during the Irish Land War was nicknamed "Peter the Packer" by supporters of the Irish Land League . The pool from which a jury panel is selected may not have the same demographics as the general population; until the nineteenth century or later in many jurisdictions, jury service, as with the electoral franchise , was restricted to male property owners.  In three studies of legal authoritarianism, attitudes toward psychiatrists, and attitude toward the insanity defense were examined as predictors of conviction-proneness in insanity defense cases. [7] Some experts believe that 85% of cases litigated are won or lost in the jury selection phase.

You should be able to opt out of jury duty for life. In exchange, you waive your right to trial by jury if charges are ever brought against you. I think that this would be fair.

However, you aren't going to choose not to participate in the process when it is inconvenient to do so and then swear that it is your right to have the very same process protect you when it becomes beneficial.         trollism     RE: Jury duty tommorow - what are my chances of being selected?  12/15/2010 11:35AM - in reply to Bear of Bad News  trollism      Reply   Return to Index   Report Post  I enjoyed jury duty.

A reader has been told he must serve as a juror for the fifth time. He’s happy to do so, but repeated summons anger others            Patrick Collinson   Sat 20 Aug 2016 01.59 EDT   Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 11.08 EST           Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email                  View more sharing options      Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger           Close                                                   T wo years ago a reader contacted Guardian Money after being summoned for a fourth time to serve on a jury. Now he has been called up again – and wonders if five trips to the jury box is something of a record.  Robert Smith*, 64, says he has enjoyed his previous stints in court and sees it as his civic duty, which he is proud to undertake. But it has left him scratching his head as to why he is called so often.  Plenty of people go through their lives never being summoned; others are called repeatedly. Is selection really, as the government says, entirely random, or is something else at work here?      Why our jury system can be guilty of inflexibility | Letters           Read more       In 2015 there were 361,300 juror summons issued in England and Wales, but the number who actually sat on a jury was just 179,200. With the two nations having a total population of 57.8 million, it means the chances of serving are relatively slim. The Ministry of Justice declined to give figures on the likelihood of being summoned, but a BBC Scotland analysis found that the probability of being asked to serve is just 40% over a lifetime.  That makes Smith’s five summons very rare. The MoJ says that if you are called within two years of the last time you served you have an automatic right to be excused. Smith’s latest summons is almost exactly two years after his last.  Numerous theories abound on the internet as to why some people are called to serve and others not. Some believe they are blacklisted because they have an Irish heritage (dating back to IRA terrorism days), or that they were once a member of CND. Others believe a letter to the courts suggesting you are a “hanger and flogger” will get you off the hook. Some reckon they have been picked because they have been at the same address or same job for years on end and are a conservative, reliable type.  The reality is rather more dull. The Jury Central Summoning Bureau (JCSB) randomly chooses names from the electoral register. It is under no requirement to call people who are a representative cross-section of society – which is why, in theory, it is possible to have juries which are entirely male or female. According to the MoJ, no attempt is made to balance gender, age or ethnicity. It is as random as the prize number generator for premium bonds. Some people hold premium bonds all their life and win nothing, others win again and again.  Smith says those summoned should prize the experience. “I found it really interesting. Some days it can be immensely frustrating, other days rather boring, and sometimes it’s very harrowing. I see it as a citizenship thing – that is, a duty for those called – and should be a source of pride. Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I’ve been with 12 men and women good and true, and they have been an absolute pleasure to work with.”  Smith acknowledges that he has been 23 years at the same address, but he adds that his first summons was at an earlier address in another London borough. It means he has seen the inside of more crown courts than most career criminals.  Ironically, before Smith became semi-retired he worked in HR, and would regularly write letters to the courts asking for an employee to be excused from jury service. “I worked in a big bank, and some staff were under huge pressure. Often it wasn’t them but their managers who would insist that they could not spare the two weeks out of the office.”  Back in the 1980s and 1990s such letters worked, but today the courts are less keen to excuse people. “They gradually got much tougher about it because everyone was doing it. You can understand why – I think the problem was that juries started to be largely made up of retired people and the unemployed.”         Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I’ve been with 12 men and women good and true    Actually, the figures for excusals remain relatively high: of the 361,300 summons in 2015, 27% were excused – up one percentage point on the year earlier.  Some people are automatically excluded from a summons. You’re not wanted if you’re over 70 or under 18. Neither can you serve if you have been in prison in the past 10 years. But other than that, you’ll need a “good reason” why you are unavailable for the next 12 months, otherwise you will simply be deferred and called again at a later date.  Grounds for excusal include:  • You can’t speak or understand English  • You have responsibilities as a carer  • Your excusal would cause “unusual hardship” for your business  • You are a member of the armed forces and your absence would be prejudicial to the efficiency of the service  Most other excuses are treated as reasons to defer, not to avoid, jury service. It used to be the case that “officials” such as police officers, MPs and judges could gain automatic excusal, but those days are gone – police officers who know a particular court well are simply sent to be jurors at other courts outside their working area, while MPs are allowed to avoid jury service in their constituency but will be expected to attend elsewhere. You can even find yourself on a jury sitting next to a judge. They are only excused if they are known to parties involved in the trial. Other than that, they have to turn up, too.  Much more commonly, you can delay jury service but only once, and you have to say when you will be available over the next 12 months.  The main grounds for deferral are:  • You have a holiday booked  • You are having an operation  • You are a teacher and it is exam time  • You are a taking a temporary job (eg a university student during summer) that you’d lose if forced to attend court  The most common complaints about jury service come from young mothers and the self-employed. Mumsnet forums are alive with complaints from mothers with pre-school children. “The accompanying bumf says they pay £32.47 per day for any childcare costs incurred … round here that would just about pay for three hours’ worth of babysitting,” says one, while another says, “I just completed eight days of jury service (in Scotland) and, despite having three pre-schoolers, I was not excused.”                        Don’t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random. Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS via Getty Images   The £32.47 is the fee paid by the courts as expenses to jurors who serve four hours or under, for 10 days or fewer. The figure rises to £64.95 for more than four hours a day, then goes up the longer the case lasts. The courts will also pay £5.71 a day for food and drink.  Many self-employed argue that £64.95 is hardly enough to cover their losses and, what’s more, the person has to provide evidence of loss of earnings before the sum is paid out. Last year, research by Churchill Home Insurance found that one in 20 employers refused to pay their staff if they undertook jury service, while a third stopped after five days. There is no legal obligation for firms to pay employees while on jury service.  Boredom is perhaps a bigger issue for many who are called up. Much of the time a juror spends in crown court is in a room waiting to be called. The MoJ is trying to tackle this, saying its “juror utilisation rate” has rise by 12% since 2006 to around 71%. But that still means a lot of people spending a lot of time twiddling their thumbs.  Typically, jurors are required to be available for 10 days, but sometimes longer. The MoJ says: “The court will always call more people than may be needed to ensure they have enough people when the juries are being picked. Most jurors are called for approximately 10 working days. During this time you could sit on a number of juries covering a wide range of trials; however this cannot be guaranteed.”  If you are called for a trial, 15 of you will be led into the court room, with 12 eventually selected. But don’t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random to sit on the jury. Only then will you find out if you are on a fascinating trial or something rather more dull. And don’t ever think about skipping service – a juror in Leeds who failed to turn up at court, saying “I can’t be bothered, it’s really boring”, was arrested for contempt of court , while another was fined £100 for filing her nails and reading a magazine while hearing a case. The judge called her behaviour “disgraceful”.  * Robert Smith is not his real name    Topics     Consumer affairs        features         Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email           Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger               Reuse this content                            View all comments >            Order by    newest    oldest    recommendations      Show 25    25    50    100    All      Threads    collapsed    expanded    unthreaded       Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Who is eligible for jury service?    Image copyright  PA   Groups of 15 ordinary women and men are selected at random to uphold justice in their local community. It is a civic duty they are obliged to perform. Potential jurors must be at least 18 years old and they should be listed on the electoral roll. They must also have lived in the UK for more than five years since they were 13 years old. However people in some jobs - for example solicitors and police constables - cannot be cited to appear on a jury.     Others who have committed crimes and served time in prison are likely to be disqualified. MPs, MSPs, religious ministers, full-time serving members of the armed forces and people who are over 70 can legitimately apply to be excused. There is a full list of exemptions here . What is the chance of being called for jury service?    Image copyright  Thinkstock   BBC Radio 4's More or Less asked Deirdre Toher, a statistics lecturer at the University of the West of England, to calculate the probability of an eligible person being asked to serve on a jury. She used figures obtained from the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service. She told the programme: "The chance of being called for jury service, as in receiving a citation for jury service, in Scotland is approximately 95% across the 53 years of typical eligibility." Although many people will receive a letter asking them to serve on a jury, far fewer will actually be selected to sit on the jurors' benches. About 30 men and women will be invited to court and 15 will be selected to be part of a jury. In fact, the chance of actually serving on a Scottish jury is about 30%, according to Ms Toher. The probability of being asked to be part of a jury more than once is about 40%, she added. How does that compare to England and Wales?    Image copyright  Thinkstock   South of the border, juries are made up of 12 people, and the odds of being selected for the job are far lower than in Scotland. According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice, there is about a 35% chance of people in England and Wales being summoned for jury service over the course of their lifetime. Only about half of those cited spend any time in court. Listen to the analysis on BBC Radio 4's More or Less on the BBC Radio iPlayer here.

We have reprinted it with permission from the author, Dave Cheng. Below is my step by step guide to avoiding / minimizing jury service. I was summoned and showed up for jury duty on 10/18/11 - 10/19/11 at the 100 Centre Street courthouse in NYC. Was called into 2 trials and ducked both of them*. Part I: Preparation Process: Read every word on your summons. Research online all the exceptions that allow you to postpone or waive your summons. Most importantly, talk to friends, neighbors, coworkers, etc. who have been summoned, or even served, as a juror to learn from their experiences and suggestions. Every jurisdiction will have different rules and procedures. Make sure you know what the loopholes are so you can take advantage of the ones that apply to your situation. Substance: A law school degree or criminal law-related job present the best background/qualifications for getting out of jury duty (more on this in Part III below), but regardless of your background, at the very least, spend 5-10 of online research to understand the concepts of jury selection (i.e., voir dire) [1] and jury nullification [2]. You could even go above and beyond and read trial strategy manuals and talk to jury selection consultants [3] so that you have a better understanding of the type of juror the lawyers on either side are looking to avoid (i.e., how you should be modeling your behavior and appearance). Voir dire is a strategic battle between the lawyers on both sides . Humans are imperfect creatures, and there is no such thing as a completely impartial juror. Hence, picking who decides the case can be as important as the evidence and the legal arguments. Litigators profile jurors based on things like income, race, religion, manner of dressing, profession, etc. Voir Dire is the process by which attorneys select, or perhaps more appropriately reject, certain jurors to hear a case. [4] "Reject" means you get to go home. You want to do everything possible to maximize your chances of rejection by the judge or one of the lawyers. financial hardship, illness, already booked travel plans, currently out of the state, sole caretaker, etc . I do not suggest simply ignoring the summons The chances of an actual penalty are low. be aggressive about it in some jurisdictions, postponing means you're put back in the general eligibility pool be super polite and respectful to everyone around you More breaks means more time away from the waiting room, which means lower chances of being called for a trial. I also found that being nice increased the chances of being let out early (e.g., at 4:30 pm when there's almost chance of another trial calling for jurors instead of a previously mandated 5 pm) or for longer lunch breaks. They'll also give you tips (in addition to what's described below) on how to not get picked. These people are used to dealing with grumpy jurors who do not want to be there so any kindness you throw their way will be appreciated and rewarded. Scheduling : So you didn't have a conflict or illness that was good enough to get you out of the summons, however, you may still have a scheduling inconvenience, particularly if the trial is estimated to drag on. In the second trial I was called for, the judge told us at the beginning that the case would take 3-4 weeks. When she next asked who had a scheduling issue with that, well over 60% of the 50+ potential jurors raised their hands. Each one talked privately with her, and I did not see a single person come back into the room afterwards. Basically you want to make them feel bad . Emphasize how crucial and distressful the missed time will be to you. Good reasons include: if you work solely or mostly on commission or are part of a small business and being out 3-4 weeks will kill your company, if you were planning a trip anytime during the expected length of the trial, needing to care for a loved one or pet and not having anyone who can babysit, etc. Language Barrier / Communication Issues ("act really stupid"): If English is not your first language and you're not able to understand the trial, you're saved. Same applies if you have hearing problems or difficulty communicating with the other jurors for any reason. If you ask a lot of dumbass questions (e.g., "what's 'reasonable doubt' mean? ... wait, I still don't get it, can you explain again? ... wait I thought, the standard was 'preponderance of the evidence' ... oh, so wait, what's the difference between a criminal and a civil trial? ... huh? explain that again?"), the judge will also be more likely to not select you over worries that you'll be too much hassle during the trial. If you decide to go this route, you can prepare in advance by dressing like a slob or mentally incapacitated person Legal Knowledge / Undue Influence ("act really smart"): The reason they don't like picking lawyers to be jurors are because they're afraid a lawyer, due to having a higher perceived knowledge of the law, will unduly influence the opinions of her peers or will tamper with the process in some other way [ See Law: If I'm a juror on a trial and I have a lot of money, can I hire a lawyer to advise me on how to think about the case and my decision? ] If the judge suspects that other jurors will just listen to you and ignore their own views of the case because of your force of personality or specialized knowledge/education, then she'll nix you. This is also part of the reason Mike Rayzman suggesting that you dress nicely and seem busy is not a bad idea (it also makes your time seem more important, in line w/ 1 above). Aside from sounding intelligent, well-spoken, and persuasive, you can also drop hints that you have specific legal knowledge of things like jury nullification (which jurors are not supposed to know about). A judge or lawyer who explains jury nullification to a jury generally results in a mistrial [2 again]. It's a power that the jury has but one that they are not supposed to be aware of. Knowledge / Familiarity with the case : Demonstration of other, non-legal types of knowledge can also save you. When they read the names of the parties and the witnesses at the beginning , pay close attention because if you're acquainted with any of them, you're disqualified (e.g., if your husband used to work for the company that's being sued or if you used to be neighbors with one of the witnesses). Knowledge of the area (e.g., if you used to work or live there) could also help, partly because it raises the chances of a conflict (turns out you know someone involved) as the case progresses but also partly because it decreases the chances of you being impartial (e.g., "I've been to that store, and I think it's an outrage it got robbed. Someone's gonna pay for this") [6]. Awareness of media coverage can also be a disqualifying factor (e.g., "I read about that store getting robbed, and I agree with the NYTimes, the perp should be locked up for life!"). So can personal experiences that are similar to the facts of the case (e.g., "I used to work behind the counter in a store just like that one and was in constant fear of a robbery just like that one.") Partiality : In addition to the judge disqualifying you for possible bias, both sides get peremptory challenges [7] whereby they can eliminate potential jurors. I suggest reviewing the links in [3] and other online sources for the factors involved here, but the gist is that you want to seem extreme in some way. If you come off as very anti-establishment or libertarian, then the prosecution in a criminal trial may worry about your willingness to enforce the law. If you seem like a very strict, rules-oriented person, then the defense might fear an overeagerness to punish. Hope this helped, good luck! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voi... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jur... The 1895 decision in Sparf v. U.S. written by Justice John Marshall Harlan held 5 to 4 that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws. This decision, often cited, has led to a common practice by United States judges to penalize anyone who attempts to present a nullification argument to jurors and to declare a mistrial if such argument has been presented to them. In some states, jurors are likely to be struck from the panel during voir dire if they will not agree to accept as correct the rulings and instructions of the law as provided by the judge. [3] Just a few casual examples: http://www.synchronicsgroup.com/... http://www.litigationps.com/liti... http://www.trialgraphix.com/serv... http://keenetrial.com/blog/2010/... http://2b1inc.com/grand-voir-dir... http://www.askmen.com/money/how_... If the authorities want to penalize you, they'll have to prove that you received the letter in the first place -- which is done by signing a registered letter. As long as you don't sign it, you're likely in the clear. Those who don't return the form might include people who were on vacation, have moved, or simply didn't pick up their mail. So if anyone wants to penalize you, be sure to show 'em your tan. By returning the letter, your name is placed in future random selection processes for potential jurors. The 2 page guide in that link is a helpful supplement to my answer as well. even though I don't think I read the newspaper articles that covered this specific incident, I do follow such coverage closely and I think it's a damn shame that neighborhood has deteriorated so badly. Honestly, I think a conviction, regardless of whether this guy did it, would be a big help in sending a warning to potential muggers in this area. I just get frustrated when I read about this kind of thing in that neighborhood. I sure wish I could do something about it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per...

Sunnyvale, CA           62 friends        0 reviews         It makes me sad, when I read about people who want to duck out of Jury Duty. Please reread what Lauren wrote. I feel that I was lucky to get the Jury I got, when I was falsely accused of a crime. I was accused by a police officer, I had gone to High School with. He claimed not to know me, but he was in my P.E. class in high school. He was a bully than and still is. I was found innocent on one charge, and they dead locked on the second. The DA did not believe the cop in the end. No further charges were ever made. It all started with a minor traffic stop. I felt lucky, that the people listened to my case. - I hope this never happens to you. I could have gone to jail for several years. It is not always bad people that end up in court. - Some are falsely accused. The last time I was called to Jury duty, my dad had just died. They gave me a deferral, and I have not been called since. The time before, I was called, the group of us was in the room waiting to go into the court room, and when the Bailiff told the Judge the Jury was ready, the guy changed his plea to guilty. ( I think he thought the judge would give him a better sentence) We were than excused for that year. The time before that, we the jury I was in, found the guy guilty. It was not even close. We came to the decision in just a few hours. 2 hours ago Lauren C. says: I don't love it either, but it's a privilege as an American citizen to sit on a jury to judge one of your peers.

I feel lucky that I was chosen to be on THAT jury for THAT little girl. I wanted to be picked, since I always wanted to see what jury duty was like. Since it was a molestation trial, the people who got off the jury were a teacher who had a breakdown when questioned, saying she had to report stuff like that all the time. A minister type guy who said he wasn't sure if he could be unbiased and another guy who just wouldn't shut up (seriously!). I think he annoyed the laywers.

There are many countries where you can't participate, or you can, but it's a facade covering corruption on a massive Federal scale. The US is for the most part different from this and is comparatively open.  It does mean that we make sacrifices in our individual lives for the sake of the community, city, state, or country.  But considering the alternatives, such sacrifices like Jury Duty or taking the time to vote, are small in comparison.

Must I respond to my jury duty notice? Who may serve as a juror? Will I be paid for jury service? What if the dates of my jury service conflict with my work or vacation schedule? Why have some people never been called for jury duty? May I volunteer for jury service? I lost my juror summons. How do I find out what court summoned me for jury service? How are jurors contacted for service in federal court? Before potential jurors are summoned for service, their names are randomly drawn from voters lists (and sometimes drivers lists) to receive a questionnaire to determine whether they meet the legal qualifications for jury service. Individuals who receive questionnaires are required to complete and return them to the clerk's office, which then screens the completed questionnaires to determine eligibility for jury service. (In some courts, qualification questionnaires and summonses are mailed together.)  Must I respond to my jury duty notice? Yes, it is legally required, and there are penalties for noncompliance. Jurors perform a vital role in the American system of justice. Jury service is an important civic function that supports one of the fundamental rights of citizens - the right to have their cases decided by a jury of their peers.  Who may serve as a juror? The Jury Act, which is set out at Title 28, U.S. Code, Sections 1861-1878, calls for random selection of citizens' names from voters lists or from voter lists supplemented by additional sources (such as drivers lists). Because random selection is required, individuals may not volunteer for service. More on Jury Service  The Act states that individuals are legally disqualified from service:  if they are not a citizen of the United States 18 years old, who has resided for a period of one year within the judicial district;  if they are unable to read, write, and understand the English language with a degree of proficiency necessary to fill out a qualification form;  if they are unable to speak the English language;  if they are incapable by reason of mental or physical infirmity to render jury service; or  if they have felony charges pending against them punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, or they have been convicted of a felony and their civil rights have not been restored.   In addition, the Jury Act lists three groups that are exempt from federal jury service:  members of the armed forces on active duty;  members of professional fire and police departments; and  "public officers" of federal, state or local governments, who are actively engaged in the performance of public duties.   Persons belonging to these groups may not serve on federal juries, even if they so desire.  Will I be paid for jury service? Yes, federal jurors are paid $40 a day. (Employees of the federal government are paid their regular salary in lieu of this fee.) In most courts, jurors also are reimbursed for reasonable transportation expenses and parking fees.  Your employer may continue your salary during all or part of your jury service, but federal law does not require an employer to do so. Nonetheless, the Jury Act forbids any employer from firing, intimidating, or coercing any permanent employee because of their federal jury service.  What if the dates of my jury service conflict with my work or vacation schedule? The Jury Act allows courts to grant temporary deferrals of service on the grounds of "undue hardship or extreme inconvenience." The qualification questionnaire and juror summons provides specific information on how to request a deferral from your individual court. Whether to grant a deferral is a matter of discretion for the court and cannot be reviewed or appealed to Congress or any other entity.  Why have some people never been called for jury duty? Eligibility for federal jury service is dependent both upon an individual meeting the legal qualifications for service and upon the random chance of having one's name drawn from the source lists.  Each judicial district must have a formal written plan for the selection of jurors, which provides for random selection from a fair cross-section of the community in the district, and which prohibits discrimination in the selection process. Voter records - either voter registration lists or lists of actual voters - are the required source of names for federal court juries. Some courts supplement voter lists with other sources, such as lists of licensed drivers. A copy of a district's jury plan is available for review in the clerk's office.  In addition, many courts offer excuses from service, on individual request, to designated groups of persons or occupational classes. Such groups may include persons over age 70; persons who have, within the past two years, served on a federal jury; and persons who serve as volunteer fire fighters or members of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.  May I volunteer for jury service? While the federal courts appreciate your willingness in participating in jury service, you cannot volunteer to serve. Each judicial district must randomly select potential jurors from a fair cross-section of the community in the district, and discrimination in the selection process is prohibited.  I lost my juror summons. How do I find out what court summoned me for jury service? You may have been called to serve from your local federal court, or a state or other local court in your community. Unfortunately, there is not one place you can go to research the different court systems. To see if you’ve been called to serve on a federal jury, you must contact the local federal district court in your community. Find your local court using the Court Locator .

By Mona Chalabi  Filed under Dear Mona    Facebook Twitter Email                Jury chairs sit empty inside the courtroom of the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Mark Wilson / Getty Images   Jury chairs sit empty inside the courtroom of the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Mark Wilson / Getty Images      Dear Mona,  How many Americans serve as jurors in an actual trial in their lifetimes? I’m asking because I was just picked to serve in a jury trial for the third time. Most people I know have never had to sit through a trial as a juror. They may have been called for jury duty, but they were usually dismissed the same day. Am I some sort of an exception?  Andrew, 45, Connecticut   Dear Andrew,  In a 2012 survey, 27 percent of U.S. adults said they had served on a jury at some point in their lives. That survey was conducted by DRI, a membership organization for defense lawyers, and was based on only 1,020 interviews — but it’s the best source I can find to answer your question about lifetime jury service. To get more detailed national numbers, I’m going to have to zoom in on a shorter timeframe.  The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) estimates that in a given year, 32 million people get summoned for service — though only 8 million of them actually report for jury duty (there are lots of reasons for that difference, including the 4 million summonses returned by the post office marked as undeliverable and the 3 million people who fail to appear). It’s estimated that only 1.5 million people are eventually selected to serve on a jury in a state court each year. Those numbers, the most recent available, come from a 2007 survey conducted by the NCSC.  NCSC analyst Greg Hurley explained to me that while federal courts are under a unified system that makes data collection pretty easy, “state courts are a different bird.” Their sheer number (there are more than 3,000 U.S. counties, and almost every one has a court), as well as their differing practices in jury selection, makes it impossible to collect state-court-level data without time-consuming and expensive surveys. So, to get more recent and more detailed data, I’m going to have to look at the federal courts. Which is a shame because that data represents a small fraction of all U.S. adults’ experiences of jury service.  Last year, almost 64,000 people were selected for federal jury service in the U.S. — that’s only 0.03 percent of the adult population. If you want to understand the probability of getting selected, you have to use the adult population as your baseline because you have to be at least 18 to serve on a U.S. jury. That’s not the only condition for jury service , though — in fact, the pool of people from which juries can be drawn is considerably smaller than the 238 million adults in America.  To be legally qualified for federal jury service, you also have to be a U.S. citizen, which, according to 2013 estimates from the Census Bureau, brings the number of potential federal jurors down to 218 million adults. Another condition for serving is that, with some exceptions, you can’t have been convicted of a felony — which as of 2010 ruled out about 6 million adults, taking us to 212 million.  And, if your English isn’t proficient enough to satisfactorily complete the juror qualification form, you can’t serve, either — that could affect some of the nearly one in 10 working-age U.S. adults who in 2012 were considered “limited English proficient.” 1  There are even more criteria to be legally qualified for federal jury service than we can get into here — and they’re even more complex to quantify. 2 So I don’t know the number of people who are eligible to be jurors in the U.S., and without that number, I can’t really give you an accurate probability about your chances of getting selected. Please try to keep that in mind as you read on.  Let’s go back for a minute to the number of people who were selected for federal jury service last year. In the 12 months through September 2014, 48,877 adults served in trial juries, according to caseload statistics from the U.S. federal court system. Another estimated 14,879 adults served in grand juries over that period. In the case of grand juries , the federal courts track only the number of grand juries (763 last year) and the number of times jurors report to them (164,856 last year — meaning one juror that attends on five days is counted five times). So to figure out the number of jurors that represents, I had to use an estimate (a federal courts spokeswoman told me in an email, “We know it’s in the range of 12,208-17,549,” so I took the midpoint of that range).  That’s your first clue that those two types of jury are a little different . A trial jury, also known as a petit jury, tends to be smaller than a grand jury. Its purpose is slightly different, too — a trial jury reaches a verdict (either in favor of plaintiff/defendant in a civil case or guilty/not guilty in a criminal case), and a grand jury is tasked with determining whether there is “probable cause” to believe a person has committed a crime. Technically, adding the number of adults who have served on a trial jury and a grand jury is a little simplistic; it’s possible that someone may have served as a juror twice in a given year, but it’s highly improbable. The random selection process makes it unlikely that someone will get called to serve twice — and once you’ve served, the Jury Act also excuses you from federal jury service for the next two years (exception: if you served on a petit trial that lasted less than a month).  Selection is just one part of this story — a whole lot of Americans get called for duty but never witness a trial (people on grand juries don’t witness a trial, so we’ll exclude them here).  In the 12 months through September 2014, a total of 218,203 U.S. citizens were present for federal trial jury selection — but only 22.4 percent of those adults were eventually selected, according to the U.S. courts. Overall then, 0.09 percent of U.S. adults were called to serve on trial juries in 2014, and 0.02 percent ended up serving.  The federal courts are trying to change those numbers, because inviting a potential jury member and then not selecting her is costly. In the federal system, the courts are required to pay prospective jurors $40 a day, whether they’re selected to serve or not. That means wasted juror time costs the federal judiciary hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.  Selection rates don’t just reflect everything about how the court system works — human behavior is a factor, and some people try to maximize or minimize their chances of getting selected to serve once they’re called upon. I won’t even attempt to quantify that for you, though, Andrew — to do so would require data that could be affected by people’s willingness to tell the truth about what they do when they get called for jury duty, not to mention their ability to be aware of their own biases and behavior.  And once you get past the top-line facts about the number of people called and selected, the reality of who serves on a jury is infinitely more complicated. That’s because the details of a case are of huge importance to the attorneys selecting the jury. This interactive graphic by The New York Times does a good job of illustrating how prosecutors and defense lawyers pick jurors. It’s based on a hypothetical scenario where the plaintiff is a woman in her 60s who says she lost money because her investments were mismanaged. As well as occupation, age and income level, the factors that affect a prospective juror’s chances of being selected for that trial include whether she has close family or friends in the finance industry and even whether she likes crossword puzzles. All of which is yet further evidence that understanding the probability of being selected for jury duty involves a lot of variables.  The numbers do show that the chances of getting called in the past 12 months are pretty low. And the fact that you’ve served on three juries now does seem pretty remarkable, Andrew. But maybe you’re the perfect juror. I don’t know anything about you other than your age, state and gender — let alone details about the trials you’ve served on. All those variables could either make it more surprising that you’ve served three times — or a lot less surprising.  Hope the numbers help,  Mona  Have a question you would like answered here?

Footnotes   That term describes people who speak English as a second language and who have rated their ability to speak English as “well,” “not well” or “not at all.”  You must “reside primarily in the judicial district for one year,” “have no disqualifying mental or physical condition” and “not currently be subject to felony charges punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,” according to the federal courts. What’s more, the following groups are exempt from serving: Members of the armed forces on active duty, members of professional fire and police departments; and “public officers” of federal, state or local governments, who are actively engaged full-time in the performance of public duties. In some state courts, there are additional conditions and exemptions for jury service. In Minnesota , for example, those who are older than 70 can ask to be excused, while in Texas , citizens who can’t read and write or who aren’t “of sound mind and good moral character” are disqualified.

Mona Chalabi of FiveThirtyEight.com joins NPR's Rachel Martin for a look at who those people are.       UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Fifty-two.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 11:53.  UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Twenty-five.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: 6.11.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Twenty-five thousand eight hundred and forty-two.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Time now for some number crunching from our data expert Mona Chalabi from fivethirtyeight.com. She has given us this number of the week.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: 32 million.  MARTIN: That's the number of people who get summoned each year for jury duty in U.S. state courts. Mona Chalabi has been looking closely at the number of Americans who get called upon to serve on a jury. Hey, Mona.  MONA CHALABI: Hi, Rachel.  MARTIN: So what made you start looking into this particular number?  CHALABI: Well, it actually came as a question from a reader. I write a column as a kind of statistical Dear Abby. This one reader, Andrew, who's 45 and lives in Connecticut, he got in touch to tell me that he had served on multiple juries and wanted to know whether or not that's unusual. So I started to look for some national data. And I came across that number that you mentioned - 32 million. And that's the number of Americans that get summoned each year. The number comes from a 2007 survey by the National Center for State Courts. They surveyed over a thousand local courts and almost 12,000 judges and lawyers to get to that number.  MARTIN: OK.  CHALABI: But the problem is is that I don't have any more recent data since 2007 beyond that one particular survey. It's incredibly hard to collect data from these state courts because there are so many of them and because their practices differ so widely from place to place.  MARTIN: All right, so based on what you do know, is it possible to figure out how many people actually show up for jury duty because it's one thing to get a summons in the mail, but you know, getting to the courthouse is sometimes another.  CHALABI: Yeah, absolutely. The number is far lower than that 32 million we started with. So based on the same survey that comes from these guys, they found that each year, the state court summoned 32 million people, but when it comes to actually showing up, only 8 million people actually report for jury service. And there's lots of reasons why that number reduces from 32 million to 8 million including the 4 million summonses that are returned by the post office marked as undeliverable, the 3 million people that get excused for financial or medical hardship and another 3 million that simply fail to show up.  MARTIN: Three million people just don't come, wow, OK.  CHALABI: Yeah. Exactly.  MARTIN: OK, so 8 million people report for service. Do we know anything about the numbers of those folks who actually get selected for juries?  CHALABI: Yeah, it's even smaller still. So we're down to about 1.5 million Americans each year.  MARTIN: All right, understanding that the details of any particular case will determine the kinds of jurors the attorneys are looking for, is there a kind of person who is more likely to get selected for juries?  CHALABI: Absolutely, but that person will vary depending on the nature of the trial, which is why the math behind this is so difficult. To illustrate that, The New York Times actually created this interactive that shows how many different factors are at play. So it presents you with a hypothetical scenario. In this case, you're a potential juror in a case where the plaintiff is a woman in her 60s. The woman says she's lost money because her investments were mismanaged. Then the interactive asks you dozens of questions, and some of them are things that you might expect anyway, like occupation, age and income level. But then there are also things that are so particular to the case, things like do you have close friends or family in the finance industry and even whether you like crossword puzzles. And if you think about that in terms of variables that I would need to quantify to work out the kinds of people likely to be selected, you start to see that in terms of mathematical probabilities, this is incredibly difficult to understand.  MARTIN: So you're basically saying you're off the hook, right? Like, there's no way that you can tell us the odds of any one of us getting selected for jury duty. All right, fine.  CHALABI: (Laughter) I'm sorry, I really did try.  MARTIN: (Laughter) That's OK. It's our civic duty, we should say. Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight.com. Thanks so much, Mona.  CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel.  (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "54-46 WAS MY NUMBER")  TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS: (Singing) 54-46, that's my number. 54-46 that's my number.  Copyright © 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Jury Service Video Brochure (ohiojudges.org)                 How many jurors must agree on a verdict?  The type of case determines the number of jurors who must agree on a verdict.  A civil case is usually between two or more persons, companies or corporations 
  who have a dispute concerning money or property. The party suing for compensation 
  is called the "plaintiff." The party being sued is called the "defendant." 
  In a civil case, the jurors must decide if and/or how to compensate the plaintiff 
  for any damages. In civil cases, six (6) jurors (three-fourths of the eight 
  jurors) must agree on a verdict.  In a criminal case, the "defendant" is a person charged with a crime. 
  A crime is a violation of a law enacted by the legislature to protect our basic 
  rights. Because crimes are considered acts against the state, and because the 
  state is responsible for legally enforcing the laws of the people, the State 
  of Ohio prosecutes these cases as the "plaintiff." In a criminal case, 
  twelve (12) jurors determine if an accused person is guilty or not guilty of 
  a charge, and the verdict must be unanimous.

Jury selection   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search         The examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (June 2012)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Jury selection is the selection of the people who will serve on a jury during a jury trial . The group of potential jurors (the "jury pool", also known as the venire ) is first selected from among the community using a reasonably random method. Jury lists are compiled from voter registrations and driver license or ID renewals. From those lists, summons are mailed. A panel of jurors is then assigned to a courtroom. The prospective jurors are randomly selected to sit in the jury box. At this stage they will be questioned in court by the judge and/or attorneys in the United States . Depending on the jurisdiction, attorneys may have an opportunity to mount a challenge for cause argument or use one of a limited number of peremptory challenges . In some jurisdictions that have capital punishment , the jury must be death-qualified to remove those who are opposed to the death penalty. Jury selection and techniques for voir dire are taught to law students in trial advocacy courses. However, attorneys sometimes use expert assistance in systematically choosing the jury , although other uses of jury research are becoming more common. The jury selected is said to have been "empaneled".     Contents    1  Voir dire   1.1  United States  1.2  Canada    2  Death qualification  3  Assistance of experts  4  Criticism  5  See also  6  References  7  Further reading     Voir dire [ edit ]  Main article: Voir dire     Depiction of an attorney asking questions during jury selection.    Selected jurors are generally subjected to a system of examination whereby both the prosecution (or plaintiff, in a civil case) and defense can object to a juror. In common law countries, this is known as voir dire . Voir dire can include both general questions asked of an entire pool of prospective jurors, answered by means such as a show of hands, and questions asked of individual prospective jurors and calling for a verbal answer. In some jurisdictions , the attorneys for the parties may question the potential jurors; in other jurisdictions, the trial judge conducts the voir dire .  The method and scope of the possible rejections varies between countries:   In England , these objections would have to be very well based, such as the defendant knowing a potential juror, to be allowed.  Some jurisdictions, including Australia , Canada , France , New Zealand , Northern Ireland , the Republic of Ireland , and the United States , give both the defense and prosecution a specific number of unconditional peremptory challenges . No justifications have to be brought to exclude a specific juror. Generally, defense attorneys exclude jurors who have professions or backgrounds similar to that of the victim and who could thus feel an emotional link to them, while prosecuting attorneys exclude jurors who might show affinity to the defendant. However, in the United States, if either party excludes a minority group member and the other party challenges, under Batson rules the party exercising the peremptory strike must provide a race-neutral reason for the exclusion (later extended by court rulings to gender-neutral reasons as well). Parties have been known to peremptorily strike jurors based on personal characteristics that wouldn't justify a strike for cause , but which they believe makes the juror less likely to be sympathetic to their side. [1]  In some jurisdictions, attorneys also have the right to make a challenge for cause argument to the judge. This is an argument over whether a juror's particular background or beliefs make them biased and therefore unsuitable for service on the jury.   United States [ edit ]  Main article: Jury selection in the United States  See also: Taylor v. Louisiana  In the United States the process of voir dire is often much more in depth than in other countries and its practical implementation is somewhat controversial because of this. The amount of privacy that the potential jurors are afforded when asked questions raises the issue of the definition of "impartial jury". Some people [ who? ] question if the intensive questioning of potential jurors looks not just for inherent bias but for a potential to be emotionally swayed. On the other hand, proponents argue that this method gives both sides more confidence in the verdict.  Canada [ edit ]  Part XX of the Criminal Code of Canada allows for a jury in a Canadian murder trial to consist of twelve jurors. However, a minimum of ten jurors and a maximum of 14 jurors may hear the evidence a trial. At the end of trial, a maximum of twelve jurors and minimum of ten jurors may deliberate.  Section 631(2.2) as well as section 643 of the Criminal Code specify that a jury may consist of either 12, 13 or 14 members, however, 12 is most common. Section 631(2.2) allows a judge to order that 13 or 14 jurors be sworn in under certain circumstances.  Jurors may also be excused during trial. According to section 644(1) of the Criminal Code , a judge may discharge any juror during the trial due to illness or “other reasonable cause” such as impartiality (see R v Tsouma (1973) and R v Holcomb (1973)). Section 644(2) further specifies that a jury is still properly constituted to complete its duties even if a juror is discharged during the trial as long as the number of jurors is not reduced below ten.  At the conclusion of trial and following the jury charge, a maximum of twelve jurors may deliberate. It requires the judge to pull numbers from a box in order to determine which jurors should be discharged in order to reduce the number of jurors down to twelve.  Jury Identification When empanelling the jury, section 631(3) of the Criminal Code states that the court clerk will draw out the appropriate number of juror cards and read out the name and number of each card in the courtroom. In this sense, the identity of the jurors will be revealed to all parties. However, s. 631(3.1) goes on to say that judge can order that the clerk of the court shall only call out the number on each card, thereby withholding the names of the jury members. This generally takes place upon application by the prosecutor or when the judge deems it necessary in order to protect the safety and privacy of the jury members.  Under s. 631(6) of the Code, the presiding judge may then make an order either directing that the identity of a jury member or any information that could reveal their identity not be published or broadcast in any way; or limiting access to or the use of that information. These amendments to s. 361 were introduced in 2001, with the purpose of “protecting jurors from intimidation, and enabling jurors to participate effectively by making them free to act without being subjected to threats, prejudice, intimidation or physical injury” (R v Jacobson, [2004] O.J. No. 1432 (OSCJ), at para 23).  Peremptory Challenges  In Canada, the number of peremptory challenges (i.e., challenges for which no reason be given) for jury selection is governed by Section 634 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The number of peremptory challenges varies depending on the nature of the offence. The prosecutor and the accused are each allowed: twenty challenges for first-degree murder or high treason; twelve challenges for any offence, except first-degree murder or high treason, where a term of imprisonment exceeding five years is a possible sentence, and; four challenges where the accused is charged with a lesser offence (s. 634 (2), Criminal Code of Canada).  Where multiple offences are tried together, the greatest number applicable is used (i.e., in an offence involving first-degree murder and armed robbery, the accused and the prosecutor are each entitled to twenty peremptory challenges) [s. 634 (3), Criminal Code of Canada].  When multiple accused are tried together, each accused is entitled to the same number that they would receive if tried separately, while the prosecutor has as many challenges as the total number available to all of the accused (i.e., in a case wherein two co-accused are charged with first-degree murder, each receives twenty peremptory challenges, and the prosecutor receives forty) [s. 634 (4), Criminal Code of Canada].  The amount of peremptory challenges can also vary according to the circumstances of the jury. The prosecutor and the accused are each entitled to one additional peremptory challenge if there are 13 jurors, or two additional challenges each in the case of 14 jurors (s. 634 (2.01), Criminal Code of Canada). As well, the number of peremptory challenges increases accordingly if the judge makes an order for alternate jurors at a rate of one additional challenge for each party per alternate juror (s. 634 (2.1), Criminal Code of Canada). In the event that replacement jurors are required, each party is similarly entitled to one peremptory challenge per replacement (s. 634 (2.2) Criminal Code of Canada).   Challenge for Cause Section 638 of the Criminal Code of Canada provides the basis upon which an individual juror may be challenged for cause. A party seeking to challenge a prospective juror’s partiality must first demonstrate to the court that there is an ‘air of reality’ to the application (see R v Sherratt, [1991] 1 SCR 509). A party may do this by establishing that there is a realistic potential for partiality (see R v Williams, [1998] 1 SCR 1128).  Section 640 of the Criminal Code sets out the procedures for dealing with a challenge for cause. A challenge for cause based on the enumerated grounds under section 638, other than the juror’s name not appearing on the panel, will be tried by the last two jurors to be sworn. If no Jurors have been sworn the judge will appoint two persons to try the challenge for cause. Upon application by the accused, the court may exercise its discretion to exclude all sworn and unsworn jurors from the court room until the challenge for cause is decided. The two triers of the challenge for cause must decide the question on a balance of probabilities.  Pre-Hearing Conference Part XX of the Criminal Code of Canada provides for Procedure in Jury Trials. Section 625.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada is the authority for a pre-hearing conference.  A pre-hearing conference is a conference held prior to the beginning of a trial. It is held between the prosecutor and the accused (or counsel for the accused) and is presided over by the court. The purpose of a pre-hearing conference is to promote a fair and expeditious trial. It considers matters that would be better decided before the start of the trial and makes arrangements for the decisions of those matters.  Either the prosecutor, defence or the judge may initiate a motion for a pre-hearing conference.  A pre-hearing conference is mandatory for any case to be tried by jury (per s. 625.1(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada). It must be presided over by a judge of the court that will try the accused, and must be held in accordance with the rules of court made under sections 482 and 482.1.  Case Law: A pre-hearing conference judge does not have the jurisdiction to review the Crown disclosure decisions or to order disclosure [2] .  Death qualification [ edit ]  Main article: Death-qualified jury  In the United States , capital cases (cases where the prosecution pursues the death penalty), the jury must often be "death-qualified". A death-qualified jury is one in which all members of the venire that categorically object to capital punishment are removed. This has the effect of ensuring that the jury will be willing to hand down a sentence of death, if they feel the crime warrants it. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the practice is constitutional. Critics object to death-qualification because empirical evidence [3] has shown that death-qualified jurors are more likely to convict defendants of crimes than are jurors generally.  Assistance of experts [ edit ]  Main articles: Scientific jury selection and Jury research  In the 1970s and 1980s in the United States, scientific jury selection —the use of expert assistance to more effectively use peremptory challenges — became more common. The practice has proven controversial because of fears that it gives lawyers the ability to "fix" the jury and enhances the distorting effect of money. However, research indicates that the effect of the practice is modest at best. [4]  Currently, the more generic jury consulting or jury research is increasingly more common as attorneys trying high-stakes cases demand assistance through all parts of the trial process. The still more generic field of trial consulting also contains a myriad of other tools and techniques not directly related to juries.  Criticism [ edit ]  Jury packing is "illegally or corruptly influencing a jury by making available for jury service persons known to be biased or partial in a particular case to be tried". [5] The term also is applied pejoratively to jury selection procedures which are legal but perceived as unfair. In the nineteenth century, the prosecution had unlimited peremptory challenges in England and Ireland, whereas the defence were limited to six in England or 20 in Ireland. [6]  Peter O'Brien as Crown Prosecutor during the Irish Land War was nicknamed "Peter the Packer" by supporters of the Irish Land League . The pool from which a jury panel is selected may not have the same demographics as the general population; until the nineteenth century or later in many jurisdictions, jury service, as with the electoral franchise , was restricted to male property owners.  In three studies of legal authoritarianism, attitudes toward psychiatrists, and attitude toward the insanity defense were examined as predictors of conviction-proneness in insanity defense cases. [7] Some experts believe that 85% of cases litigated are won or lost in the jury selection phase.

A reader has been told he must serve as a juror for the fifth time. He’s happy to do so, but repeated summons anger others            Patrick Collinson   Sat 20 Aug 2016 01.59 EDT   Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 11.08 EST           Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email                  View more sharing options      Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger           Close                                                   T wo years ago a reader contacted Guardian Money after being summoned for a fourth time to serve on a jury. Now he has been called up again – and wonders if five trips to the jury box is something of a record.  Robert Smith*, 64, says he has enjoyed his previous stints in court and sees it as his civic duty, which he is proud to undertake. But it has left him scratching his head as to why he is called so often.  Plenty of people go through their lives never being summoned; others are called repeatedly. Is selection really, as the government says, entirely random, or is something else at work here?      Why our jury system can be guilty of inflexibility | Letters           Read more       In 2015 there were 361,300 juror summons issued in England and Wales, but the number who actually sat on a jury was just 179,200. With the two nations having a total population of 57.8 million, it means the chances of serving are relatively slim. The Ministry of Justice declined to give figures on the likelihood of being summoned, but a BBC Scotland analysis found that the probability of being asked to serve is just 40% over a lifetime.  That makes Smith’s five summons very rare. The MoJ says that if you are called within two years of the last time you served you have an automatic right to be excused. Smith’s latest summons is almost exactly two years after his last.  Numerous theories abound on the internet as to why some people are called to serve and others not. Some believe they are blacklisted because they have an Irish heritage (dating back to IRA terrorism days), or that they were once a member of CND. Others believe a letter to the courts suggesting you are a “hanger and flogger” will get you off the hook. Some reckon they have been picked because they have been at the same address or same job for years on end and are a conservative, reliable type.  The reality is rather more dull. The Jury Central Summoning Bureau (JCSB) randomly chooses names from the electoral register. It is under no requirement to call people who are a representative cross-section of society – which is why, in theory, it is possible to have juries which are entirely male or female. According to the MoJ, no attempt is made to balance gender, age or ethnicity. It is as random as the prize number generator for premium bonds. Some people hold premium bonds all their life and win nothing, others win again and again.  Smith says those summoned should prize the experience. “I found it really interesting. Some days it can be immensely frustrating, other days rather boring, and sometimes it’s very harrowing. I see it as a citizenship thing – that is, a duty for those called – and should be a source of pride. Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I’ve been with 12 men and women good and true, and they have been an absolute pleasure to work with.”  Smith acknowledges that he has been 23 years at the same address, but he adds that his first summons was at an earlier address in another London borough. It means he has seen the inside of more crown courts than most career criminals.  Ironically, before Smith became semi-retired he worked in HR, and would regularly write letters to the courts asking for an employee to be excused from jury service. “I worked in a big bank, and some staff were under huge pressure. Often it wasn’t them but their managers who would insist that they could not spare the two weeks out of the office.”  Back in the 1980s and 1990s such letters worked, but today the courts are less keen to excuse people. “They gradually got much tougher about it because everyone was doing it. You can understand why – I think the problem was that juries started to be largely made up of retired people and the unemployed.”         Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I’ve been with 12 men and women good and true    Actually, the figures for excusals remain relatively high: of the 361,300 summons in 2015, 27% were excused – up one percentage point on the year earlier.  Some people are automatically excluded from a summons. You’re not wanted if you’re over 70 or under 18. Neither can you serve if you have been in prison in the past 10 years. But other than that, you’ll need a “good reason” why you are unavailable for the next 12 months, otherwise you will simply be deferred and called again at a later date.  Grounds for excusal include:  • You can’t speak or understand English  • You have responsibilities as a carer  • Your excusal would cause “unusual hardship” for your business  • You are a member of the armed forces and your absence would be prejudicial to the efficiency of the service  Most other excuses are treated as reasons to defer, not to avoid, jury service. It used to be the case that “officials” such as police officers, MPs and judges could gain automatic excusal, but those days are gone – police officers who know a particular court well are simply sent to be jurors at other courts outside their working area, while MPs are allowed to avoid jury service in their constituency but will be expected to attend elsewhere. You can even find yourself on a jury sitting next to a judge. They are only excused if they are known to parties involved in the trial. Other than that, they have to turn up, too.  Much more commonly, you can delay jury service but only once, and you have to say when you will be available over the next 12 months.  The main grounds for deferral are:  • You have a holiday booked  • You are having an operation  • You are a teacher and it is exam time  • You are a taking a temporary job (eg a university student during summer) that you’d lose if forced to attend court  The most common complaints about jury service come from young mothers and the self-employed. Mumsnet forums are alive with complaints from mothers with pre-school children. “The accompanying bumf says they pay £32.47 per day for any childcare costs incurred … round here that would just about pay for three hours’ worth of babysitting,” says one, while another says, “I just completed eight days of jury service (in Scotland) and, despite having three pre-schoolers, I was not excused.”                        Don’t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random. Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS via Getty Images   The £32.47 is the fee paid by the courts as expenses to jurors who serve four hours or under, for 10 days or fewer. The figure rises to £64.95 for more than four hours a day, then goes up the longer the case lasts. The courts will also pay £5.71 a day for food and drink.  Many self-employed argue that £64.95 is hardly enough to cover their losses and, what’s more, the person has to provide evidence of loss of earnings before the sum is paid out. Last year, research by Churchill Home Insurance found that one in 20 employers refused to pay their staff if they undertook jury service, while a third stopped after five days. There is no legal obligation for firms to pay employees while on jury service.  Boredom is perhaps a bigger issue for many who are called up. Much of the time a juror spends in crown court is in a room waiting to be called. The MoJ is trying to tackle this, saying its “juror utilisation rate” has rise by 12% since 2006 to around 71%. But that still means a lot of people spending a lot of time twiddling their thumbs.  Typically, jurors are required to be available for 10 days, but sometimes longer. The MoJ says: “The court will always call more people than may be needed to ensure they have enough people when the juries are being picked. Most jurors are called for approximately 10 working days. During this time you could sit on a number of juries covering a wide range of trials; however this cannot be guaranteed.”  If you are called for a trial, 15 of you will be led into the court room, with 12 eventually selected. But don’t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random to sit on the jury. Only then will you find out if you are on a fascinating trial or something rather more dull. And don’t ever think about skipping service – a juror in Leeds who failed to turn up at court, saying “I can’t be bothered, it’s really boring”, was arrested for contempt of court , while another was fined £100 for filing her nails and reading a magazine while hearing a case. The judge called her behaviour “disgraceful”.  * Robert Smith is not his real name    Topics     Consumer affairs        features         Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email           Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger               Reuse this content                            View all comments >            Order by    newest    oldest    recommendations      Show 25    25    50    100    All      Threads    collapsed    expanded    unthreaded       Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Who is eligible for jury service?    Image copyright  PA   Groups of 15 ordinary women and men are selected at random to uphold justice in their local community. It is a civic duty they are obliged to perform. Potential jurors must be at least 18 years old and they should be listed on the electoral roll. They must also have lived in the UK for more than five years since they were 13 years old. However people in some jobs - for example solicitors and police constables - cannot be cited to appear on a jury.     Others who have committed crimes and served time in prison are likely to be disqualified. MPs, MSPs, religious ministers, full-time serving members of the armed forces and people who are over 70 can legitimately apply to be excused. There is a full list of exemptions here . What is the chance of being called for jury service?    Image copyright  Thinkstock   BBC Radio 4's More or Less asked Deirdre Toher, a statistics lecturer at the University of the West of England, to calculate the probability of an eligible person being asked to serve on a jury. She used figures obtained from the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service. She told the programme: "The chance of being called for jury service, as in receiving a citation for jury service, in Scotland is approximately 95% across the 53 years of typical eligibility." Although many people will receive a letter asking them to serve on a jury, far fewer will actually be selected to sit on the jurors' benches. About 30 men and women will be invited to court and 15 will be selected to be part of a jury. In fact, the chance of actually serving on a Scottish jury is about 30%, according to Ms Toher. The probability of being asked to be part of a jury more than once is about 40%, she added. How does that compare to England and Wales?    Image copyright  Thinkstock   South of the border, juries are made up of 12 people, and the odds of being selected for the job are far lower than in Scotland. According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice, there is about a 35% chance of people in England and Wales being summoned for jury service over the course of their lifetime. Only about half of those cited spend any time in court. Listen to the analysis on BBC Radio 4's More or Less on the BBC Radio iPlayer here.

We have reprinted it with permission from the author, Dave Cheng. Below is my step by step guide to avoiding / minimizing jury service. I was summoned and showed up for jury duty on 10/18/11 - 10/19/11 at the 100 Centre Street courthouse in NYC. Was called into 2 trials and ducked both of them*. Part I: Preparation Process: Read every word on your summons. Research online all the exceptions that allow you to postpone or waive your summons. Most importantly, talk to friends, neighbors, coworkers, etc. who have been summoned, or even served, as a juror to learn from their experiences and suggestions. Every jurisdiction will have different rules and procedures. Make sure you know what the loopholes are so you can take advantage of the ones that apply to your situation. Substance: A law school degree or criminal law-related job present the best background/qualifications for getting out of jury duty (more on this in Part III below), but regardless of your background, at the very least, spend 5-10 of online research to understand the concepts of jury selection (i.e., voir dire) [1] and jury nullification [2]. You could even go above and beyond and read trial strategy manuals and talk to jury selection consultants [3] so that you have a better understanding of the type of juror the lawyers on either side are looking to avoid (i.e., how you should be modeling your behavior and appearance). Voir dire is a strategic battle between the lawyers on both sides . Humans are imperfect creatures, and there is no such thing as a completely impartial juror. Hence, picking who decides the case can be as important as the evidence and the legal arguments. Litigators profile jurors based on things like income, race, religion, manner of dressing, profession, etc. Voir Dire is the process by which attorneys select, or perhaps more appropriately reject, certain jurors to hear a case. [4] "Reject" means you get to go home. You want to do everything possible to maximize your chances of rejection by the judge or one of the lawyers. financial hardship, illness, already booked travel plans, currently out of the state, sole caretaker, etc . I do not suggest simply ignoring the summons The chances of an actual penalty are low. be aggressive about it in some jurisdictions, postponing means you're put back in the general eligibility pool be super polite and respectful to everyone around you More breaks means more time away from the waiting room, which means lower chances of being called for a trial. I also found that being nice increased the chances of being let out early (e.g., at 4:30 pm when there's almost chance of another trial calling for jurors instead of a previously mandated 5 pm) or for longer lunch breaks. They'll also give you tips (in addition to what's described below) on how to not get picked. These people are used to dealing with grumpy jurors who do not want to be there so any kindness you throw their way will be appreciated and rewarded. Scheduling : So you didn't have a conflict or illness that was good enough to get you out of the summons, however, you may still have a scheduling inconvenience, particularly if the trial is estimated to drag on. In the second trial I was called for, the judge told us at the beginning that the case would take 3-4 weeks. When she next asked who had a scheduling issue with that, well over 60% of the 50+ potential jurors raised their hands. Each one talked privately with her, and I did not see a single person come back into the room afterwards. Basically you want to make them feel bad . Emphasize how crucial and distressful the missed time will be to you. Good reasons include: if you work solely or mostly on commission or are part of a small business and being out 3-4 weeks will kill your company, if you were planning a trip anytime during the expected length of the trial, needing to care for a loved one or pet and not having anyone who can babysit, etc. Language Barrier / Communication Issues ("act really stupid"): If English is not your first language and you're not able to understand the trial, you're saved. Same applies if you have hearing problems or difficulty communicating with the other jurors for any reason. If you ask a lot of dumbass questions (e.g., "what's 'reasonable doubt' mean? ... wait, I still don't get it, can you explain again? ... wait I thought, the standard was 'preponderance of the evidence' ... oh, so wait, what's the difference between a criminal and a civil trial? ... huh? explain that again?"), the judge will also be more likely to not select you over worries that you'll be too much hassle during the trial. If you decide to go this route, you can prepare in advance by dressing like a slob or mentally incapacitated person Legal Knowledge / Undue Influence ("act really smart"): The reason they don't like picking lawyers to be jurors are because they're afraid a lawyer, due to having a higher perceived knowledge of the law, will unduly influence the opinions of her peers or will tamper with the process in some other way [ See Law: If I'm a juror on a trial and I have a lot of money, can I hire a lawyer to advise me on how to think about the case and my decision? ] If the judge suspects that other jurors will just listen to you and ignore their own views of the case because of your force of personality or specialized knowledge/education, then she'll nix you. This is also part of the reason Mike Rayzman suggesting that you dress nicely and seem busy is not a bad idea (it also makes your time seem more important, in line w/ 1 above). Aside from sounding intelligent, well-spoken, and persuasive, you can also drop hints that you have specific legal knowledge of things like jury nullification (which jurors are not supposed to know about). A judge or lawyer who explains jury nullification to a jury generally results in a mistrial [2 again]. It's a power that the jury has but one that they are not supposed to be aware of. Knowledge / Familiarity with the case : Demonstration of other, non-legal types of knowledge can also save you. When they read the names of the parties and the witnesses at the beginning , pay close attention because if you're acquainted with any of them, you're disqualified (e.g., if your husband used to work for the company that's being sued or if you used to be neighbors with one of the witnesses). Knowledge of the area (e.g., if you used to work or live there) could also help, partly because it raises the chances of a conflict (turns out you know someone involved) as the case progresses but also partly because it decreases the chances of you being impartial (e.g., "I've been to that store, and I think it's an outrage it got robbed. Someone's gonna pay for this") [6]. Awareness of media coverage can also be a disqualifying factor (e.g., "I read about that store getting robbed, and I agree with the NYTimes, the perp should be locked up for life!"). So can personal experiences that are similar to the facts of the case (e.g., "I used to work behind the counter in a store just like that one and was in constant fear of a robbery just like that one.") Partiality : In addition to the judge disqualifying you for possible bias, both sides get peremptory challenges [7] whereby they can eliminate potential jurors. I suggest reviewing the links in [3] and other online sources for the factors involved here, but the gist is that you want to seem extreme in some way. If you come off as very anti-establishment or libertarian, then the prosecution in a criminal trial may worry about your willingness to enforce the law. If you seem like a very strict, rules-oriented person, then the defense might fear an overeagerness to punish. Hope this helped, good luck! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voi... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jur... The 1895 decision in Sparf v. U.S. written by Justice John Marshall Harlan held 5 to 4 that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws. This decision, often cited, has led to a common practice by United States judges to penalize anyone who attempts to present a nullification argument to jurors and to declare a mistrial if such argument has been presented to them. In some states, jurors are likely to be struck from the panel during voir dire if they will not agree to accept as correct the rulings and instructions of the law as provided by the judge. [3] Just a few casual examples: http://www.synchronicsgroup.com/... http://www.litigationps.com/liti... http://www.trialgraphix.com/serv... http://keenetrial.com/blog/2010/... http://2b1inc.com/grand-voir-dir... http://www.askmen.com/money/how_... If the authorities want to penalize you, they'll have to prove that you received the letter in the first place -- which is done by signing a registered letter. As long as you don't sign it, you're likely in the clear. Those who don't return the form might include people who were on vacation, have moved, or simply didn't pick up their mail. So if anyone wants to penalize you, be sure to show 'em your tan. By returning the letter, your name is placed in future random selection processes for potential jurors. The 2 page guide in that link is a helpful supplement to my answer as well. even though I don't think I read the newspaper articles that covered this specific incident, I do follow such coverage closely and I think it's a damn shame that neighborhood has deteriorated so badly.

I was on a panel for a trial that made the newspapers (they picked the jury before my turn came) and on another jury which was an interesting decision. Other than they need to pay more it's relatively painless with the one day, one jury system. There is a good chance you will never need to even show up. In any case, my experience was the ones who most wanted to get out were invariably picked for the juries.           Report as inappropriate      12/29/2008                     Elizabeth G.

Sunnyvale, CA           62 friends        0 reviews         It makes me sad, when I read about people who want to duck out of Jury Duty. Please reread what Lauren wrote. I feel that I was lucky to get the Jury I got, when I was falsely accused of a crime. I was accused by a police officer, I had gone to High School with. He claimed not to know me, but he was in my P.E. class in high school. He was a bully than and still is. I was found innocent on one charge, and they dead locked on the second. The DA did not believe the cop in the end. No further charges were ever made. It all started with a minor traffic stop. I felt lucky, that the people listened to my case. - I hope this never happens to you. I could have gone to jail for several years. It is not always bad people that end up in court. - Some are falsely accused. The last time I was called to Jury duty, my dad had just died. They gave me a deferral, and I have not been called since. The time before, I was called, the group of us was in the room waiting to go into the court room, and when the Bailiff told the Judge the Jury was ready, the guy changed his plea to guilty. ( I think he thought the judge would give him a better sentence) We were than excused for that year. The time before that, we the jury I was in, found the guy guilty. It was not even close. We came to the decision in just a few hours. 2 hours ago Lauren C. says: I don't love it either, but it's a privilege as an American citizen to sit on a jury to judge one of your peers.

My advice is even if it would cause a little inconvenience in your life.. if actually do get selected.. don't fight it too hard... as inconvenient as you might find it.. it is a totally worth-while experience which you will probably be happy to have done... then you can Yelp about it... like I did... yelp.com/biz/santa-clara…           Report as inappropriate      12/30/2008                     Vicky T.

Dublin, CA           452 friends        391 reviews         Jury Duty is an inconvenience, true.  But I'm gonna have to agree with the "just do it" folks on here.  It is an honor and a privilege that Americans are allowed to participate in the process of government.  Not all Americans agree, and many things are not to your taste.  You may not always achieve the result you want but at least you have a voice. There are many countries where you can't participate, or you can, but it's a facade covering corruption on a massive Federal scale. The US is for the most part different from this and is comparatively open.  It does mean that we make sacrifices in our individual lives for the sake of the community, city, state, or country.  But considering the alternatives, such sacrifices like Jury Duty or taking the time to vote, are small in comparison.

Must I respond to my jury duty notice? Who may serve as a juror? Will I be paid for jury service? What if the dates of my jury service conflict with my work or vacation schedule? Why have some people never been called for jury duty? May I volunteer for jury service? I lost my juror summons. How do I find out what court summoned me for jury service? How are jurors contacted for service in federal court? Before potential jurors are summoned for service, their names are randomly drawn from voters lists (and sometimes drivers lists) to receive a questionnaire to determine whether they meet the legal qualifications for jury service. Individuals who receive questionnaires are required to complete and return them to the clerk's office, which then screens the completed questionnaires to determine eligibility for jury service. (In some courts, qualification questionnaires and summonses are mailed together.)  Must I respond to my jury duty notice? Yes, it is legally required, and there are penalties for noncompliance. Jurors perform a vital role in the American system of justice. Jury service is an important civic function that supports one of the fundamental rights of citizens - the right to have their cases decided by a jury of their peers.  Who may serve as a juror? The Jury Act, which is set out at Title 28, U.S. Code, Sections 1861-1878, calls for random selection of citizens' names from voters lists or from voter lists supplemented by additional sources (such as drivers lists). Because random selection is required, individuals may not volunteer for service. More on Jury Service  The Act states that individuals are legally disqualified from service:  if they are not a citizen of the United States 18 years old, who has resided for a period of one year within the judicial district;  if they are unable to read, write, and understand the English language with a degree of proficiency necessary to fill out a qualification form;  if they are unable to speak the English language;  if they are incapable by reason of mental or physical infirmity to render jury service; or  if they have felony charges pending against them punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, or they have been convicted of a felony and their civil rights have not been restored.   In addition, the Jury Act lists three groups that are exempt from federal jury service:  members of the armed forces on active duty;  members of professional fire and police departments; and  "public officers" of federal, state or local governments, who are actively engaged in the performance of public duties.   Persons belonging to these groups may not serve on federal juries, even if they so desire.  Will I be paid for jury service? Yes, federal jurors are paid $40 a day. (Employees of the federal government are paid their regular salary in lieu of this fee.) In most courts, jurors also are reimbursed for reasonable transportation expenses and parking fees.  Your employer may continue your salary during all or part of your jury service, but federal law does not require an employer to do so. Nonetheless, the Jury Act forbids any employer from firing, intimidating, or coercing any permanent employee because of their federal jury service.  What if the dates of my jury service conflict with my work or vacation schedule? The Jury Act allows courts to grant temporary deferrals of service on the grounds of "undue hardship or extreme inconvenience." The qualification questionnaire and juror summons provides specific information on how to request a deferral from your individual court. Whether to grant a deferral is a matter of discretion for the court and cannot be reviewed or appealed to Congress or any other entity.  Why have some people never been called for jury duty? Eligibility for federal jury service is dependent both upon an individual meeting the legal qualifications for service and upon the random chance of having one's name drawn from the source lists.  Each judicial district must have a formal written plan for the selection of jurors, which provides for random selection from a fair cross-section of the community in the district, and which prohibits discrimination in the selection process. Voter records - either voter registration lists or lists of actual voters - are the required source of names for federal court juries. Some courts supplement voter lists with other sources, such as lists of licensed drivers. A copy of a district's jury plan is available for review in the clerk's office.  In addition, many courts offer excuses from service, on individual request, to designated groups of persons or occupational classes. Such groups may include persons over age 70; persons who have, within the past two years, served on a federal jury; and persons who serve as volunteer fire fighters or members of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.  May I volunteer for jury service? While the federal courts appreciate your willingness in participating in jury service, you cannot volunteer to serve. Each judicial district must randomly select potential jurors from a fair cross-section of the community in the district, and discrimination in the selection process is prohibited.  I lost my juror summons. How do I find out what court summoned me for jury service? You may have been called to serve from your local federal court, or a state or other local court in your community. Unfortunately, there is not one place you can go to research the different court systems. To see if you’ve been called to serve on a federal jury, you must contact the local federal district court in your community. Find your local court using the Court Locator .
