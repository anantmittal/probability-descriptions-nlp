But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 — yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes!

One in 10? One in 50? One in 100? If you're over 62, your odds of having at least $1 million in net wealth (your total assets minus your total debt) are relatively achievable — about 1 in 7. But if you are under 40, your odds are low: 1 in 55. In the last 25 years, the odds that an old person is a millionaire have improved slightly. But for young people, they have gotten much worse. These figures come from a new paper by economists at the St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability, which shows evidence of a growing wealth gap that few people are talking about — the gap between the young and the old. The paper, by William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, draws on surveys of 40,000 families that the Fed carried out between 1989 and 2013 to examine the all-important role that your age plays in how much income you make and how much wealth you accumulate. It offers a few clues as to how young people can game the system and end up like their wealthy older counterparts, as well as a lot of evidence to show that things are just different for young people today. One of the most important points that the paper makes is that everyone's income and wealth tend to follow a kind of natural pattern during their life. Young people (generally defined here as those under 40) haven't been working for many years, so they don't have an opportunity to save as much; they also need to make investments in things like education and new home ownership. Middle-aged people (40-61) have been working long enough that they start to accumulate wealth rapidly. And old people (62 and up) begin to draw down on their wealth, to finance their retirement. You can see these trends in this incredible graph below, from their paper. People born in different years (1901, 1904, 1907 and so on) were surveyed at various times between 1989 and 2013 about their median family income. The chart below shows their age on the horizontal axis, and the median family income they reported making at the time on the vertical axis. The slope of each of the different colored lines shows how income was changing for that group between 1989 and 2013. For example, for the youngest generations, who appear on the left-hand side of the graph, the lines sharply slope upward because their net income is rising. World Economic Forum Here's the same graph for wealth (assets minus debt), rather than income. If you compare this with the previous chart, you can see that net worth takes a longer time to amass than income, and then declines less slowly. That's partly because a lot of people take on debt at the beginning of their lives — student debt, mortgages, etc — and thus have negative net worth. It's also because people lose their incomes as they retire, but tend to hold on to their largest sources of net worth, like their homes. World Economic Forum From bad to worse Basically, young people have always been poor. But looking beyond that basic trend, you can see that today's young people are poorer than young people of the past. The period of time in which someone is born can also have a dramatic effect on their wealth compared with other generations. The winners of this historical jackpot appear to be those who were born between 1930 and 1945 and came of age after World War II, who are sometimes called The Silent Generation. Both the Silent Generation and the generation that came before them, called The Greatest Generation because they fought in World War II, benefited from America's rapid economic growth after World War II. (As Thomas Piketty describes in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, this was not necessarily a happy story: The U.S. grew so fast after World War II because it was the only place in the world with manufacturing capacity - Europe had literally been leveled.) But The Silent Generation appears to get an additional boost because they were born during the Great Depression, a time when people had fewer babies overall. Their lower population meant that they had less competition overall for jobs, housing, investments and other opportunities. Sociologist Elwood Carlson called the generation "the lucky few" because they were smaller than the generation that came before. African-Americans and women born in those years had far more opportunity, and the generation also benefited from the expansion of the American safety net, including Social Security and Medicare, during their lives. YouTube/The Pilion Trust Charity "People born in the first half of the 20th century simply may have been in the right place at the right time as they were lifted by a rising tide," the economists write. Then came the Baby Boomers, the populous generation born after World War II. They haven't fared as well as their predecessors, in part because their greater numbers have meant more competition, and perhaps in part because the world is just a different place. The Boomers were the first generation to really experience the effects of globalization and competition from workers in the developing world. That, as well as automation and the decline of labor unions have all eroded wage growth on the lower end of the income spectrum. The charts below illustrate this difference. A sliver of the Greatest Generation, born in 1915-1917, is represented on the far right side of both graphs in teal. Part of the Silent Generation (born 1933-1935) appears in cornflower blue, while some Boomers (born 1954-1956) appear in beige. The horizontal axis shows the person's age, and the vertical axis shows their income (on the left) or median net worth (on the right). If you look at Figure 3 on the right, you can see how much better the Silent Generation did than the generations that came before or after them. Notice where the blue line overlaps with the teal line — that shows that those born between 1933 and 1935 had a much higher net worth in their 70's than those born between 1915 and 1917. In the same graph, the overlap between the blue line and the beige line shows that the Silent Generation also had a higher net worth than the Boomers did when both generations were in their mid to late 50's. World Economic Forum William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability In just 25 years, the wealth gap between young and old people has yawned wider. In 1989, old families had 7.6 times as much median wealth as young families. By 2013, it had grown to 14.7 times. According to the economists' calculations, someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than an identical person born in 1940. It's not clear exactly why this is, the economists say. The financial crisis and Great Recession certainly set young people back, but young people were doing comparatively worse even before that. And the trends are true even though America's younger generations are its most educated ever. Part of the reason could be that younger Americans are far more diverse than older generations, and race- and ethnicity-based disadvantages continue to loom large in the U.S., the economists say. White and Asian families are far wealthier than black and Hispanic families in the U.S., across all age groups. Flickr The difference may also be due to the difference in financial decisions between young and old people. Old people generally have more diverse investments, carry less debt and are more cushioned against financial shocks than younger people. If young people want to increase their chances of being wealthy, one strategy is to emulate the behavior of older people: keeping an emergency fund, paying down debt, avoiding high-cost credit, and putting money into higher-returning investments, the economists say. One strategy that might work for young people is delaying the purchase of a house. By doing so, young people can save and make a bigger down payment later, and thus lower their debt burden, as well as make more diverse investments in the interim. But even if Millennials and Gen Xers follow these strategies, the historical trends don't appear to be on their side. "Some people are just born lucky," the economists conclude.

From: Best Health Care Degrees      Your Chances of Dying  The National Center for Health Statistics reports the average life expectancy in the
United States is 77.9 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
the leading causes of death in the United States are (in descending order) heart disease,
cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, Alzheimer's disease and
diabetes. (ref: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm ) There are so many ways to die early; from risky outdoor activities to smoking.  At Best Health Degrees we decided to take a look at just how much you increase your chances of dying through these activities.  Life after all is one big series of risks.  And some risks are worth the shot. One study
shows people have a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying while attending a dance party. Another
study shows the odds of dying while skydiving in the United States is 1 in 101,083
jumps. What follows is a list of activities, from the ordinary to the extraordinary, and
your chances of dying from them. Sports and Recreational Activities  Overall, snow boarding fatality rate: 0.455 per million participant visits.

third weekend for two days for a year are: 35 days/year x 2.5 deaths/year / 37,500
climber-days/year or 1/429 (John Dill, article about death and injury in Yosemite 1970
through 1990). The mortality rates among trekkers in Nepal during two periods between 1984 and 1991:
0.014 and 0.015 per 100 trekkers. On Denali, the highest mountain in Alaska: 0.308 deaths for every 100 mountaineers who
register with the National Park Service. On Mt. Rainier: Estimated mortality rate of approximately 0.031 per 100 mountaineers. Climbing above 6000 m in the Himalayas: 10 to 12.6 deaths for every 100 mountaineers.

Women who smoke are 12 times more likely to die from the disease. Smoking triples the
risk of dying from heart disease among middle-aged men and women. People who smoke
increase their risk of death from emphysema and bronchitis by almost 10 times. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Lifelong smokers on average have a 50 percent chance of dying from tobacco-related
illnesses, with half of them dying before the age of 70. Studies show cigar smokers have
4-10 times the risk of nonsmokers of dying from laryngeal, oral, or esophageal cancers. (Source: Oral Cancer Foundation ) People who had a medium number of years lived with obesity (between five years and
14.9 years), the risk of mortality more than doubled than for people who had never
been obese. The risk of mortality almost tripled for those with the longest duration

of obesity (more than 15 years) (Source: Monash University researchers ) Miscellaneous  Dance parties: 1 in 100,000 chance of dying Table games: 1 in 100 million chance of dying Computer games: 1 in 100 million chance of dying

years from now according to British actuary Benjamin Gompertz in 1825; it's called
the "Gompertz Law of human mortality." Your probability of dying during a given year
doubles every 8 years.

The chances of you being conceived to become who you are (that is, that one particular egg meeting that single sperm; nice imagery for you there) is 1 in 4 quadrillion . The odds of your lineage remaining unbroken long enough to create you: 1 in 10[45,000]. That’s my incredibly unclear way of writing 10 with 45,000 zeros after it, so I don’t fill up this entire page with 0’s. This means that every single one of your ancestors also had to be conceived to become exactly who they were, so that scales the chance of you existing down to 1 in 10[2,640, 000]. When you calculate all of these possibilities and chances, the chances of you existing right now as you are (presumably with a huge headache after reading this) is basically zero .

Ali Binazir went to a Tedx talk in San Francisco and heard some probabilities being bandied about that he considered dubious:  One of the talks was by Mel Robbins , a riotously funny self-help author and life coach with a syndicated radio show.  In it, she mentioned that scientists calculate the probability of your existing as you, today, at about one in 400 trillion (4×10 14 ).  “That’s a pretty big number,” I thought to myself.  If I had 400 trillion pennies to my name, I could probably retire.  Previously, I had heard the Buddhist version of the probability of ‘this precious incarnation’.  Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere.  The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — into the middle of that life preserver. On one try.  Like a good skeptic, Binazir first calculated the turtle-head-into-life-preserver probability, making due allowances for the area of the world’s oceans and the area of the hole in a life preserver. That turns out to be 1 in 6.82×10 14 , or about 1 in 700 trillion. Pretty close to the probability-that-you-exist-figure.  But when Binazir calculated the second figure, he found out that Robbins was off. Way off. But Binazir made that calculation, too, which of course involves some ancillary assumptions and calculations. The probability that you’d exist on Earth today includes the probability that your parents would meet 20 years ago, that they’d have a relationship that would result in pregnancy, and of course that the right egg would meet the right sperm.  But it also includes the probability that your parents would also have existed with the genes they have, which means calculating that every one of your ancestors would have reproduced successfully , and that for each pair of them the right egg would have met the right sperm as well.  He comes up with this probability that you’d exist (by “you”, of course, he means those individuals resulting from the concatenation of a sperm and egg genetically to those who formed your zygote:  Probability of your existing at all: 1 in 10 2,685,000  As a comparison, the number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg, 175 lb) is 10 27 .  The number of atoms making up the earth is about 10 50 .  The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at 10 80 .  So what’s the probability of your existing?  It’s the probability of 2 million people getting together – about the population of San Diego – each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up the exact same number – say, 550,343,279,001.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible.  By that definition, I’ve just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and act like the miracle that you are.  Well, somebody’s going to point out to me that although the specific genetic “you” who exists is improbable, the probability that some you, that is, some offspring of your lineage that could be reading this piece, is much higher. Others will pick nits and question Binazir’s calculations. (Given that the number of chromosomes is limited, the probability of getting an individual nearly identical to you is higher.)  But the principle is still the same: it shows the fallacy of the anthropic principle—or of Douglas Adams’s self-reflecting puddle .  But it’s still a cool calculation nonetheless. The read probablity that you exist, of course, is 1.  Ali Binazir’s website, Smart ideas for smart living , is here .  h/t: Matthew Cobb  Share this: Tweet Like this: Like  Loading...

I wonder if they sell great big clubs with Bayes’ theorem printed on the business end.          Orlando   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:38 am |  Permalink   It reminds me of the court cases on TV where the prosecution argues that the odds of another person having the same DNA is several billion to one and therefore not possible.  Well, by that argument, if the odds of winning a lottery are several billion to one and you win, then you must give up your winnings because the odds are so high it was impossible.  They confuse improbable with impossible and over long periods of time or with large enough numbers, the very improbable does happen.          Dr. I. Needtob Athe   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:26 am |  Permalink   It may seem like a nit-pick, but when the odds of something happening are several billion to one, that means it’s extremely likely, not unlikely. If the odds AGAINST something happening are high then that means it’s improbable.  To put it in mathematical terms, if you subtract one from the reciprocal of the probability that something will happen, you get the odds that it won’t happen.              chance   Posted November 11, 2011 at 7:58 am |  Permalink   *the REAL probability that you exist (typo in the final sentence there, you can delete this post once you fix it 😮          Julien Rousseau   Posted November 11, 2011 at 4:34 pm |  Permalink   But he must first read your post to correct the typo read for real.

Cheers,  b&          Dominic   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:04 am |  Permalink   The universe is information. This is why a god makes no sense – it would have to have more information than the universe. Am I along the right lines here?          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:10 am |  Permalink   It’s basic set theory.  The omnimax gods are indistinguishable from “the set of all sets.” I mean, that’s the whole point of such gods. Yet it was long ago demonstrated that “the set of all sets” is as meaningless a concept as “the largest (prime) number.”  The best you can do is a pantheist-style equation of “God” with Sagan’s “Cosmos.” But that just leads to confusion, so why bother?  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:10 am |  Permalink   I find this argument very strange.  What you are saying is this:  P1 Some things are in principle unknowable. P2 Omniscience, the notion of knowing everything, includes knowing things that are in principle unknowable. P3 This is incoherent. Ergo, there is no god.  The problem lies in P2.  Why does omniscience have to consist of knowing things that are in principle unknowable?  How has it come to be that you have defined omniscience to mean the set of all sets?  And what makes you think that this principle applies to a deity, which is by definition outside of the laws of the universe?  I am not a theist, nor a deist, and I think the arguments presented by religionists are wrong.  I am an atheist.  But your argument is of the same form as those sophistical paradoxes you see online sometimes: “could god create a rock so heavy even he couldn’t lift it?”  And those are not good arguments.  We could just define omniscience to mean “knowing all things that can in principle be known”.  That is not destroyed by your argument, especially if it means, for instance, knowing the absolute position and momentum of every particle in the universe from beginning to end, which a being unconstrained by the laws of the universe could ‘know’, whatever it means to know something under those conditions.  And that certainly sounds like an attribute a supposed deity would have, even if it can’t count to infinity.  It would also enable that deity to have the knowledge to make moral judgements – so your rejection of the notion of omniscience that you have come up with does no damage to the conventional notion of a deity.  You have attached a strong meaning to the word ‘omniscience’ that enables you to make the a priori judgement that it isn’t coherent.  But perhaps you need to read Quine, “Two Dogmas of Empiricism” (yes, I know – philosophy!), to understand why your argument is actually not a good one, and why your a priori rejection of any deity on the grounds of rejecting a strange supposition, wholly linguistic, of Christian theologians is not reasonable.  There are plenty of excellent arguments against all kinds of deities.  Yours is unfortunately not very good.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:25 am |  Permalink   We could just define omniscience to mean “knowing all things that can in principle be known”.  In so doing, you destroy the meaning of the word, “omnipotence.”  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers. But because it is impossible for me to know such things, and your definition of “omniscience” excludes that which it is impossible for the individual in question to know, my ignorance of tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers cannot be held against my claim of omniscience.  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know the precise number of C14 atoms in some random rock on some random planet circling some random star in the Andromeda galaxy. This ignorance, too, does not disprove my claim of omniscience (using your definition).  Continue down the line, and you quickly discover that, everything that I do not know, it is in principle impossible for me to know. I might well be able to learn it at some point in the future, but my current self cannot, in principle, know such things today.  Therefore, by your definition, I, Ben Goren, am omniscient.  Once you start making excuses for a god’s inability to perform a miracle, those same excuses must be applied to all other entities as well. And, as soon as you start handing out those get-out-of-jail-free cards to all comers, it becomes apparent that, once again, the properties attributed to the gods are meaningless.  Besides. Of what point is a miracle if it’s not an instance of the impossible? Jesus didn’t walk on water because it’s something that a space alien with repulsor sandals could do. He did it because nobody can do it. But, if he really walked on water, then it really was possible…and therefore merely impressive, not miraculous.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:36 am |  Permalink   Your point about miracles is a non-sequitur.  And you need to revise your definition of “in principle”.  You are stating that you cannot in principle know a number of things that you can, in principle, know.  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers.  Yes, you can in principle know that. In principle .  You don’t know it (and if you do, then please let me know asap).  But you could, in principle know that.  Heisenberg has some good arguments about the nature of time that rest on a notion of “in principle” that you reject.  Perhaps you should read his Physics and Philosophy to discover what “in principle” can be taken to mean.  In so doing, you destroy the meaning of the word, “omnipotence.”  No – that is only true if you assume that a deity is both omnipotent and omniscient, and while this is certainly the standard formulation, it doesn’t rule out many kinds of deity.  It just means that a deity that is omniscient is not also omnipotent, and while that has obvious implications (ie, there is no Christian god) it doesn’t rule out a deity that i) created the universe, ii) knows everything knowable, iii) makes moral judgements about actions based on knowledge of knowable things, and iv) consigns people to hell for transgressing its moral judgements.  Apart from the notion that god has the power to rain thunderbolts on your head and give you boils, you’ve left some notion of a deity reasonably intact.  And I think we already knew that omniscience, omnipotence, etc, are incompatible – hence theodicy!  That is the primary problem theologians have (apart from, you know, the utter non-existence of their subject matter).  All you’ve done is to restate this problem and say that it is not resolvable.  You may be right, but that’s not a revelation, and it’s certainly not the best argument for atheism, I’m afraid.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:50 am |  Permalink   You can try to bring all the quantum woo into it you like, but I’m sure Heisenberg, were he here, would assure you that nothing he demonstrated would make possible knowledge outside of one’s relativistic light cone. Tomorrow’s lottery numbers are most emphatically outside that cone.  But never mind that. Permit me to simplify things further.  The very principle of personal knowledge is that one can only know that which is recorded in one’s brain. The process by which such information is recorded is very well known and limited. Once one eliminates that which has not been recorded (or subsequently forgotten) along with that which has never presented the possibility for being recorded, one is left with the set of that which an individual knows being perfectly congruent with the set of that which an individual can, in principle, know. Therefore, by your definition, because there’s no way in principle that the individual could possibly know anything else, everybody is omniscient.  And your claim that it’s possible for an individual to be omniscient (using the traditional naïve definition, not your castrated version) but not omnipotent, but not vice-versa, also falls flat. An omnipotent individual could “use his omnipotence” to make himself omniscient. An omniscient individual would know how to make herself omniscient. Indeed, the two properties are indistinguishable.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:07 am |  Permalink   And your claim that it’s possible for an individual to be omniscient (using the traditional naïve definition, not your castrated version) but not omnipotent, but not vice-versa, also falls flat. An omnipotent individual could “use his omnipotence” to make himself omniscient. An omniscient individual would know how to make herself omniscient. Indeed, the two properties are indistinguishable.  First of all, I didn’t say ‘not vice versa’.  Nor did I say that an ‘individual’ could be omniscient.  Given the attenuated definition of omniscience that I discussed – one that is still undeniably the property of a ‘deity’ – it is not possible to know how to make yourself omnipotent, because that is in principle unknowable.  But even given your strong version of omniscience, it does not follow than an omniscient being would be able to make itself omnipotent.  It might actually know how, but knowledge of how to do something doesn’t equal capability to do that thing.  It could know how to make itself omnipotent without actually being able to do it.  Either way, it doesn’t hold.  If we define ‘omniscience’ as being ‘knowledge of the position and momentum of every particle in the universe from beginning to end’, which is in principle knowable (ie, it doesn’t turn into knowledge of incoherent things like the largest prime number or the set of all sets), then this is a coherent property, even if it is impossible in the universe (materially, due to recursion).  That means that you can’t reject it due to a priori speculation.  To provide an example of a deity that is not both omniscient and omnipotent, and one that was worshipped for thousands of years by the world’s most powerful empire, I give you Ahura Mazda (or, in Middle Persian, Ohrmazd), benevolent deity of the Zoroastrian religion, state religion of the Achaemenid, Arsacid, and Sasanid empires.  Hardly inconsequential!  Ahura Mazda is supposed to have created the universe; it is supposed to know everything; it is supposed to make moral judgements; but it is not supposed to be omnipotent, because it has no control over ‘evil’ things, which are the domain of Angra Manyu (MP Ahriman).  There was a religious movement in the Sasanian era to confound this – this was notably after the rise of Christianity.  An omnipotent deity was proposed, named Zurvan, who was supposed to have created both Angra Manyu and Ahura Madza.  There was a schism, of course.  There always is.  My point is, if that argument is all you have to go on (and I’m sure it’s not, but….), then you couldn’t be a Zurvanite, but you could be a Zoroastrian.          Chris V.   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:45 pm |  Permalink   Wait what? Omniscient means “all-knowing”, right? You cannot circumscribe that. The largest prime is not “unknowable”, it simply does not exist. That’s the answer that your omniscient being would give you. The same with your set-of-all-sets; it is simply recursive. It may cause problems for your garden-variety omnipotent being, but not your omniscient ones.            Occam   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:46 pm |  Permalink   “I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know the precise number of C14 atoms in some random rock on some random planet…”  Small matter of principle indeed, Ben: 14C-isotopes are only assimilated by carbon-based life forms, and therefore found only in fossilised remains thereof (or of their rejections, such as coprolites) or carbonate deposits, and only down to a detection limit of 10-15 half lives, i.e. 55-75 Ky, after which there is hardly any radiocarbon left. Hence, unless carbon-based life forms would have existed whithin that time frame on that random planet around that random star in the Andromeda galaxy, the detectable number of 14C-isotopes on a random “rock” there (organic fossil or piece of carbonate sediment, rather) would be ~zero. An omniscient being would have known that 🙂            Gabrielle Guichard   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:37 pm |  Permalink   (Outside the topic) I wonder how many believers think that what defines a deity is to be “outside of the laws of the universe”. Most think that a god cannot be defined.          David Gerard   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:42 pm |  Permalink   I’m really not convinced they think that far. “Sophisticated theology” is actually a rarity, for all its practitioners hide behind it. Most believers have a very simple theology based on God being the being with the power of magic. God as “undefinable” is a very recent invention, starting when science really started kicking religion’s ass.          Tom Dobrzeniecki   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:06 am |  Permalink   I didn’t consider your remark “outside the topic”.  I was going to make a similar comment regarding God being the “set of all sets” argument being made above.  I was raised with a lot of religious training (currently an atheist!), so I know that a common faith-based reply to these arguments would indeed be: God is outside the bounds of our limited knowledge of the rules of the universe, and is able to revise those rules if He sees fit.

The omnimax gods are indistinguishable from “the set of all sets.” […] Yet it was long ago demonstrated that “the set of all sets” is [a] meaningless […] concept….  Actually, there are set theories which do have  a “universal set” (a set of all sets, including itself), for example Quine’s New Foundations set theory.  And many set theories which lack a set of all sets do have a “proper class” of all sets, where “proper classes” are entities larger than “sets”.            Torbjorn Larsson, OM   Posted November 12, 2011 at 2:24 pm |  Permalink   The universe has access to “more information than the universe” contains in Many World Theory – quantum algorithms (QA) employ not yet fully decohered worlds to arrive at results.  Hence a QA that uses the observable universe would access more information than the universe contains.  I think Dawkins, as so many times, nailed it – design theory demands that a creator has more information than the created, and the infinite regress of creators is hence absurd twice over (infinite and infinitely demanding).

But at the same time, getting *any* specific hand is improbable too, given the number of cards and ways they can be arranged.  Its just that we find certain patterns to be ‘random’ and certain patterns to be meaningful.  The same could be considered with each human being born.

Sastra   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:14 am |  Permalink   The Fine Tuning Argument for God has always seemed to me to be one of the weakest and silliest of the arguments. Yet I’ve seen wised and learned atheists spending plenty of time on it, doing calculations and invoking multiple universes — all to get that number down so that the life-allowing properties of the universe becomes less ‘extraordinary’ and therefore more probable.  Doesn’t the whole argument fail before you even get to the calculations and odds, though? I’m not a statistician, but it may not be a matter of statistics. Mel Robbin’s talk on ‘this precious incarnation’ or whatever helps to highlight why.  Here’s the basic set-up of the FTA:  1.) Pick out something that YOU think is special and important — for any reason you want. It could be the life-allowing properties of the universe; it could be life itself; it could be you; it could be the elephant’s trunk; it could be a leaf falling on a particular spot on the sidewalk at 12:05 pm; it could be a single speck of sand on a planet in another galaxy; it could be the speck of sand to the right of that one. Whatever. Select it with reverence.  2.)Now, going back to the beginning of time (or as far as possible), think of all the things that might have happened to prevent this special, important thing from happening. Consider all the different ways things could have been, for all you know. Invoke the multiverse, if you want, as well as all the quantum events and their clouds of probability.  3.) Come up with some calculation of the odds against the special, important thing. For the sake of brevity, we could say it’s going to be something perilously close to ‘infinity to the infinity power …minus one.’  4.) Good. Gape in awe at your discovery: this special, important thing was clearly selected with reverence … by someone . WHO could that someone BE? Who might have picked out something they thought was special and important in advance of what we find after the fact?  Ummmm… can we look at step 1 and hazard a guess?  The whole damn process just seems circular to me. It wouldn’t seem to matter what was selected and what the probabilities are or how they are calculated. The results will be the same. The whole weight and purpose and import of Fine Tuning or ‘precious incarnation’ or any other process that looks at the odds and calculates a miracle is in that first step . In an elaborate and unnecessary scenario, something you select is discovered to have been something selected. A=A.  Am I missing something more critical here?

It’s my understanding that even if the universe is fine-tuned to support life, we are a biased sample because we would have to be alive to think about it. Further, improbable stuff happens all the time, and we don’t even know the prior probability of getting our universe, so our universe is either not improbable, or it is but that doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen.  In other words, the multiverse hypothesis is completely unnecessary in answering the fine-tuning argument, cause it’s a shit argument.”  It’s Statistics 101 that stuff with a very low prior probability happens all the time.

Torbjorn Larsson, OM   Posted November 12, 2011 at 1:30 pm |  Permalink   The Finetuning Argument is a different beast than the Anthropic Argument though. (Which in turn differs from bona fide anthropic principles).  It can certainly be cast as the general odds-against as you did, which is an Anthropic Argument large number fallacy. But it can specifically ask about finetuning for life , which is a sensible question. (Which again differs from bona fide physics finetuning of models.)  However then there is also a sensible answer, which turns out to be bad for believers: the likelihood for any form of livable conditions is actually rather high. And in any case the weak anthropic principle, as it applies in such cases of changing parameters, would circumvent any small a priori probabilities.            Dr. I.

It’s actually a reasonable question: do I actually exist?  Certainly in ordinary language I do, and so do you, but there are very good arguments for saying that no, I don’t, and neither do you – at least, not in the same way as elementary particles exist.  Look up “mereological nihilism” on wiki, for instance, or find Trenton Merricks’ book, Objects and Persons .  It is not such a wacky idea that you do not exist, even if it seems it.  It is certainly much more reasonable than it sounds, and is not destroyed by begging the question.

Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:59 am |  Permalink   No, it is not “idiotic in the extreme”.  Is the you that exists today the same you that existed yesterday, or five minutes ago, or will exist (hopefully) in ten days time, or the same you that was birthed by your mother?  I don’t doubt that is a causal connection between all of these states, and that the stuff that made up them all actually does exist, but unless they are all exactly the same thing, you cannot say that “you” exist, because your exact properties, including causal properties, are not always the same.  You reduce to a number of parts which are not you – and so you are at most a fleeting composite.  That is not ‘existence’ in the same way that a lepton ‘exists’, and so the terms are not interchangeable salva veritate.  So we need more terms.  Either the lepton can be said to exist, or you can, but not both without considerable ambiguity or even nonsense.  Leptons exist; you… supervene?  I don’t know.  Any term will do.  But yeah, you’re right.  Dismiss it because it’s philosophy, and philosophy, as everyone knows (surely!), is just stupid.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:13 am |  Permalink   The lepton is also constantly changing — it is always in motion, it might be part of different atomic configurations, and so on.  Your concern here is an entirely theological one. Yes, theological — it’s only by presuming the existence of an immaterial soul (or its philosophical analogue, the Platonic ideal) that one can even begin to get tripped up by the gnats you’re straining at here with “Do I exist?” That your woo is labeled “philosophy” rather than “religion” doesn’t decrease the bullshit content in the slightest.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:19 am |  Permalink   Ha!  I’m not the one proclaiming so readily that ‘I’ exist as a thing irreducible to little parts.  You are.  You are saying, outright, that you exist.  That is the presupposition of someone who believes in an immaterial soul.  All I’m trying to do is make the idea of existence reasonable given what is known about the universe.  How you have managed to derive the notion that I believe in an immaterial soul from this is beyond my powers – it seems like madness.  It is the absolute direct opposite of what I have just said, which is that I probably don’t exist as an independent entity in the universe.  The lepton is also constantly changing — it is always in motion, it might be part of different atomic configurations, and so on.  Yes – but the lepton is the part , not the thing composed.  That is the difference.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:51 am |  Permalink   I’m sorry, but you’re making even less sense now.  I’ve never made any claim that the self is irreducible to little parts, and I laughed at the idiocy of souls in the post you’re replying to. And now you’re declaring that leptons are somehow not “things.”  Regrettably, every conversation I’ve ever had with a philosophy evangelist quickly deteriorates into such incomprehensible blather. How quickly it degenerates from all-knowing immaterial minds that can’t know what it’s like to forget something and all-powerful ghosts that can’t feel powerless to subatomic particles that apparently now don’t exist, either.  You’ll excuse me when I categorize all this as yet another religion, closely related to the religion of Theology, and dismiss it as an utter waste of time. Or maybe you won’t excuse me. I really don’t care.  Cheers,  b&            Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:05 pm |  Permalink   The reason you think I’m making less sense is because you’ve decide to mutilate my points and misunderstand them, seemingly on purpose.  Only that could allow for the crazy things you’ve just said.  Leptons are things – they are elementary particles, and they are irreducible (at least at present).  Their properties are constant, especially their causal properties.  Leptons exist, unambiguously and without qualification.  The same cannot be said for human beings, which have constantly changing properties made up of and reducing to a series of smaller parts with their own properties.  That is the argument that is being made.  Do you see anything in there about souls?  I don’t, and I have no idea how you managed to come up with that.  There are no souls.  There are no essences.  There are elementary particles in various quantities, arranged in certain ways, with their own properties.  Those exist.  Everything else… well, it’s somewhat more debatable.  And I’m not a ‘philosophy evangelist’.  The fact remains that you see fit to pontificate on philosophical issues while having the capability at abstract thinking, it seems, of a sponge.  Philosophy is not a religion.  It isn’t even a thing.  It’s just the name for this kind of abstract thinking.  I note, also, that you haven’t bothered to defend your claim that you unambiguously exist.  I assume that is because it would require that you outline your belief in an essence or soul, something that defines who you are without reference to properties or causal states or anything real.          DV   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:51 pm |  Permalink   “so you are at most a fleeting composite”  Do composites exist? If yes then you exist. What’s the problem?          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:08 pm |  Permalink   First of all, it’s not as simple as that.  I stated it too simply.  You are not simply one composite: you are a great series of incredibly complex composites, each different from the last in properties, from birth to death.  So even if composites, or wholes, can be held to exist, then the issue is still not settled for human beings.  If we say that “I exist” because we can accept that some wholes might exist, then we’re jumping the gun.  You could be a whole, but in a moment your component parts will be different, and so will the arrangement of those parts.  So even if composites ‘exist’, we have a number of composites rather than just one.  And to talk about all of these composites, whose causal properties might reduce to their component parts, as being the same thing – hmm, no dice.  Secondly, if we use the same word, “exist”, for both the irreducible things that make up the whole and the whole itself, then we are being ambiguous.  Third, the discussion comes down to causal properties.  An electron always has the same properties.  One electron is interchangeable in every way with another, because the causal properties of electrons are always the same.  They are little bits of the universe that do not reduce to other bits, and the properties of things made up of electrons fundamentally reduce to the properties of the electrons (or other elementary particles, etc).  If there is something with causal properties that are more than the sum of its parts, then we can talk unambiguously about that thing existing.  Some people have argued that people have causal properties that are more than the sum of their parts while accepting mereological nihilism in every other aspect.  This is called partial mereological nihilism .  Its chief proponent is Trenton Merricks, IIRC.  His book Objects and Persons outlines the idea of mereological nihilism as well as the possibility that consciousness and intention are causal properties that do not reduce to component parts – and that therefore, people can be said to exist, in a sense, albeit not one that allows for personal identity in the way we expect.  I am on the fence about that.  But regardless, it is hardly an easy topic, nor one that can be dismissed out of hand.          Filippo   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:07 pm |  Permalink   “partial mereological nihilism”  Consulting my best dictionary (but apparently inadequate, as I do not see “mereology”):  “mere” – “pure,” “unmixed”  Related to “merge”?  So is it “partial, pure nihilism”?          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:13 pm |  Permalink   Mereology – μέρος is the root.  It means “part”.  I believe Lesniewski coined the term.  It refers to the study of part/whole relations, and it’s a branch of mathematics as well as a philosophical branch.  I suggest consulting wiki – there is doubtless an article on mereology, and probably one on partial mereological nihilism.  Mereological nihilism is the view that only irreducible parts exist; anything consisting of irreducible parts with no new causal properties is not a thing, and cannot be spoken of as existing.  It is a popular view, because it seems to be the most reasonable, but it comes in a few flavours.  Partial mereological nihilism is that only a limited number of special things exist beyond their constituent parts.  This usually means: humans, or things with intentionality/consciousness/intention, etc.            Torbjorn Larsson, OM   Posted November 12, 2011 at 2:16 pm |  Permalink   and philosophy, as everyone knows (surely!), is just stupid.

Knowing that there is no essential part, no soul, no thing that is unambiguously you without reducing to something else – yes, that seems to give comfort, and has done since Epicurus pointed it out.  The best elucidation, and by far the most beautiful, of this thesis is to be found in Lucretius, De Rerum Natura .              Tom Dobrzeniecki   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:43 am |  Permalink   Occam’s “who is asking the question” makes me think of Descartes.  I always thought that the highly-praised “I think therefore I am” assumes a lot more than it proves.  Who is observing the thinking?  Who concludes that thinking = existence?

Xenithrys   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:26 am |  Permalink   Would another approach to this estimation be to consider the probability of all my alleles being drawn together from the gene pool?  It’s a multi-dimensional Punnett square.  I’d guess it’s a bit more likely than 1 in 10^2,685,000. Factoring in the probability of all my actual ancestors isn’t necessary; I could be me—well, genetic me—with different parents so long as they both carried my alleles among theirs.          Chet   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:21 pm |  Permalink   The read probablity that you exist, of course, is 1.  Uh, no, it’s not. The probability of an outcome isn’t influenced by the fact that it already happened. There’s still (1-p) versions of you that could have existed but don’t.  The probability of rolling a “6” on a six-sided die is one in six, even if its sitting there showing a 6.          Tim Martin   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:36 pm |  Permalink   The probability of anything is based on what you already know of it.  If you ask what was the probability of a person with your genetic code coming into existence at the moment your dad ejaculated inside your mom, the answer would be 1/280 million or less, since the sperm that became you was one of 280 million in that ejaculate (and there was always the possibility that none of them would have fertilized the egg, or the embryo would not have implanted, thus 1/280 million or less ).  If you ask what was the probability of a person with your genetic code coming into existence at any time before that moment, we have to calculate the probability of that moment occurring (and the moment that led to that moment occurring, and so on), so the chances just get worse and worse the more unknowns you let into the equation.  There is no single answer to the question “what is the probability of X?” It depends on what you know about the problem. And if you know that X has already happened, then the probability of X are exactly 1, every time.          Tom Dobrzeniecki   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:32 am |  Permalink   Chet: I would disagree. To the extent that it makes sense to speak of the probability of an event that has already happened, the probability of the die being a “6” after it is rolled and has come up as “6” is one.  The probability of a another “6” coming up on SUBSEQUENT rolls is 1/6.  Those are two different things.  As Mr. Gerard wrote in comment #1, probability really deals with the state of knowledge of the observer with regard to some future event.  I already know the first roll has come up “6”.  I DON’T know how future rolls will come up, so the probability is 1/6 for those.

As nearly every cell in our bodies is replaced every three months (I am not sure about bones and teeth – do carbonate structures count as living cells?) the only continuous thing that we have is our memories, and even then they can be faulty.  Besides, I don’t have any evidence that Dr. I. Needtob Athe or anyone else here really exists, as we could all be an elaborate construction of Jerry’s Website.

It should be shunned, aside from its utility as an instructive exercise about the pitfalls of such probabilistic calculations.  What’s the probability that in a single-split experiment, a particle will hit the screen where it’s observed? Zero! Or one chance in ∞. Or, if you prefer, one chance in 10^∞. (And certainly not the a posteriori probability 1.) So what?  Really specious apologetics from sophisticated Oxonian theologians rest on awful quantifications like this. I was personally introduced via a fomer minister’s-daughter girlfriend to equivalently meaningless calculations on the probability that Jesus is God made by Josh McDowell in his books. Let’s not give any credibility to nonsensical calculations, no matter who makes them.          RFW   Posted November 12, 2011 at 5:28 am |  Permalink   It seems to me that the question is deeply flawed. At the very least “you” and “exist” are not clearly and objectively defined. And I’m not even sure that “probability” is a valid concept in the present context.  Jerry, in one of his earlier paragraphs, posits a definition of “you” that includes parentage back to the beginning of time, but from where I sit, a more reasonable definition is that “you” is distinguished by a particular combination of genes. [Note that this leaves out of the question non-genetic aspects of development, but if the definition of “you” includes “did your mother eat a lot of peanut butter during pregnancy?” then the whole issue falls to the ground in a welter of meaninglessness.]  The question, as I see it, thus becomes (a) how many genes are there in the human genome and (b) how many alleles does each gene have? IOW, how many genetically distinct humans are possible? The probability — if the concept is meaningful in this context — then becomes 1/(number of possible genetically distinct individuals).  I have no idea how many genes there are in the H. sap. genome, nor how many alleles there are for each one. Even if we just have an average number of alleles per gene, an approximation is possible. Anyone have the numbers handy?  PS: In this formulation of the question, note that “you” is not necessarily unique. In particular, identical twins are the same “you”.          sailor1031   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:57 am |  Permalink   Best not to overthink this.

But the principle is still the same: it shows the fallacy of the anthropic principle—or of Douglas Adams’s self-reflecting puddle.  Those are two different things, the a posteriori scientific anthropic principle and the a priori religious anthropic argument. The fallacy belongs to the latter, while the former is untouched by it.  I would like for scientists to acknowledge what physics have to say about this. The weak anthropic principle is the observation that if parameter varies, the likeliest spot to find observers is where the parameters are compatible with them. That is why, for example, we found life on Earth and not on the Moon.  The anthropic argument is a large number argument fallacy: large number, therefore gods. It is based on the scam that a priori probabilities has anything to say on a posteriori probabilities. Or in other word that we should find life on both Earth and the Moon.  In this context, I would think that applying WAP on an individual, let us call it the Coyne Anthropic Principle, would say that it is likeliest to find Coyne’s parents and not other couples as responsible for Coyne’s birth. Which seems like something with a likelihood on the order of ~ 1. =D  The WAP, in the form of generalized environmental principles (looking for star or dust production) is currently the most predictive theories post-standard cosmology. I refer to Boussou :  “Using the entropic principle (the assumption that entropy production traces the formation of complex structures such as observers), we derive six predictions that apply to the whole landscape.”          Josh Whalen   Posted November 26, 2012 at 3:32 am |  Permalink   I find it unlikely it is the “moment in time” that I exist, not “that” I exist.

Future(s) Studies (colloquially called "future(s)" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s).  One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

Also, today there are more humans alive than there were ever before.  Now, let's look at the total timeline of humanity. How long that timeline will extend into the future from today we cannot say for sure. But if it did extend a lot further, and humanity did some day evolve, colonize the stars and so on, that would probably mean there would be a LOT more humans (or sentient beings, to be more general) then. Looking at the total hypothetical timeline from today to the extinction of the universe, this would mean that maybe only 0.01% of all humans were alive in the year 2015. If that were the case, it would be highly unlikely for a sentient being on earth to be alive in the year 2015. Right?  However, we are alive. That makes me believe that it's more likely that there is no future where humanity (or any other species for that matter) will thrive and colonize. Because if that were, we'd most likely exist in that future. In other words: We are alive now because now is the most likely time to be alive. That means it's unlikely there will be very many people alive in the future.  It's kinda a moot point I realize, because every one of us is just a single dice roll, so on a billion sided dice it might be unlikely to land on a number between one and ten, but since we rolled only one time, our life, it's not statistically relevant.

Create an account [–] Lastonk  7 points 8 points 9 points  2 years ago  (1 child) your premise is flawed in multiple places.  current population of the earth 7.1 billion
number of people who have ever lived, about 108 billion  people are living longer and healthier lives, while at the same time are having fewer children. the current extrapolation of the trends is that we will probably reach a population of around ten billion, mostly older people, and stabilize there for some time... even if people live to 150 or 200 years old. this would change dramatically given new conditions (like space colonization or global collapse).  You are also trying to infer that the current data point (being alive today) is invalidated by future data points (A lot more people being alive in the future)  it's like saying that pencil dot in this corner cant exist because there are hundreds of other pencil dots over on this corner... so the odds are against the pencil dot (the one you are looking at) of actually existing.  you further extrapolate that because that pencil dot exists, then the odds must somehow be wrong, and all the other pencil dots must therefore be inaccurate data.   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Upvoted. Statistics are affected by data points not the other way around. So, as unlikely as a data point may have been, once it exists the model is what has to change. This whole post was just a mess of bad assumptions and equivocation.  The chances of having been one of the first hundred human beings is 1 in 1 billion. Since that number is so small, it probably didn't happen at all. Ergo, the first hundred humans must never have existed.   permalink embed save parent [–] dcornett  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (1 child) This was an issue discussed in Sci-Fi author Stephen Baxter's Manifold trilogy.  Here are the possibilities, in my opinion:
1) Probabilistic doomsday is true, and we live in the time most likely to be alive as a human, and in the near future the human race will either be wiped out or will dwindle.  2) We are indeed living in a rare period, and while the original probability of this happening was low, the fact that we do exist means the probability was 100%.  After all, it was incredibly unlikely that I was born in North Carolina, USA, out of the whole world, but yet I was so it had a 100% chance of occurring.  3) humanity lasts into the far future, but as non-organic or post-physical entities. Very little reproduction occurs.  Even in the near future, we see that birth rates decline in prosperous societies.  So if we achieve an abundance of resources here on Earth, and with greatly extended lifetimes, the birthrate could be half of replacement rate.  So, for example, in this scenario many alive today may still be around in a millenium, but very few new humans are born.  More on probabilistic doomsday: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument   permalink embed save give gold [–] hifumi [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Wow! Of course some people have had this thought and have taken it much further than I ever could. Thanks for that link.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children)  Looking at the total hypothetical timeline from today to the extinction of the universe, this would mean that maybe only 0.01% of all humans were alive in the year 2015. If that were the case, it would be highly unlikely for a sentient being on earth to be alive in the year 2015. Right?   Wrong. The conclusion is "it's unlikely for any one individual, chosen at random, to be a member of the 2015 set." Not "it's unlikely for the 2015 set to exist at all."  If you try to look at all data at once like this, the conclusions you draw are in the relationships between points (such as many in 5015 and few in 2015). Not that they contradict each other.   permalink embed save about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

( self.InsightfulQuestions ) submitted 1 year ago by Chrisp_Hansom I'm not here to push my beliefs of not being religious or anything, I just want to know if there any way to actually calculate your existence? (through odds or through scientific studies etc.)  I'm talking like, you were conceived at such a specific time, with that specific sperm and egg cell. What if your father decided to have a date with Pamela Handerson instead of your mum the night of your conception? But also this goes for your parents, and your grandparents and so on. The fact all of us living now must of had relatives who survived wars, famines, natural disasters which could have ended badly. If your relative from 1750 got trampled by a horse and cart as a kid, think how many people wouldn't be alive now and people who those people wouldn't have had children with or effected other lives etc.  I'm not sure if I'm thinking too much into it, but it's something I've been pondering for a year or so now.   19 comments share save hide report all 19 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

Even the odds that you receive exactly the combination of genes from your parents that made you is ~1 in (2 23 ) 2 or 1 in 70 trillion. And that had to happen every time for all your ancestors, and that's just the genetic odds, not to mention that your parents had to meet, and like each other, and not die and so on.  I think it's more beneficial to look at it the other way. The only reason you are here thinking about this, is because all of those things happened. If those things didn't happen, other things would have and someone else would be here. Or they wouldn't. Who knows.  The odds of you never existing are a moot point, because you do exist.  Another way of looking at it is that odds are really only good at describing processes which happen multiple times. Does the question "what are the odds that I met up with Bob on July 2, 2016" make sense? You might be able to calculate those odds for an average day, but for that specific point in time you know whether you did or not, so how could there be a chance that things happened differently? To me, the question is nonsense, and I think the same logic applies to other questions about the likelihood of our past.  I think it only causes anxiety if you think of yourself as an entity BEFORE you were conceived, as if all possible humans sit in a waiting room, just hoping that their number is called. That maybe comforting or terrifying depending on how you look at it, but that's a matter of religion.   permalink embed save give gold [–] chilehead  2 points 3 points 4 points  1 year ago  (0 children)  the odds that you receive exactly the combination of genes from your parents that made you is ~1 in (223 )2 or 1 in 70 trillion.

Since it's just been a thought I've had to myself for so long it's good to have an outside opinion of it, I've never really given a chance to fully explain or write it down either   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] jzpenny  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago *  (5 children)  It's infinitesimal.   Counterpoint: the universe is either actually infinite, or at least close to it from the standpoint of a grouping of elementary particles... call it 'functional infinity'.  Functional infinity just makes it really hard to calculate probabilities. In analogy and with apologies to Einstein, we have no idea how many dice were rolled, therefor we can't calculate the probability of any given result in the roll.  Actual infinity is especially weird, though. It means that the probability that an infinite number of you - exactly identical to you - on planets exactly identical to Earth, is "1". In any truly infinite system, everything that physically can occur does occur, and does so an infinite number of times. Your phone number is contained in an infinite subset of fractional numbers between 0 and 1, for example.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] grindbxp  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago  (4 children) Counter-counterpoint: the difference between actually infinite and "close to it" is immense from a philosophical standpoint. Immense might not even be strong enough a word, they describe two completely different realities.  I don't think treating the universe as actually infinite is particularly useful, because it boils down to "odds don't exist, everything that can happen, happens." It may be an interesting thing to think and talk about, but it also directly contradicts our observations. Unless you want to argue that what we observe doesn't describe reality, in which case we can just make up whatever we want and we have no way of knowing if it's true or not.  On the other hand, "functional infinity" in relation to the number of possible Earths, goes to infinity much much slower than the odds of any given person being born the way they are goes to 0. I view it similar to countable vs uncountable infinity, you can always find the next Earth+1, but if you try to even go back one generation, you will keep find smaller and smaller things that needed to go right along the way for your model to work. And that's assuming that such a thing is possible even with perfect information, which is fundamentally a belief in destiny, and that opens up a whole new can of worms.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] jzpenny  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago  (3 children)  the difference between actually infinite and "close to it" is immense from a philosophical standpoint.   Oh for sure. They're very meaningfully distinct concepts.   It may be an interesting thing to think and talk about, but it also directly contradicts our observations.   Which observations do an infinite universe contradict? As far as I know this is still considered a very open cosmological question, we really don't know and there are rationales for both.   On the other hand, "functional infinity" in relation to the number of possible Earths, goes to infinity much much slower than the odds of any given person being born the way they are goes to 0.   Wouldn't you have to know the boundaries of the system to calculate those odds?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] grindbxp  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago  (2 children) I meant our observations that macroscopic events either happen or do not happen, that the waveform collapses so to speak. Also I believe the infinite universe which is often debated by cosmologists is different from what you're describing. The universe can be infinite, but that doesn't mean it has to contain every iteration of what is possible, much the same way that the digits of Pi are infinite and non-repeating, but it doesn't have to contain every possible string of numbers (whether Pi actually does is unknown, but you can find more robust examples for the same principle). There is a good amount of evidence in favor of an infinite universe but that doesn't implicate an everything-happens universe. Actually I think there are some interpretations of quantum mechanics which say that all particles are in all places at all times... so I don't think an everything-happens universe would even need to be infinite; it could be a finite universe super-imposed.  I assume the system is unbound, as defining any boundary seems arbitrary when talking about the nature of the universe. I don't think there's anything in the laws of physics that says time has to have a start or end. But like I said in my original post, I think odds are only good for explaining events that happen many times so maybe I shouldn't be using that word at all.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] jzpenny  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago  (1 child)  I meant our observations that macroscopic events either happen or do not happen, that the waveform collapses so to speak.   I'm not following what bearing that has on whether the universe is infinite or not, though.  Consider another dimension, which physicists tend not to distinguish so much from space itself: time. Is time infinite? It certainly seems so, we can't prove it but it's the most logical conclusion. And as far as we know, time was created in and by the same event that created the other dimensions we're discussing. So why can't they be infinite?   The universe can be infinite, but that doesn't mean it has to contain every iteration of what is possible, much the same way that the digits of Pi are infinite and non-repeating, but it doesn't have to contain every possible string of numbers   The digits of pi do contain all strings of numbers. Infinity is really big. REALLY big. By definition, in an infinite system, everything that can happen does happen, and does so an infinite number of times. Infinity is wild, the best of times and the blurst of times.   There is a good amount of evidence in favor of an infinite universe but that doesn't implicate an everything-happens universe.   Why not? Lets go back to the example of all the fractional numbers between 0 and 1. Tell me, if you can, a number sequence that does not appear in an infinite number of those fractions.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] grindbxp  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago  (0 children) I see no reason for space or time to be finite, but that doesn't mean that there has to be infinite copies of yourself.  Okay, I'll use a clearer example. The number 0.010011000111... is an infinite non-repeating decimal, and pi is nowhere in that number. The fact that a number, including pi, is infinite non-repeating does not mean it contains every possible string of numbers. No mathematician who cares about their reputation would make that assertion because we have no proof for it. Infinity isn't big, infinity transcends the concept of size... I used uncountably infinite as an analogy, give me some credit here.  There are infinite non-rational numbers between 0 and 1. I like pi/4. There are different of types of infinity and they don't all contain each other.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Smithium  7 points 8 points 9 points  1 year ago  (1 child) Isn't this like the blade of grass in the golf course question from a radiolab podcast?  A blade of grass gets hit by a golf ball and cries out "why me?  What are the chances?"  while the chances of that individual blade of grass getting hit are one in a billion, the chances that some blades of grass are getting hit is 100%.  If it wasn't you asking the "why me?" question, it would be someone else who got the spot instead.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Chrisp_Hansom [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago  (0 children) That's an interesting analogy and pretty relatable I guess   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  4 points 5 points 6 points  1 year ago  (2 children) This is a fun question. I think the answer is: infinitely small and 100% guaranteed to have happened, at the same time.   permalink embed save [–] venomoushealer  1 point 2 points 3 points  1 year ago  (1 child) Three things to expand on your comment, if I may:   The probability of a randomly selected series of events forming OP is infinitely small, which you stated.  It is only 100% guaranteed to happen because it has already happened.  Prior to OP's birth... see point 1.  The probability of at least one person achieving the series of events leading to the creation of OP is still small, and probably still infinitesimally small.  But it is notably larger than the probability of Bullet 1.    permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago *  (0 children) IIRC the transition between 1 and 2 is known as quantum wave collapse in physics, and 3 is described by bayes theorem, if anyone wants more info   permalink embed save parent [–] exosequitur  3 points 4 points 5 points  1 year ago *  (0 children) The statistical probability of a unique event is not meaningful.  Statistics becomes useful for repeating events,  whether in a pattern,  randomly distributed,  or a combination of the two.  That said,  the statistical probability of your existence is approximately 1 in 1.  The statistical probability of your existence as a hypothetical coincidence is approximately 0 in 1. That's why it's not really useful to think in those terms,  the available statistical information is not really sufficient to elucidate the conditions of your existence or to reason about future events.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Alloran  2 points 3 points 4 points  1 year ago  (0 children) The answer is yes. The statistical odds of me being alive are calculable, and they are above 99.9%, given that I'm writing this right now.  What defines self? You touch on the idea of a genetic code. But you know that can't be right, because there are identical twins in the world, and they don't count as the same person.  Look up Boltzmann brains . You know there must be an infinite number of them in existence, yet they are absurdly rare, and as you go from moment to moment, do you end up a Boltzmann brain? I do not feel that I do. That's not to say there is or isn't something material to identity.  In any universe where a conscious entity arises, the conditions it observes around it are statistically very likely to be amenable to its existence.  Thus pushing the question back from the likelihood of your having sprung up to the old purview of physics—questions such as what are the fundamental constants of this iteration? And what are the mathematical properties of the universe (if any)?  We have, in centuries of studying physics, obtained a very good grasp on statistics. We can say that we are 99.9% confident that calculations we make in QCD or QED will be accurate to the fifteenth decimal place. We can make similar statements about general relativity, and all hinge on an understanding of statistics (means and standard distributions, the Gaussian (normal) distribution and its relatives).  But we cannot say what happens or why. When we try to go that far, silence is the only answer. We ask an individual quark "Where are you?" and its answer is necessarily, provably mercurial, capricious. We ask "How did you get there?" and it asks back "How much do you need to know?"  The universe begins increasingly looking like a consortium of semi-independent universes, the etiology of their works unknowable. It is only in their intersectionality that we observe means and standard deviations, which lead us to however errantly conclude that we have determined something about the nature of "the universe."   permalink embed save give gold [–] bikewithoutafish  1 point 2 points 3 points  1 year ago  (0 children) http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/courses/ncaso/Readings/Lem_Odds_NY1978.html   permalink embed save give gold [–] Imjustkidding  3 points 4 points 5 points  1 year ago  (1 child) About 50/50   permalink embed save give gold [–] jarxg  1 point 2 points 3 points  1 year ago  (0 children) /r/theydidthemath   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 — yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes!

One in 10? One in 50? One in 100? If you're over 62, your odds of having at least $1 million in net wealth (your total assets minus your total debt) are relatively achievable — about 1 in 7. But if you are under 40, your odds are low: 1 in 55. In the last 25 years, the odds that an old person is a millionaire have improved slightly. But for young people, they have gotten much worse. These figures come from a new paper by economists at the St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability, which shows evidence of a growing wealth gap that few people are talking about — the gap between the young and the old. The paper, by William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, draws on surveys of 40,000 families that the Fed carried out between 1989 and 2013 to examine the all-important role that your age plays in how much income you make and how much wealth you accumulate. It offers a few clues as to how young people can game the system and end up like their wealthy older counterparts, as well as a lot of evidence to show that things are just different for young people today. One of the most important points that the paper makes is that everyone's income and wealth tend to follow a kind of natural pattern during their life. Young people (generally defined here as those under 40) haven't been working for many years, so they don't have an opportunity to save as much; they also need to make investments in things like education and new home ownership. Middle-aged people (40-61) have been working long enough that they start to accumulate wealth rapidly. And old people (62 and up) begin to draw down on their wealth, to finance their retirement. You can see these trends in this incredible graph below, from their paper. People born in different years (1901, 1904, 1907 and so on) were surveyed at various times between 1989 and 2013 about their median family income. The chart below shows their age on the horizontal axis, and the median family income they reported making at the time on the vertical axis. The slope of each of the different colored lines shows how income was changing for that group between 1989 and 2013. For example, for the youngest generations, who appear on the left-hand side of the graph, the lines sharply slope upward because their net income is rising. World Economic Forum Here's the same graph for wealth (assets minus debt), rather than income. If you compare this with the previous chart, you can see that net worth takes a longer time to amass than income, and then declines less slowly. That's partly because a lot of people take on debt at the beginning of their lives — student debt, mortgages, etc — and thus have negative net worth. It's also because people lose their incomes as they retire, but tend to hold on to their largest sources of net worth, like their homes. World Economic Forum From bad to worse Basically, young people have always been poor. But looking beyond that basic trend, you can see that today's young people are poorer than young people of the past. The period of time in which someone is born can also have a dramatic effect on their wealth compared with other generations. The winners of this historical jackpot appear to be those who were born between 1930 and 1945 and came of age after World War II, who are sometimes called The Silent Generation. Both the Silent Generation and the generation that came before them, called The Greatest Generation because they fought in World War II, benefited from America's rapid economic growth after World War II. (As Thomas Piketty describes in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, this was not necessarily a happy story: The U.S. grew so fast after World War II because it was the only place in the world with manufacturing capacity - Europe had literally been leveled.) But The Silent Generation appears to get an additional boost because they were born during the Great Depression, a time when people had fewer babies overall. Their lower population meant that they had less competition overall for jobs, housing, investments and other opportunities. Sociologist Elwood Carlson called the generation "the lucky few" because they were smaller than the generation that came before. African-Americans and women born in those years had far more opportunity, and the generation also benefited from the expansion of the American safety net, including Social Security and Medicare, during their lives. YouTube/The Pilion Trust Charity "People born in the first half of the 20th century simply may have been in the right place at the right time as they were lifted by a rising tide," the economists write. Then came the Baby Boomers, the populous generation born after World War II. They haven't fared as well as their predecessors, in part because their greater numbers have meant more competition, and perhaps in part because the world is just a different place. The Boomers were the first generation to really experience the effects of globalization and competition from workers in the developing world. That, as well as automation and the decline of labor unions have all eroded wage growth on the lower end of the income spectrum. The charts below illustrate this difference. A sliver of the Greatest Generation, born in 1915-1917, is represented on the far right side of both graphs in teal. Part of the Silent Generation (born 1933-1935) appears in cornflower blue, while some Boomers (born 1954-1956) appear in beige. The horizontal axis shows the person's age, and the vertical axis shows their income (on the left) or median net worth (on the right). If you look at Figure 3 on the right, you can see how much better the Silent Generation did than the generations that came before or after them. Notice where the blue line overlaps with the teal line — that shows that those born between 1933 and 1935 had a much higher net worth in their 70's than those born between 1915 and 1917. In the same graph, the overlap between the blue line and the beige line shows that the Silent Generation also had a higher net worth than the Boomers did when both generations were in their mid to late 50's. World Economic Forum William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability In just 25 years, the wealth gap between young and old people has yawned wider. In 1989, old families had 7.6 times as much median wealth as young families. By 2013, it had grown to 14.7 times. According to the economists' calculations, someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than an identical person born in 1940. It's not clear exactly why this is, the economists say. The financial crisis and Great Recession certainly set young people back, but young people were doing comparatively worse even before that. And the trends are true even though America's younger generations are its most educated ever. Part of the reason could be that younger Americans are far more diverse than older generations, and race- and ethnicity-based disadvantages continue to loom large in the U.S., the economists say. White and Asian families are far wealthier than black and Hispanic families in the U.S., across all age groups. Flickr The difference may also be due to the difference in financial decisions between young and old people. Old people generally have more diverse investments, carry less debt and are more cushioned against financial shocks than younger people. If young people want to increase their chances of being wealthy, one strategy is to emulate the behavior of older people: keeping an emergency fund, paying down debt, avoiding high-cost credit, and putting money into higher-returning investments, the economists say. One strategy that might work for young people is delaying the purchase of a house. By doing so, young people can save and make a bigger down payment later, and thus lower their debt burden, as well as make more diverse investments in the interim. But even if Millennials and Gen Xers follow these strategies, the historical trends don't appear to be on their side. "Some people are just born lucky," the economists conclude.

From: Best Health Care Degrees      Your Chances of Dying  The National Center for Health Statistics reports the average life expectancy in the
United States is 77.9 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
the leading causes of death in the United States are (in descending order) heart disease,
cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, Alzheimer's disease and
diabetes. (ref: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm ) There are so many ways to die early; from risky outdoor activities to smoking.  At Best Health Degrees we decided to take a look at just how much you increase your chances of dying through these activities.  Life after all is one big series of risks.  And some risks are worth the shot. One study
shows people have a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying while attending a dance party. Another
study shows the odds of dying while skydiving in the United States is 1 in 101,083
jumps. What follows is a list of activities, from the ordinary to the extraordinary, and
your chances of dying from them. Sports and Recreational Activities  Overall, snow boarding fatality rate: 0.455 per million participant visits.

third weekend for two days for a year are: 35 days/year x 2.5 deaths/year / 37,500
climber-days/year or 1/429 (John Dill, article about death and injury in Yosemite 1970
through 1990). The mortality rates among trekkers in Nepal during two periods between 1984 and 1991:
0.014 and 0.015 per 100 trekkers. On Denali, the highest mountain in Alaska: 0.308 deaths for every 100 mountaineers who
register with the National Park Service. On Mt. Rainier: Estimated mortality rate of approximately 0.031 per 100 mountaineers. Climbing above 6000 m in the Himalayas: 10 to 12.6 deaths for every 100 mountaineers.

Women who smoke are 12 times more likely to die from the disease. Smoking triples the
risk of dying from heart disease among middle-aged men and women. People who smoke
increase their risk of death from emphysema and bronchitis by almost 10 times. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Lifelong smokers on average have a 50 percent chance of dying from tobacco-related
illnesses, with half of them dying before the age of 70. Studies show cigar smokers have
4-10 times the risk of nonsmokers of dying from laryngeal, oral, or esophageal cancers. (Source: Oral Cancer Foundation ) People who had a medium number of years lived with obesity (between five years and
14.9 years), the risk of mortality more than doubled than for people who had never
been obese. The risk of mortality almost tripled for those with the longest duration

of obesity (more than 15 years) (Source: Monash University researchers ) Miscellaneous  Dance parties: 1 in 100,000 chance of dying Table games: 1 in 100 million chance of dying Computer games: 1 in 100 million chance of dying

years from now according to British actuary Benjamin Gompertz in 1825; it's called
the "Gompertz Law of human mortality." Your probability of dying during a given year
doubles every 8 years.

This means that every single one of your ancestors also had to be conceived to become exactly who they were, so that scales the chance of you existing down to 1 in 10[2,640, 000]. When you calculate all of these possibilities and chances, the chances of you existing right now as you are (presumably with a huge headache after reading this) is basically zero .

Ali Binazir went to a Tedx talk in San Francisco and heard some probabilities being bandied about that he considered dubious:  One of the talks was by Mel Robbins , a riotously funny self-help author and life coach with a syndicated radio show.  In it, she mentioned that scientists calculate the probability of your existing as you, today, at about one in 400 trillion (4×10 14 ).  “That’s a pretty big number,” I thought to myself.  If I had 400 trillion pennies to my name, I could probably retire.  Previously, I had heard the Buddhist version of the probability of ‘this precious incarnation’.  Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere.  The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — into the middle of that life preserver. On one try.  Like a good skeptic, Binazir first calculated the turtle-head-into-life-preserver probability, making due allowances for the area of the world’s oceans and the area of the hole in a life preserver. That turns out to be 1 in 6.82×10 14 , or about 1 in 700 trillion. Pretty close to the probability-that-you-exist-figure.  But when Binazir calculated the second figure, he found out that Robbins was off. Way off. But Binazir made that calculation, too, which of course involves some ancillary assumptions and calculations. The probability that you’d exist on Earth today includes the probability that your parents would meet 20 years ago, that they’d have a relationship that would result in pregnancy, and of course that the right egg would meet the right sperm.  But it also includes the probability that your parents would also have existed with the genes they have, which means calculating that every one of your ancestors would have reproduced successfully , and that for each pair of them the right egg would have met the right sperm as well.  He comes up with this probability that you’d exist (by “you”, of course, he means those individuals resulting from the concatenation of a sperm and egg genetically to those who formed your zygote:  Probability of your existing at all: 1 in 10 2,685,000  As a comparison, the number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg, 175 lb) is 10 27 .  The number of atoms making up the earth is about 10 50 .  The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at 10 80 .  So what’s the probability of your existing?  It’s the probability of 2 million people getting together – about the population of San Diego – each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up the exact same number – say, 550,343,279,001.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible.  By that definition, I’ve just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and act like the miracle that you are.  Well, somebody’s going to point out to me that although the specific genetic “you” who exists is improbable, the probability that some you, that is, some offspring of your lineage that could be reading this piece, is much higher. Others will pick nits and question Binazir’s calculations. (Given that the number of chromosomes is limited, the probability of getting an individual nearly identical to you is higher.)  But the principle is still the same: it shows the fallacy of the anthropic principle—or of Douglas Adams’s self-reflecting puddle .  But it’s still a cool calculation nonetheless. The read probablity that you exist, of course, is 1.  Ali Binazir’s website, Smart ideas for smart living , is here .  h/t: Matthew Cobb  Share this: Tweet Like this: Like  Loading...

Orlando   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:38 am |  Permalink   It reminds me of the court cases on TV where the prosecution argues that the odds of another person having the same DNA is several billion to one and therefore not possible.  Well, by that argument, if the odds of winning a lottery are several billion to one and you win, then you must give up your winnings because the odds are so high it was impossible.  They confuse improbable with impossible and over long periods of time or with large enough numbers, the very improbable does happen.          Dr. I. Needtob Athe   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:26 am |  Permalink   It may seem like a nit-pick, but when the odds of something happening are several billion to one, that means it’s extremely likely, not unlikely. If the odds AGAINST something happening are high then that means it’s improbable.  To put it in mathematical terms, if you subtract one from the reciprocal of the probability that something will happen, you get the odds that it won’t happen.              chance   Posted November 11, 2011 at 7:58 am |  Permalink   *the REAL probability that you exist (typo in the final sentence there, you can delete this post once you fix it 😮          Julien Rousseau   Posted November 11, 2011 at 4:34 pm |  Permalink   But he must first read your post to correct the typo read for real.

Cheers,  b&          Dominic   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:04 am |  Permalink   The universe is information. This is why a god makes no sense – it would have to have more information than the universe. Am I along the right lines here?          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:10 am |  Permalink   It’s basic set theory.  The omnimax gods are indistinguishable from “the set of all sets.” I mean, that’s the whole point of such gods. Yet it was long ago demonstrated that “the set of all sets” is as meaningless a concept as “the largest (prime) number.”  The best you can do is a pantheist-style equation of “God” with Sagan’s “Cosmos.” But that just leads to confusion, so why bother?  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:10 am |  Permalink   I find this argument very strange.  What you are saying is this:  P1 Some things are in principle unknowable. P2 Omniscience, the notion of knowing everything, includes knowing things that are in principle unknowable. P3 This is incoherent. Ergo, there is no god.  The problem lies in P2.  Why does omniscience have to consist of knowing things that are in principle unknowable?  How has it come to be that you have defined omniscience to mean the set of all sets?  And what makes you think that this principle applies to a deity, which is by definition outside of the laws of the universe?  I am not a theist, nor a deist, and I think the arguments presented by religionists are wrong.  I am an atheist.  But your argument is of the same form as those sophistical paradoxes you see online sometimes: “could god create a rock so heavy even he couldn’t lift it?”  And those are not good arguments.  We could just define omniscience to mean “knowing all things that can in principle be known”.  That is not destroyed by your argument, especially if it means, for instance, knowing the absolute position and momentum of every particle in the universe from beginning to end, which a being unconstrained by the laws of the universe could ‘know’, whatever it means to know something under those conditions.  And that certainly sounds like an attribute a supposed deity would have, even if it can’t count to infinity.  It would also enable that deity to have the knowledge to make moral judgements – so your rejection of the notion of omniscience that you have come up with does no damage to the conventional notion of a deity.  You have attached a strong meaning to the word ‘omniscience’ that enables you to make the a priori judgement that it isn’t coherent.  But perhaps you need to read Quine, “Two Dogmas of Empiricism” (yes, I know – philosophy!), to understand why your argument is actually not a good one, and why your a priori rejection of any deity on the grounds of rejecting a strange supposition, wholly linguistic, of Christian theologians is not reasonable.  There are plenty of excellent arguments against all kinds of deities.  Yours is unfortunately not very good.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:25 am |  Permalink   We could just define omniscience to mean “knowing all things that can in principle be known”.  In so doing, you destroy the meaning of the word, “omnipotence.”  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers. But because it is impossible for me to know such things, and your definition of “omniscience” excludes that which it is impossible for the individual in question to know, my ignorance of tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers cannot be held against my claim of omniscience.  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know the precise number of C14 atoms in some random rock on some random planet circling some random star in the Andromeda galaxy. This ignorance, too, does not disprove my claim of omniscience (using your definition).  Continue down the line, and you quickly discover that, everything that I do not know, it is in principle impossible for me to know. I might well be able to learn it at some point in the future, but my current self cannot, in principle, know such things today.  Therefore, by your definition, I, Ben Goren, am omniscient.  Once you start making excuses for a god’s inability to perform a miracle, those same excuses must be applied to all other entities as well. And, as soon as you start handing out those get-out-of-jail-free cards to all comers, it becomes apparent that, once again, the properties attributed to the gods are meaningless.  Besides. Of what point is a miracle if it’s not an instance of the impossible? Jesus didn’t walk on water because it’s something that a space alien with repulsor sandals could do. He did it because nobody can do it. But, if he really walked on water, then it really was possible…and therefore merely impressive, not miraculous.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:36 am |  Permalink   Your point about miracles is a non-sequitur.  And you need to revise your definition of “in principle”.  You are stating that you cannot in principle know a number of things that you can, in principle, know.  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers.  Yes, you can in principle know that. In principle .  You don’t know it (and if you do, then please let me know asap).  But you could, in principle know that.  Heisenberg has some good arguments about the nature of time that rest on a notion of “in principle” that you reject.  Perhaps you should read his Physics and Philosophy to discover what “in principle” can be taken to mean.  In so doing, you destroy the meaning of the word, “omnipotence.”  No – that is only true if you assume that a deity is both omnipotent and omniscient, and while this is certainly the standard formulation, it doesn’t rule out many kinds of deity.  It just means that a deity that is omniscient is not also omnipotent, and while that has obvious implications (ie, there is no Christian god) it doesn’t rule out a deity that i) created the universe, ii) knows everything knowable, iii) makes moral judgements about actions based on knowledge of knowable things, and iv) consigns people to hell for transgressing its moral judgements.  Apart from the notion that god has the power to rain thunderbolts on your head and give you boils, you’ve left some notion of a deity reasonably intact.  And I think we already knew that omniscience, omnipotence, etc, are incompatible – hence theodicy!  That is the primary problem theologians have (apart from, you know, the utter non-existence of their subject matter).  All you’ve done is to restate this problem and say that it is not resolvable.  You may be right, but that’s not a revelation, and it’s certainly not the best argument for atheism, I’m afraid.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:50 am |  Permalink   You can try to bring all the quantum woo into it you like, but I’m sure Heisenberg, were he here, would assure you that nothing he demonstrated would make possible knowledge outside of one’s relativistic light cone. Tomorrow’s lottery numbers are most emphatically outside that cone.  But never mind that. Permit me to simplify things further.  The very principle of personal knowledge is that one can only know that which is recorded in one’s brain. The process by which such information is recorded is very well known and limited. Once one eliminates that which has not been recorded (or subsequently forgotten) along with that which has never presented the possibility for being recorded, one is left with the set of that which an individual knows being perfectly congruent with the set of that which an individual can, in principle, know. Therefore, by your definition, because there’s no way in principle that the individual could possibly know anything else, everybody is omniscient.  And your claim that it’s possible for an individual to be omniscient (using the traditional naïve definition, not your castrated version) but not omnipotent, but not vice-versa, also falls flat. An omnipotent individual could “use his omnipotence” to make himself omniscient. An omniscient individual would know how to make herself omniscient. Indeed, the two properties are indistinguishable.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:07 am |  Permalink   And your claim that it’s possible for an individual to be omniscient (using the traditional naïve definition, not your castrated version) but not omnipotent, but not vice-versa, also falls flat. An omnipotent individual could “use his omnipotence” to make himself omniscient. An omniscient individual would know how to make herself omniscient. Indeed, the two properties are indistinguishable.  First of all, I didn’t say ‘not vice versa’.  Nor did I say that an ‘individual’ could be omniscient.  Given the attenuated definition of omniscience that I discussed – one that is still undeniably the property of a ‘deity’ – it is not possible to know how to make yourself omnipotent, because that is in principle unknowable.  But even given your strong version of omniscience, it does not follow than an omniscient being would be able to make itself omnipotent.  It might actually know how, but knowledge of how to do something doesn’t equal capability to do that thing.  It could know how to make itself omnipotent without actually being able to do it.  Either way, it doesn’t hold.  If we define ‘omniscience’ as being ‘knowledge of the position and momentum of every particle in the universe from beginning to end’, which is in principle knowable (ie, it doesn’t turn into knowledge of incoherent things like the largest prime number or the set of all sets), then this is a coherent property, even if it is impossible in the universe (materially, due to recursion).  That means that you can’t reject it due to a priori speculation.  To provide an example of a deity that is not both omniscient and omnipotent, and one that was worshipped for thousands of years by the world’s most powerful empire, I give you Ahura Mazda (or, in Middle Persian, Ohrmazd), benevolent deity of the Zoroastrian religion, state religion of the Achaemenid, Arsacid, and Sasanid empires.  Hardly inconsequential!  Ahura Mazda is supposed to have created the universe; it is supposed to know everything; it is supposed to make moral judgements; but it is not supposed to be omnipotent, because it has no control over ‘evil’ things, which are the domain of Angra Manyu (MP Ahriman).  There was a religious movement in the Sasanian era to confound this – this was notably after the rise of Christianity.  An omnipotent deity was proposed, named Zurvan, who was supposed to have created both Angra Manyu and Ahura Madza.  There was a schism, of course.  There always is.  My point is, if that argument is all you have to go on (and I’m sure it’s not, but….), then you couldn’t be a Zurvanite, but you could be a Zoroastrian.          Chris V.   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:45 pm |  Permalink   Wait what? Omniscient means “all-knowing”, right? You cannot circumscribe that. The largest prime is not “unknowable”, it simply does not exist. That’s the answer that your omniscient being would give you. The same with your set-of-all-sets; it is simply recursive. It may cause problems for your garden-variety omnipotent being, but not your omniscient ones.            Occam   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:46 pm |  Permalink   “I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know the precise number of C14 atoms in some random rock on some random planet…”  Small matter of principle indeed, Ben: 14C-isotopes are only assimilated by carbon-based life forms, and therefore found only in fossilised remains thereof (or of their rejections, such as coprolites) or carbonate deposits, and only down to a detection limit of 10-15 half lives, i.e. 55-75 Ky, after which there is hardly any radiocarbon left. Hence, unless carbon-based life forms would have existed whithin that time frame on that random planet around that random star in the Andromeda galaxy, the detectable number of 14C-isotopes on a random “rock” there (organic fossil or piece of carbonate sediment, rather) would be ~zero. An omniscient being would have known that 🙂            Gabrielle Guichard   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:37 pm |  Permalink   (Outside the topic) I wonder how many believers think that what defines a deity is to be “outside of the laws of the universe”. Most think that a god cannot be defined.          David Gerard   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:42 pm |  Permalink   I’m really not convinced they think that far. “Sophisticated theology” is actually a rarity, for all its practitioners hide behind it. Most believers have a very simple theology based on God being the being with the power of magic.

I was going to make a similar comment regarding God being the “set of all sets” argument being made above.  I was raised with a lot of religious training (currently an atheist!), so I know that a common faith-based reply to these arguments would indeed be: God is outside the bounds of our limited knowledge of the rules of the universe, and is able to revise those rules if He sees fit.

The omnimax gods are indistinguishable from “the set of all sets.” […] Yet it was long ago demonstrated that “the set of all sets” is [a] meaningless […] concept….  Actually, there are set theories which do have  a “universal set” (a set of all sets, including itself), for example Quine’s New Foundations set theory.  And many set theories which lack a set of all sets do have a “proper class” of all sets, where “proper classes” are entities larger than “sets”.            Torbjorn Larsson, OM   Posted November 12, 2011 at 2:24 pm |  Permalink   The universe has access to “more information than the universe” contains in Many World Theory – quantum algorithms (QA) employ not yet fully decohered worlds to arrive at results.  Hence a QA that uses the observable universe would access more information than the universe contains.  I think Dawkins, as so many times, nailed it – design theory demands that a creator has more information than the created, and the infinite regress of creators is hence absurd twice over (infinite and infinitely demanding).

But at the same time, getting *any* specific hand is improbable too, given the number of cards and ways they can be arranged.  Its just that we find certain patterns to be ‘random’ and certain patterns to be meaningful.  The same could be considered with each human being born.

Sastra   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:14 am |  Permalink   The Fine Tuning Argument for God has always seemed to me to be one of the weakest and silliest of the arguments. Yet I’ve seen wised and learned atheists spending plenty of time on it, doing calculations and invoking multiple universes — all to get that number down so that the life-allowing properties of the universe becomes less ‘extraordinary’ and therefore more probable.  Doesn’t the whole argument fail before you even get to the calculations and odds, though? I’m not a statistician, but it may not be a matter of statistics. Mel Robbin’s talk on ‘this precious incarnation’ or whatever helps to highlight why.  Here’s the basic set-up of the FTA:  1.) Pick out something that YOU think is special and important — for any reason you want. It could be the life-allowing properties of the universe; it could be life itself; it could be you; it could be the elephant’s trunk; it could be a leaf falling on a particular spot on the sidewalk at 12:05 pm; it could be a single speck of sand on a planet in another galaxy; it could be the speck of sand to the right of that one. Whatever. Select it with reverence.  2.)Now, going back to the beginning of time (or as far as possible), think of all the things that might have happened to prevent this special, important thing from happening. Consider all the different ways things could have been, for all you know. Invoke the multiverse, if you want, as well as all the quantum events and their clouds of probability.  3.) Come up with some calculation of the odds against the special, important thing. For the sake of brevity, we could say it’s going to be something perilously close to ‘infinity to the infinity power …minus one.’  4.) Good. Gape in awe at your discovery: this special, important thing was clearly selected with reverence … by someone . WHO could that someone BE? Who might have picked out something they thought was special and important in advance of what we find after the fact?  Ummmm… can we look at step 1 and hazard a guess?  The whole damn process just seems circular to me. It wouldn’t seem to matter what was selected and what the probabilities are or how they are calculated. The results will be the same. The whole weight and purpose and import of Fine Tuning or ‘precious incarnation’ or any other process that looks at the odds and calculates a miracle is in that first step . In an elaborate and unnecessary scenario, something you select is discovered to have been something selected. A=A.  Am I missing something more critical here?          Tim Martin   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:09 pm |  Permalink   No! I said the same thing here .  “Isn’t the fine tuning argument BS to being with? It’s my understanding that even if the universe is fine-tuned to support life, we are a biased sample because we would have to be alive to think about it. Further, improbable stuff happens all the time, and we don’t even know the prior probability of getting our universe, so our universe is either not improbable, or it is but that doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen.  In other words, the multiverse hypothesis is completely unnecessary in answering the fine-tuning argument, cause it’s a shit argument.”  It’s Statistics 101 that stuff with a very low prior probability happens all the time.

Torbjorn Larsson, OM   Posted November 12, 2011 at 1:30 pm |  Permalink   The Finetuning Argument is a different beast than the Anthropic Argument though. (Which in turn differs from bona fide anthropic principles).  It can certainly be cast as the general odds-against as you did, which is an Anthropic Argument large number fallacy. But it can specifically ask about finetuning for life , which is a sensible question. (Which again differs from bona fide physics finetuning of models.)  However then there is also a sensible answer, which turns out to be bad for believers: the likelihood for any form of livable conditions is actually rather high. And in any case the weak anthropic principle, as it applies in such cases of changing parameters, would circumvent any small a priori probabilities.            Dr. I.

It’s actually a reasonable question: do I actually exist?  Certainly in ordinary language I do, and so do you, but there are very good arguments for saying that no, I don’t, and neither do you – at least, not in the same way as elementary particles exist.  Look up “mereological nihilism” on wiki, for instance, or find Trenton Merricks’ book, Objects and Persons .  It is not such a wacky idea that you do not exist, even if it seems it.  It is certainly much more reasonable than it sounds, and is not destroyed by begging the question.

Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:59 am |  Permalink   No, it is not “idiotic in the extreme”.  Is the you that exists today the same you that existed yesterday, or five minutes ago, or will exist (hopefully) in ten days time, or the same you that was birthed by your mother?  I don’t doubt that is a causal connection between all of these states, and that the stuff that made up them all actually does exist, but unless they are all exactly the same thing, you cannot say that “you” exist, because your exact properties, including causal properties, are not always the same.  You reduce to a number of parts which are not you – and so you are at most a fleeting composite.  That is not ‘existence’ in the same way that a lepton ‘exists’, and so the terms are not interchangeable salva veritate.  So we need more terms.  Either the lepton can be said to exist, or you can, but not both without considerable ambiguity or even nonsense.  Leptons exist; you… supervene?  I don’t know.  Any term will do.  But yeah, you’re right.  Dismiss it because it’s philosophy, and philosophy, as everyone knows (surely!), is just stupid.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:13 am |  Permalink   The lepton is also constantly changing — it is always in motion, it might be part of different atomic configurations, and so on.  Your concern here is an entirely theological one. Yes, theological — it’s only by presuming the existence of an immaterial soul (or its philosophical analogue, the Platonic ideal) that one can even begin to get tripped up by the gnats you’re straining at here with “Do I exist?” That your woo is labeled “philosophy” rather than “religion” doesn’t decrease the bullshit content in the slightest.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:19 am |  Permalink   Ha!  I’m not the one proclaiming so readily that ‘I’ exist as a thing irreducible to little parts.  You are.  You are saying, outright, that you exist.  That is the presupposition of someone who believes in an immaterial soul.  All I’m trying to do is make the idea of existence reasonable given what is known about the universe.  How you have managed to derive the notion that I believe in an immaterial soul from this is beyond my powers – it seems like madness.  It is the absolute direct opposite of what I have just said, which is that I probably don’t exist as an independent entity in the universe.  The lepton is also constantly changing — it is always in motion, it might be part of different atomic configurations, and so on.  Yes – but the lepton is the part , not the thing composed.  That is the difference.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:51 am |  Permalink   I’m sorry, but you’re making even less sense now.  I’ve never made any claim that the self is irreducible to little parts, and I laughed at the idiocy of souls in the post you’re replying to. And now you’re declaring that leptons are somehow not “things.”  Regrettably, every conversation I’ve ever had with a philosophy evangelist quickly deteriorates into such incomprehensible blather. How quickly it degenerates from all-knowing immaterial minds that can’t know what it’s like to forget something and all-powerful ghosts that can’t feel powerless to subatomic particles that apparently now don’t exist, either.  You’ll excuse me when I categorize all this as yet another religion, closely related to the religion of Theology, and dismiss it as an utter waste of time. Or maybe you won’t excuse me. I really don’t care.  Cheers,  b&            Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:05 pm |  Permalink   The reason you think I’m making less sense is because you’ve decide to mutilate my points and misunderstand them, seemingly on purpose.  Only that could allow for the crazy things you’ve just said.  Leptons are things – they are elementary particles, and they are irreducible (at least at present).  Their properties are constant, especially their causal properties.  Leptons exist, unambiguously and without qualification.  The same cannot be said for human beings, which have constantly changing properties made up of and reducing to a series of smaller parts with their own properties.  That is the argument that is being made.  Do you see anything in there about souls?  I don’t, and I have no idea how you managed to come up with that.  There are no souls.  There are no essences.  There are elementary particles in various quantities, arranged in certain ways, with their own properties.  Those exist.  Everything else… well, it’s somewhat more debatable.  And I’m not a ‘philosophy evangelist’.  The fact remains that you see fit to pontificate on philosophical issues while having the capability at abstract thinking, it seems, of a sponge.  Philosophy is not a religion.  It isn’t even a thing.  It’s just the name for this kind of abstract thinking.  I note, also, that you haven’t bothered to defend your claim that you unambiguously exist.  I assume that is because it would require that you outline your belief in an essence or soul, something that defines who you are without reference to properties or causal states or anything real.          DV   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:51 pm |  Permalink   “so you are at most a fleeting composite”  Do composites exist? If yes then you exist. What’s the problem?          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:08 pm |  Permalink   First of all, it’s not as simple as that.  I stated it too simply.  You are not simply one composite: you are a great series of incredibly complex composites, each different from the last in properties, from birth to death.  So even if composites, or wholes, can be held to exist, then the issue is still not settled for human beings.  If we say that “I exist” because we can accept that some wholes might exist, then we’re jumping the gun.  You could be a whole, but in a moment your component parts will be different, and so will the arrangement of those parts.  So even if composites ‘exist’, we have a number of composites rather than just one.  And to talk about all of these composites, whose causal properties might reduce to their component parts, as being the same thing – hmm, no dice.  Secondly, if we use the same word, “exist”, for both the irreducible things that make up the whole and the whole itself, then we are being ambiguous.  Third, the discussion comes down to causal properties.  An electron always has the same properties.  One electron is interchangeable in every way with another, because the causal properties of electrons are always the same.  They are little bits of the universe that do not reduce to other bits, and the properties of things made up of electrons fundamentally reduce to the properties of the electrons (or other elementary particles, etc).  If there is something with causal properties that are more than the sum of its parts, then we can talk unambiguously about that thing existing.  Some people have argued that people have causal properties that are more than the sum of their parts while accepting mereological nihilism in every other aspect.  This is called partial mereological nihilism .  Its chief proponent is Trenton Merricks, IIRC.  His book Objects and Persons outlines the idea of mereological nihilism as well as the possibility that consciousness and intention are causal properties that do not reduce to component parts – and that therefore, people can be said to exist, in a sense, albeit not one that allows for personal identity in the way we expect.  I am on the fence about that.  But regardless, it is hardly an easy topic, nor one that can be dismissed out of hand.          Filippo   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:07 pm |  Permalink   “partial mereological nihilism”  Consulting my best dictionary (but apparently inadequate, as I do not see “mereology”):  “mere” – “pure,” “unmixed”  Related to “merge”?  So is it “partial, pure nihilism”?          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:13 pm |  Permalink   Mereology – μέρος is the root.  It means “part”.  I believe Lesniewski coined the term.  It refers to the study of part/whole relations, and it’s a branch of mathematics as well as a philosophical branch.  I suggest consulting wiki – there is doubtless an article on mereology, and probably one on partial mereological nihilism.  Mereological nihilism is the view that only irreducible parts exist; anything consisting of irreducible parts with no new causal properties is not a thing, and cannot be spoken of as existing.  It is a popular view, because it seems to be the most reasonable, but it comes in a few flavours.  Partial mereological nihilism is that only a limited number of special things exist beyond their constituent parts.  This usually means: humans, or things with intentionality/consciousness/intention, etc.            Torbjorn Larsson, OM   Posted November 12, 2011 at 2:16 pm |  Permalink   and philosophy, as everyone knows (surely!), is just stupid.

Knowing that there is no essential part, no soul, no thing that is unambiguously you without reducing to something else – yes, that seems to give comfort, and has done since Epicurus pointed it out.  The best elucidation, and by far the most beautiful, of this thesis is to be found in Lucretius, De Rerum Natura .

Xenithrys   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:26 am |  Permalink   Would another approach to this estimation be to consider the probability of all my alleles being drawn together from the gene pool?  It’s a multi-dimensional Punnett square.  I’d guess it’s a bit more likely than 1 in 10^2,685,000. Factoring in the probability of all my actual ancestors isn’t necessary; I could be me—well, genetic me—with different parents so long as they both carried my alleles among theirs.          Chet   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:21 pm |  Permalink   The read probablity that you exist, of course, is 1.  Uh, no, it’s not. The probability of an outcome isn’t influenced by the fact that it already happened. There’s still (1-p) versions of you that could have existed but don’t.  The probability of rolling a “6” on a six-sided die is one in six, even if its sitting there showing a 6.          Tim Martin   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:36 pm |  Permalink   The probability of anything is based on what you already know of it.  If you ask what was the probability of a person with your genetic code coming into existence at the moment your dad ejaculated inside your mom, the answer would be 1/280 million or less, since the sperm that became you was one of 280 million in that ejaculate (and there was always the possibility that none of them would have fertilized the egg, or the embryo would not have implanted, thus 1/280 million or less ).  If you ask what was the probability of a person with your genetic code coming into existence at any time before that moment, we have to calculate the probability of that moment occurring (and the moment that led to that moment occurring, and so on), so the chances just get worse and worse the more unknowns you let into the equation.  There is no single answer to the question “what is the probability of X?” It depends on what you know about the problem. And if you know that X has already happened, then the probability of X are exactly 1, every time.          Tom Dobrzeniecki   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:32 am |  Permalink   Chet: I would disagree. To the extent that it makes sense to speak of the probability of an event that has already happened, the probability of the die being a “6” after it is rolled and has come up as “6” is one.  The probability of a another “6” coming up on SUBSEQUENT rolls is 1/6.  Those are two different things.  As Mr. Gerard wrote in comment #1, probability really deals with the state of knowledge of the observer with regard to some future event.  I already know the first roll has come up “6”.  I DON’T know how future rolls will come up, so the probability is 1/6 for those.

As nearly every cell in our bodies is replaced every three months (I am not sure about bones and teeth – do carbonate structures count as living cells?) the only continuous thing that we have is our memories, and even then they can be faulty.  Besides, I don’t have any evidence that Dr. I. Needtob Athe or anyone else here really exists, as we could all be an elaborate construction of Jerry’s Website.

It should be shunned, aside from its utility as an instructive exercise about the pitfalls of such probabilistic calculations.  What’s the probability that in a single-split experiment, a particle will hit the screen where it’s observed? Zero! Or one chance in ∞. Or, if you prefer, one chance in 10^∞. (And certainly not the a posteriori probability 1.) So what?  Really specious apologetics from sophisticated Oxonian theologians rest on awful quantifications like this. I was personally introduced via a fomer minister’s-daughter girlfriend to equivalently meaningless calculations on the probability that Jesus is God made by Josh McDowell in his books. Let’s not give any credibility to nonsensical calculations, no matter who makes them.          RFW   Posted November 12, 2011 at 5:28 am |  Permalink   It seems to me that the question is deeply flawed. At the very least “you” and “exist” are not clearly and objectively defined. And I’m not even sure that “probability” is a valid concept in the present context.  Jerry, in one of his earlier paragraphs, posits a definition of “you” that includes parentage back to the beginning of time, but from where I sit, a more reasonable definition is that “you” is distinguished by a particular combination of genes. [Note that this leaves out of the question non-genetic aspects of development, but if the definition of “you” includes “did your mother eat a lot of peanut butter during pregnancy?” then the whole issue falls to the ground in a welter of meaninglessness.]  The question, as I see it, thus becomes (a) how many genes are there in the human genome and (b) how many alleles does each gene have? IOW, how many genetically distinct humans are possible? The probability — if the concept is meaningful in this context — then becomes 1/(number of possible genetically distinct individuals).  I have no idea how many genes there are in the H. sap. genome, nor how many alleles there are for each one. Even if we just have an average number of alleles per gene, an approximation is possible. Anyone have the numbers handy?  PS: In this formulation of the question, note that “you” is not necessarily unique. In particular, identical twins are the same “you”.          sailor1031   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:57 am |  Permalink   Best not to overthink this.

But the principle is still the same: it shows the fallacy of the anthropic principle—or of Douglas Adams’s self-reflecting puddle.  Those are two different things, the a posteriori scientific anthropic principle and the a priori religious anthropic argument. The fallacy belongs to the latter, while the former is untouched by it.  I would like for scientists to acknowledge what physics have to say about this. The weak anthropic principle is the observation that if parameter varies, the likeliest spot to find observers is where the parameters are compatible with them. That is why, for example, we found life on Earth and not on the Moon.  The anthropic argument is a large number argument fallacy: large number, therefore gods. It is based on the scam that a priori probabilities has anything to say on a posteriori probabilities. Or in other word that we should find life on both Earth and the Moon.  In this context, I would think that applying WAP on an individual, let us call it the Coyne Anthropic Principle, would say that it is likeliest to find Coyne’s parents and not other couples as responsible for Coyne’s birth. Which seems like something with a likelihood on the order of ~ 1. =D  The WAP, in the form of generalized environmental principles (looking for star or dust production) is currently the most predictive theories post-standard cosmology. I refer to Boussou :  “Using the entropic principle (the assumption that entropy production traces the formation of complex structures such as observers), we derive six predictions that apply to the whole landscape.”          Josh Whalen   Posted November 26, 2012 at 3:32 am |  Permalink   I find it unlikely it is the “moment in time” that I exist, not “that” I exist.
