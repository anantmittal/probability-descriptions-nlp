[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

       it changed back from its Powerball-type game 
       to the original 6/54 format.  How to play Texas Lotto :
       To play the TX lottery game, Lotto Texas, choose 6 numbers from 1-54. Each play costs $1. 
       Drawings are held twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
       The game offers multi-million dollar jackpots, starting at 4 million.  The odds of winning Lotto Texas are one in 25,827,165 .
       These are definitely not the best winning odds of lottery games in the state of Washington.
       Compare Texas Lottery's odds to the jackpot odds of Texas Cash 5 of one in 435,897,
       the one in 1,832,600 odds of winning the Texas Two Step , or the
       odds of one in 2,704,156 of winning Texas All or Nothing .
       The only games in the state harder to win than Lotto Texas are Mega Millions , with odds of one in 302,575,350
       and Powerball with odds of one in 292 million.  Lotto Texas Extra Option :
      The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. Adding this to the ticket gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. 
      Extra doesn't change the jackpot prize, but it adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers,
      $100 to the 4 number prize, and $10,000 to the 2nd place prize for matching 5 lotto winning numbers.   How to Find Winning Lotto Numbers   Strategy Book  Below are free lottery strategies to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful tips for number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  Advantage Gold History File Note: Our Advantage Gold file for this game (tx0654.slh) 
       includes the original history as well as the new history since 2006 (but not the powerball format history). 
       However, the game range is locked to start at the April 2006 drawings.  
       If you would like to include the old history in the charts, press F3-Change Range from any chart with that option.  ADD TO CART   Lotto strategies to help you win Lotto Texas  Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. But randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Lotto Texas 6/54  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your Lotto Texas numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring only
       one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two 
       odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of 
       these three patterns will occur in 80 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       54-number game like Texas Lotto, numbers 1 to 27 would be in the low half, and numbers 28 to 54
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only two percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means 
       two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. 
       Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at the past Texas Lotto results, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-46, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose six TX lotto numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 124 and 200. 
       Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Lotto Texas 654, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the 
       last drawing 53 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Lotto numbers that have been out (losers) for five games or less account for about 
       half of the winning numbers drawn. Losing numbers that have been out 
       ten games or less account for 75 percent of all the winning numbers . This tells 
       us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at 
       least one long shot in your group of 6.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. Lotto players group: by playing the game with a group of friends, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lottery Wheels Can Beat Lotto Odds   After you choose the best numbers with number strategies, you can improve your odds of winning larger prizes by using lotto wheeling systems.
       It's simple, easy as A-B-C to wheel pick-6 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Six Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheel ® Systems allow you to 
       bet a large group of numbers (more than 6), play scientific combinations of that group 
       of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee . 
       Balanced Wheels ® force all the 
       winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one Texas Lottery prize 
       if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. To win Texas lottery, you should wheel less than about 31 of the 54 total numbers.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in the Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. You can use a FREE interactive Balanced Wheel ® System that won
       multiple jackpots. Read about our lottery winners , too. And
       when you win a jackpot with Smart Luck lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's
       growing list of winners. If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor
       that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In TX Lotto Texas 6/54,
       with two drawings a week, a set of 6 numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 220,745 years!!! This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS  Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. 
       Smart Luck has all the drawing results for more than 190 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! 
       Even five consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with 
       three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets 
       of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. TX Lotto 6/54 has 54 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers, especially in a game with this high of a number field, so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.

Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.  The reason for multiplying by 1/2 is to show the relative return based on a $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 55.98%.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.  The reason for multiplying by 1/2 is to show the relative return based on a $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 55.98%.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

Texas Lotto Tips  Updated 11/16/17   About Texas Lotto Game   Lotto Texas started as a 6/54 in July 2000, then changed to Powerball, and in April 2006,
       it changed back from its Powerball-type game 
       to the original 6/54 format.  How to play Texas Lotto :
       To play the TX lottery game, Lotto Texas, choose 6 numbers from 1-54. Each play costs $1. 
       Drawings are held twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
       The game offers multi-million dollar jackpots, starting at 4 million.  The odds of winning Lotto Texas are one in 25,827,165 .
       These are definitely not the best winning odds of lottery games in the state of Washington.
       Compare Texas Lottery's odds to the jackpot odds of Texas Cash 5 of one in 435,897,
       the one in 1,832,600 odds of winning the Texas Two Step , or the
       odds of one in 2,704,156 of winning Texas All or Nothing .
       The only games in the state harder to win than Lotto Texas are Mega Millions , with odds of one in 302,575,350
       and Powerball with odds of one in 292 million.  Lotto Texas Extra Option :
      The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. Adding this to the ticket gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. 
      Extra doesn't change the jackpot prize, but it adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers,
      $100 to the 4 number prize, and $10,000 to the 2nd place prize for matching 5 lotto winning numbers.   How to Find Winning Lotto Numbers   Strategy Book  Below are free lottery strategies to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful tips for number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  Advantage Gold History File Note: Our Advantage Gold file for this game (tx0654.slh) 
       includes the original history as well as the new history since 2006 (but not the powerball format history). 
       However, the game range is locked to start at the April 2006 drawings.

       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Lotto Texas 6/54  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your Lotto Texas numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring only
       one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two 
       odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of 
       these three patterns will occur in 80 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       54-number game like Texas Lotto, numbers 1 to 27 would be in the low half, and numbers 28 to 54
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only two percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means 
       two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. 
       Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at the past Texas Lotto results, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-46, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose six TX lotto numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 124 and 200. 
       Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Lotto Texas 654, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the 
       last drawing 53 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Lotto numbers that have been out (losers) for five games or less account for about 
       half of the winning numbers drawn. Losing numbers that have been out 
       ten games or less account for 75 percent of all the winning numbers . This tells 
       us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at 
       least one long shot in your group of 6.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. Lotto players group: by playing the game with a group of friends, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lottery Wheels Can Beat Lotto Odds   After you choose the best numbers with number strategies, you can improve your odds of winning larger prizes by using lotto wheeling systems.
       It's simple, easy as A-B-C to wheel pick-6 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Six Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheel ® Systems allow you to 
       bet a large group of numbers (more than 6), play scientific combinations of that group 
       of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee . 
       Balanced Wheels ® force all the 
       winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one Texas Lottery prize 
       if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. To win Texas lottery, you should wheel less than about 31 of the 54 total numbers.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in the Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. You can use a FREE interactive Balanced Wheel ® System that won
       multiple jackpots. Read about our lottery winners , too. And
       when you win a jackpot with Smart Luck lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's
       growing list of winners. If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor
       that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In TX Lotto Texas 6/54,
       with two drawings a week, a set of 6 numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 220,745 years!!! This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS  Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. 
       Smart Luck has all the drawing results for more than 190 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! 
       Even five consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with 
       three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets 
       of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. TX Lotto 6/54 has 54 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers, especially in a game with this high of a number field, so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.

There are two sets of balls. One set contains of 56 balls, out of which five balls are picked. The other set contains 46 balls and only one is picked out of this set. All your 5+1 numbers have to match the drawn numbers for you to win the jackpot. Here you are calculating the probability of picking all the 5 balls and the special ball correctly, i.e., P(all 5 balls ^ 1 special ball). Both these are independent on each other. So, you calculate; P(all 5 balls) x P( 1 special ball). This can be written as; (1 / 56C5) x (1/ 46), where C stands for choose. 56C5 = 56! / 51! x 5!, where ‚Äò!‚Äô stands for factorial. When you solve this, you will get the probability of winning the Texas lottery as .000000000569111, if you buy only one ticket.  Please enable JavaScript to watch this video.

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.  The reason for multiplying by 1/2 is to show the relative return based on a $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 55.98%.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.  The reason for multiplying by 1/2 is to show the relative return based on a $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 55.98%.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount.

Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.

Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.

Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).

Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

Here’s how.                  0           Eric Dexheimer  American-Statesman Staff       10:38 p.m Saturday, Feb. 11, 2017   News                      0                   Editor’s note: This article was originally published July 3, 2014               If you could enhance your odds of winning a multi-million-dollar lottery ticket by nearly 200-fold, would you do it? A Philadelphia website has just published a series of articles that, among other things, includes a detailed roadmap to a still-missing $7.5 million Texas lottery ticket. I’ve included a link to the list of stores where that ticket may be at the end of this post.   The Philly.com (a sister publication of the Philadelphia Inquirer) series focused on the fascinating and mysterious case of Joan Ginther, a native of the tiny town of Bishop, Texas, who won four multi-million dollar lottery drawings worth more than $20 million between 1993 and 2010. The odds of such luck are so astronomical as to defy belief. That, and the fact that Ginther (who later moved to Las Vegas) holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University, have led to wild speculation over to how she gamed the system.   She has never granted an interview on the topic, however, the site’s three-story series has identified the most likely explanation yet: She purchased a lot of tickets. A whole lot.   As the article states: “Basic gambling principles — like card counting in blackjack, money management in poker, and timing in progressive slots — may have inspired Joan Ginther to buy a flabbergasting number of $20 to $50 tickets, perhaps 80,000 worth $2.5 million or more.” When added to the huge number of tickets purchased by a close friend, the paper calculated Ginther could have spent upwards of $3 million on lottery tickets.   The reporter, Peter Mucha, concedes that “Massive ticket buying, whatever the level, takes the steam out of most of the mysteries.” Still, the paper’s analysis shows that Ginther still could have used the lottery’s own public information to work the odds in her favor; after all, $3 million in lottery ticket purchases only seems outrageous until you compare it to her $20 million in jackpots.       You can read more of the details here and here .   But what about the missing $7.5 million ticket? Mucha used serial numbers on the books of $50 scratch-off tickets and the lottery’s own description of how winning tickets are placed to narrow down where the remaining jackpot winner may still reside. As the article explains: “A $50 scratch-off game called $7,500,000 Fortune started out with three top prizes among about 190,000 packs of tickets. Our list of likely suspects for the last big prize is much, much shorter — just 332 packs, all from the early part of the game — and includes not only pack numbers but the retailers last known to have those packs.”   The full list of stores includes a dozen Austin outlets.

The more you  play the more will be chances of you winning  the game. It goes with the tickets. Try to buy  more tickets because they are your weapon to  win the jackpot. The more tickets you have  the better it will be.

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

       it changed back from its Powerball-type game 
       to the original 6/54 format.  How to play Texas Lotto :
       To play the TX lottery game, Lotto Texas, choose 6 numbers from 1-54. Each play costs $1. 
       Drawings are held twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
       The game offers multi-million dollar jackpots, starting at 4 million.  The odds of winning Lotto Texas are one in 25,827,165 .
       These are definitely not the best winning odds of lottery games in the state of Washington.
       Compare Texas Lottery's odds to the jackpot odds of Texas Cash 5 of one in 435,897,
       the one in 1,832,600 odds of winning the Texas Two Step , or the
       odds of one in 2,704,156 of winning Texas All or Nothing .
       The only games in the state harder to win than Lotto Texas are Mega Millions , with odds of one in 302,575,350
       and Powerball with odds of one in 292 million.  Lotto Texas Extra Option :
      The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. Adding this to the ticket gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. 
      Extra doesn't change the jackpot prize, but it adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers,
      $100 to the 4 number prize, and $10,000 to the 2nd place prize for matching 5 lotto winning numbers.   How to Find Winning Lotto Numbers   Strategy Book  Below are free lottery strategies to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful tips for number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  Advantage Gold History File Note: Our Advantage Gold file for this game (tx0654.slh) 
       includes the original history as well as the new history since 2006 (but not the powerball format history). 
       However, the game range is locked to start at the April 2006 drawings.  
       If you would like to include the old history in the charts, press F3-Change Range from any chart with that option.  ADD TO CART   Lotto strategies to help you win Lotto Texas  Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. But randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Lotto Texas 6/54  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your Lotto Texas numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring only
       one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two 
       odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of 
       these three patterns will occur in 80 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       54-number game like Texas Lotto, numbers 1 to 27 would be in the low half, and numbers 28 to 54
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only two percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means 
       two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. 
       Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at the past Texas Lotto results, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-46, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose six TX lotto numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 124 and 200. 
       Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Lotto Texas 654, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the 
       last drawing 53 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Lotto numbers that have been out (losers) for five games or less account for about 
       half of the winning numbers drawn. Losing numbers that have been out 
       ten games or less account for 75 percent of all the winning numbers . This tells 
       us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at 
       least one long shot in your group of 6.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. Lotto players group: by playing the game with a group of friends, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lottery Wheels Can Beat Lotto Odds   After you choose the best numbers with number strategies, you can improve your odds of winning larger prizes by using lotto wheeling systems.
       It's simple, easy as A-B-C to wheel pick-6 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Six Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheel ® Systems allow you to 
       bet a large group of numbers (more than 6), play scientific combinations of that group 
       of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee . 
       Balanced Wheels ® force all the 
       winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one Texas Lottery prize 
       if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. To win Texas lottery, you should wheel less than about 31 of the 54 total numbers.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in the Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. You can use a FREE interactive Balanced Wheel ® System that won
       multiple jackpots. Read about our lottery winners , too. And
       when you win a jackpot with Smart Luck lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's
       growing list of winners. If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor
       that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In TX Lotto Texas 6/54,
       with two drawings a week, a set of 6 numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 220,745 years!!! This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS  Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. 
       Smart Luck has all the drawing results for more than 190 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! 
       Even five consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with 
       three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets 
       of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. TX Lotto 6/54 has 54 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers, especially in a game with this high of a number field, so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.
       Advantage Gold is the best lotto strategy software which has a vast assortment of charts and reports
       that allow you to examine your lotto numbers in an infinite variety of ways.

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.

There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.  The reason for multiplying by 1/2 is to show the relative return based on a $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 55.98%.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

Texas Lotto Tips  Updated 11/16/17   About Texas Lotto Game   Lotto Texas started as a 6/54 in July 2000, then changed to Powerball, and in April 2006,
       it changed back from its Powerball-type game 
       to the original 6/54 format.  How to play Texas Lotto :
       To play the TX lottery game, Lotto Texas, choose 6 numbers from 1-54. Each play costs $1. 
       Drawings are held twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
       The game offers multi-million dollar jackpots, starting at 4 million.  The odds of winning Lotto Texas are one in 25,827,165 .
       These are definitely not the best winning odds of lottery games in the state of Washington.
       Compare Texas Lottery's odds to the jackpot odds of Texas Cash 5 of one in 435,897,
       the one in 1,832,600 odds of winning the Texas Two Step , or the
       odds of one in 2,704,156 of winning Texas All or Nothing .
       The only games in the state harder to win than Lotto Texas are Mega Millions , with odds of one in 302,575,350
       and Powerball with odds of one in 292 million.  Lotto Texas Extra Option :
      The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. Adding this to the ticket gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. 
      Extra doesn't change the jackpot prize, but it adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers,
      $100 to the 4 number prize, and $10,000 to the 2nd place prize for matching 5 lotto winning numbers.   How to Find Winning Lotto Numbers   Strategy Book  Below are free lottery strategies to help you play the game smarter and win the lottery, taken from Gail Howard's lotto book, Lottery Master Guide . This is just a sample, and the book
       explains all of Smart Luck's successful tips for number selection in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. It is a great starting place for any lotto player.  ADD TO CART    Strategy Software  Advantage Gold software makes all the charts for this game, to automate the process of choosing the best numbers to play.  Advantage Gold History File Note: Our Advantage Gold file for this game (tx0654.slh) 
       includes the original history as well as the new history since 2006 (but not the powerball format history). 
       However, the game range is locked to start at the April 2006 drawings.  
       If you would like to include the old history in the charts, press F3-Change Range from any chart with that option.  ADD TO CART   Lotto strategies to help you win Lotto Texas  Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. But randomly drawn numbers form patterns
       that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the 
       drawings in past lotto results of more than 200 different lotto games worldwide, with
       histories going back as far as 1955, we have verified the following incredibly
       simple rule:  That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN. That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.   The key to Smart Luck's successful lotto number selection methods is playing
       the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five
       percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95
       percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of
       the time. So, don't buck the probabilities.  How to WIN Lotto Texas 6/54  ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  When you select your Lotto Texas numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and
       even numbers. All odd numbers or all even numbers are rarely drawn, occurring only
       one percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two 
       odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of 
       these three patterns will occur in 80 percent of the drawings.  HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS  Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire number field . If we take a
       number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a
       54-number game like Texas Lotto, numbers 1 to 27 would be in the low half, and numbers 28 to 54
       would be in the high half. All high numbers or all low numbers are rarely drawn, occurring
       only two percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means 
       two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. 
       Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings.  LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES  Look at the past Texas Lotto results, and you'll see,
       more often than not, that one or more of the number groups is not represented. For
       example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-46, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying
       Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra
       heavy play.  LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES  List the number of games skipped (games out) since the last hit (win) for each of
       the winning numbers during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each
       skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that
       are out that many games. ( Help working with lotto games skipped .)  LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME ®  After you choose six TX lotto numbers you want to play, add them together and make sure
       that the sum of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 124 and 200. 
       Sums that
       fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all lottery jackpots won.  REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS  In Lotto Texas 654, on average, one lottery number will be a repeat hit from the 
       last drawing 53 percent of the time.  HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  Lotto numbers that have been out (losers) for five games or less account for about 
       half of the winning numbers drawn. Losing numbers that have been out 
       ten games or less account for 75 percent of all the winning numbers . This tells 
       us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at 
       least one long shot in your group of 6.  COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS  It is difficult to know when a cold number will end a long losing streak. If you play a
       number every drawing because you think it is due , you could be chasing it
       for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it
       finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be
       worth chasing.  Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates  POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES  Several of the 107 Lotto jackpots won with Smart Luck lottery systems were won by groups of people
       who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto
       budget. Lotto players group: by playing the game with a group of friends, you can afford to buy more lottery
       tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by
       yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it.  How to Get Lucky in Lotto  CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS  When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A
       jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool.
       Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid
       negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain
       energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One
       quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you
       are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win
       anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either.  CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the
       winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble
       with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the
       winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by
       emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal
       that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when
       every effort is made to attain that goal.  Lottery Wheels Can Beat Lotto Odds   After you choose the best numbers with number strategies, you can improve your odds of winning larger prizes by using lotto wheeling systems.
       It's simple, easy as A-B-C to wheel pick-6 lotto numbers using the 
       Balanced Wheels in the Wheel Six Gold lottery software .
       You get a minimum win guarantee with every wheel!  ADD TO CART   Lottery Wheels  USE BALANCED WHEEL ® SYSTEMS  Balanced Wheel ® Systems allow you to 
       bet a large group of numbers (more than 6), play scientific combinations of that group 
       of numbers, and get a specific minimum win guarantee . 
       Balanced Wheels ® force all the 
       winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one Texas Lottery prize 
       if some or all of the winning numbers are in your chosen group.  It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning
       numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum
       number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers
       in your game. To win Texas lottery, you should wheel less than about 31 of the 54 total numbers.
       Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. 
       You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers.  THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME  Any one wheeling
       system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win
       guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in
       the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages
       137 to 142 in the Lottery Master Guide.   Most of Smart Luck's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel ® in addition to her Smart Luck ® number selection methods. You can use a FREE interactive Balanced Wheel ® System that won
       multiple jackpots. Read about our lottery winners , too. And
       when you win a jackpot with Smart Luck lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's
       growing list of winners. If you don't want your name publicized, we will honor
       that.  Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid  Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. 
       By knowing which number combinations and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too.  AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE  Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and
       by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In TX Lotto Texas 6/54,
       with two drawings a week, a set of 6 numbers has a chance of being drawn once
       every 220,745 years!!! This should also answer the question we are so often asked,
       "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due
       to hit sometime?"  AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS  Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. 
       Smart Luck has all the drawing results for more than 190 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! 
       Even five consecutive numbers is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once.  AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP  Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or
       all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is
       highly unlikely.  AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6  The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of
       tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection
       is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing.  AVOID PATTERN BETTING  Pattern betting is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of
       numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip
       vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with
       others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of
       initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play.  AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES  Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially
       5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42.  AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS  Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that
       end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur
       in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with 
       three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets 
       of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all
       drawings.  AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS  The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth
       dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most
       heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. TX Lotto 6/54 has 54 numbers. If you play
       only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other
       winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But we recommend that you include a couple of high
       numbers, especially in a game with this high of a number field, so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth
       something.  NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS  Quick Picks are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting
       any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears
       as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages.
       The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are
       Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won
       with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as we did, you'll find that you have
       a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using
       Quick Picks.  In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend  The shortest, easiest way to search for Lotto numbers that have
       the greatest probability of winning is to track the trends. Smart Luck strategies show you how to understand and use historical data.
       Advantage Gold is the best lotto strategy software which has a vast assortment of charts and reports
       that allow you to examine your lotto numbers in an infinite variety of ways.

There are two sets of balls. One set contains of 56 balls, out of which five balls are picked. The other set contains 46 balls and only one is picked out of this set. All your 5+1 numbers have to match the drawn numbers for you to win the jackpot. Here you are calculating the probability of picking all the 5 balls and the special ball correctly, i.e., P(all 5 balls ^ 1 special ball). Both these are independent on each other. So, you calculate; P(all 5 balls) x P( 1 special ball). This can be written as; (1 / 56C5) x (1/ 46), where C stands for choose. 56C5 = 56! / 51! x 5!, where ‚Äò!‚Äô stands for factorial.

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.   Pick 3 — Sum it Up     Bets  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   0 or 27 500 1 0.001 0.500  1 or 26 166 3 0.003 0.498  2 or 25 83 6 0.006 0.498  3 or 24 50 10 0.010 0.500  4 or 23 33 15 0.015 0.495  5 or 22 23 21 0.021 0.483  6 or 21 17 28 0.028 0.476  7 or 20 13 36 0.036 0.468  8 or 19 11 45 0.045 0.495  9 or 18 9 55 0.055 0.495  10 or 17 7 63 0.063 0.441  11 or 16 7 69 0.069 0.483  12 or 15 6 73 0.073 0.438  13 or 14 6 75 0.075 0.450     Daily 4   The Daily 4 is played every day except Sunday. The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

When that occurs, the 40.15% sub-share for catching 5 is rolled down into the share for catching 4. The following table shows the average prize for each win, assuming that nobody matched all five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.  The reason for multiplying by 1/2 is to show the relative return based on a $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 55.98%.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

The percentage of ticket sales paid back as prizes is 63.1%.  Of the rest, 27% goes towards education, 9.5% towards expenses, and 0.4% in unclaimed wins goes mostly towards Veterans ( source ).  Not every game pays back 63.1%.  In fact, the return ranges from a low of 44% to a high of 78%, so choose your game carefully.  The Texas Lottery has an unusual rule that players of games where the grand prize is in the form of an annuity must choose whether to accept the annuity or a lump sum payment at the time of purchase. Why they bother everybody with this question, I have no idea.  The rest of this page contains my analysis of the several ways to play the Texas Lottery.  However, for those who just want the executive summary, here is the overall return of each game:   Pick 3:	48% to 50% Daily 4:	44.3% to 50% Cash 5:	50% Lotto Texas:	50% to 51.8% Texas Two Step:	50% Triple Chance:	54.40% All or Nothing:	56.00% Powerball:	50% Mega Millions:	50% Scratch Cards:	60% to 77.8%  Next, here is my quick advice on how to play each game where there is some decision to be made other than picking numbers:   Pick 3:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on a total of 0, 3, 24, or 27. Daily 4:  Play straight "exact order" bets, as opposed to box "any order" bets, or on totals of 3 or less or 33 or more. Lotto Texas:	Invoke the Extra option, which carries a higher return than the base game. Scratch Cards:	 The return is greater as you go up in price.  Do not play games with a trademarked name.  Finally, here is my general advice for playing any lottery game:   Don't play in the first place.  Every state lottery offers terrible odds.  With few exceptions, it is the worst bet you can make.  For any game involving choosing numbers, I suggest the Quick Pick option.  Players that pick their own numbers are at greater risk to get short changed on a jackpot by having to share it with many other players who picked the same numbers for the same reasons you did.   What follows is my analysis of each game.  Pick 3   The Pick 3 is played four times a day (except Sunday). The player and Lottery each pick three numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There is also a "Sum it Up" bet, based on the total of the Lottery's three numbers.  The player can choose to play "exact order" or "any order."  It is harder to win if the numbers must match in order, but you stand to win more.  The probability of winning, and the win, playing "any order" depend on the whether the player chooses three different numbers (such as 1-2-3) or a pair of the same number (for example 1-1-2).  The following table shows the win, probability of winning, and return for all three ways to play.  The right column shows the expected return is 50% playing "exact order" and 48% playing "any order."   Pick 3 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Exact order 500 1 0.001 0.500  Any order (1-2-3) 80 6 0.006 0.480  Any order (1-1-2) 160 3 0.003 0.480     The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet.  The average total is 13.5, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.  The right column shows the maximum return is 50% on totals of 0, 3, 24, and 27.

The player and lottery each pick four numbers from 0 to 9, with replacement. Bets can be $0.50, $1, or $5. There are also bets for matching two specific numbers and the sum of all four numbers.  The following table shows the probability of winning each prize, the average win, and return for each way to play.  There is a separate line for each way to play a box bet, according to how the numbers may repeat.  The numbers in parenthesis are just an example.  For example, 1-1-2-2 would be any two pairs of numbers.   Daily 4 Return Table     Bet  Pays  Combinations  Probability  Return   Straight 5000 1 0.0001 0.50  Box (1-1-1-2) 1200 4 0.0004 0.48  Box (1-1-2-2) 800 6 0.0006 0.48  Box (1-1-2-3) 400 12 0.0012 0.48  Box (1-2-3-4) 200 24 0.0024 0.48     As you can see from the return column, the best bet is a straight bet, where the number must match in order, at a return of 50%.  There are three Pair bets (Front Pair, Middle Pair, Back Pair), which are bets on matching just two specific numbers. They pay $50, have a 1% chance of winning, and offer a return of 50%.  The next table summarizes the Sum it Up bet for the Daily 4.  The average total is 18, so the further you bet from that, the more you will get paid if you win.

Cash 5   Cash 5 is a simple $1 daily game where the player and lottery each pick 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 37.  Wins are for matching 2 to 5.  The percentage of ticket sales returned to winning players is a minimum of 50% (source: Texas Regulation 16.9.401.D(2) ).  The top three awards are awarded a sub-share of the 50% share returned to players.  Wins for matching 2 are always $2.  The following table shows the sub-share awarded to each win.   Match 5:  40.15%  Match 4:  18.08%  Match 3:  41.77%  Match 2:  $2   The following table shows the average prizes under these rules, assuming there is at least one win for catching five.

Lotto Texas   Lotto Texas is a $1 game where the player and Lottery each pick six numbers from 1 to 54.  There is also an "extra" bet the player can make that bumps up the smaller wins.  Draws are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  If the player wins the jackpot, it will be paid as a 30-year fixed annuity, unless the lump sum option is taken.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.305) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 6:  40.47%  Catch 5:  2.23%  Catch 4:  3.28%  Catch 3:  Fixed prize of $3   The following table shows the probability of winning, average prize, and contribution to the return for all possible outcomes, assuming there was at least one jackpot winner.

In the event nobody wins the jackpot, the 40.47% of ticket sales will trickle down to pay winners who catch 5.  The average win for catching five when there are no jackpot winners will be  $38,292.36.  The next table shows the pay table, probability of winning, and contribution to the return for the Extra option.  The player may not bet the Extra option by itself but it is an optional bet if the player is already playing the base game.

The bottom line is the return is 50.00% on the base game and 53.70% on the Extra bet.  That said, my advice is that if you must play, your overall return will be higher if you make the Extra bet.  Texas Two Step   The Texas Two Step is a $1 game with a draw every Monday and Thursday.  The object is to match the draw of four White Balls from a range of 1 to 35 and one Bonus Ball from a separate pool of 35 balls.  The player can win by matching the Bonus Ball or at least three of the White Balls.  According to the Texas Lottery Commission (Title 16.9.401.D.rule 401.302) , the portion of ticket sales directed towards prizes are directed as follows:   Catch 4 with Bonus Ball:  23.78%  Catch 4 without Bonus Ball:  2.79%  Catch 3 with Bonus Ball:  0.34%  Catch 3 without Bonus Ball:  4.6%  Catch 2 with Bonus Ball:  3.04%  Catch 1 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $7  Catch 0 with Bonus Ball:  Fixed prize of $5   In the event nobody wins the jackpot, then the money will roll over to the next drawing.  The jackpot reset amount is $200,000.  The following table shows the average win for each prize, the probability, and contribution to the total return.

Texas Triple Chance   Texas Triple Chance is a game based on a draw of 10 numbers out of 55.  While the Lottery will draw ten numbers, the player picks seven only.  For a $2 bet the player gets three plays.  There is one draw per day, at 10:12 PM, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins if he matches 3 or more numbers.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 3/2.  The reason for multiplying by 3/2 is the player gets three tickets for each $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 54.42%.

The probability of at least one win over three games is 28.08%, assuming independently drawn numbers.  All or Nothing   All or Nothing is a misnomer of game. The player does indeed win the most by hitting all or none of his numbers, but there are also consolation prizes for getting close to either extreme. The way it works is the player will pick 12 numbers from a range of 1 to 24. The Lottery will randomly do the same. A ticket costs $2. The Lottery will have a draw four times a day, except Sundays.  The table below shows how much the player wins for matching 0-4 or 9-12.  The return column is the product of the win, probability, and 1/2.  The reason for multiplying by 1/2 is to show the relative return based on a $2 bet.  The bottom right cell shows a rate of return of 55.98%.

Multi-State Games   Texas participates in part of both multi-state lotteries, the Powerball and Mega Millions.  According to Lottery regulations, approximately 50% of money bet is returned to winning players  (Source: Texas Powerball Regulations and Texas Mega Millions Regulations ).  Please see my Powerball page for more information on that game.  A Mega Millions page is coming soon.  Scratchers   Scratch card games are simple games on a card. The player scratches to reveal his prize. At the time of this writing, scratch cards were available at costs of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $50.  The Lottery doesn't implicitly state the percentage of money returned to the player.  However, they kindly indicate the number of tickets printed and the number of each win, so it is easy to deduce the number of losers.  With that, it is easy to calculate the return percentage.  Let's look at the Spicy 9's $1 game, as an example.  They tell us everything we need to know, except the numbers of losing tickets.  They tell us there are  11,104,650 tickets in the game.  The sum of winning tickets is  2,372,575, which must mean there are  8,732,075 losers.  We can now set up a return table for the game, as follows:   Lucky 9's     Win  Tickets  Probability  Return   $1,000 113 0.000010 0.010176  $500 251 0.000023 0.011302  $100 1,549 0.000139 0.013949  $50 1,866 0.000168 0.008402  $20 49,461 0.004454 0.089082  $10 135,589 0.012210 0.122101  $5 135,602 0.012211 0.061056  $3 258,972 0.023321 0.069963  $2 592,353 0.053343 0.106686  $1 1,196,819 0.107776 0.107776  Loser 8,732,075 0.786344 0.000000  Total 11,104,650 1.000000 0.600493     The lower right cell shows a return of 60.05%.  The probability of any win is 100% - 78.63% = 21.37%.  However, not all games have the same return. As a rule of thumb, for any given denomination, returns are in a tight range. As you pay more for a ticket, the return percentage goes up. Here is the average return of some games I sampled, by denomination, not counting trademarked games:   Texas Scratch Card Average Returns*     Bet  Average Return   $1 60.12%  $2 65.01%  $3 65.93%  $5 68.01%  $10 71.00%  $20 74.97%  $50 77.81%     *:  Does not include games with a Trademarked name.  You may be wondering at this point, what do I have against including Trademarked games?  A lot.  I find they depress the return by up to 8%!  In all fairness, many of the Trademarked games offer non-cash prizes in a second chance drawing you must enter online to win.  As an example, the Houston Astros game has a return of 64.56%, which is 3.45% less than the average for a $5 ticket of active non-trademarked games at the time of this writing.  However, the player can win a trip to the World Series or other "Merchandise Prize Packs" in the second-chance drawing.  These second chance drawings seem to only happen for trademarked games and not all of them.  Next, I would like to mention that Texas is nice enough to have a vague policy of retiring games early if all the big winners are claimed.  Here is how the Texas Lottery words it:  "Game closing procedures may be initiated for documented business reasons. These games may have prizes unclaimed, including top prizes. Game closing procedures will be initiated when all top prizes have been claimed. During closing, games may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed."  If we assume that the instant all of the biggest prizes are sold the Lottery will immediately stop selling tickets (a big "if"), then that increases the return by the ratio of the jackpot amount and the total number of tickets. For example, in the Lucky 9's game above, the return would go up by $1,000/11,104,650 = 0.009%.  However, this is a big "if" because:   The rules say the Lottery "may" initiate closing procedures, which implies it also may not.  Tickets may be sold anyway during closing procedures.  I have no idea how long that phase lasts.  Jackpot winners may delay cashing their tickets, which may give the illusion that there are winning tickets left unsold, when there are not.   However, if we assume a best case scenario that the Lottery always does closes a game immediately when there are no jackpot winners left, then I find it increases the return by up to 4.09%, with an average of 0.62%.  The benefit tends to be more for the more expensive tickets, which have fewer jackpots.  In general the value of this rule is more for games where the ratio of jackpot tickets is small.  Finally, I'm sure some people will not appreciate my mentioning this, but there is a potential advantage play in scratch card games.  The Texas Lottery is nice enough to indicate how many tickets for each win have already been cashed.  If there is a game that is almost sold out, as evidenced by the small wins, with a high ratio of large wins still unclaimed, then it may mean the remaining unsold tickets are rich in big winners.  The same principle as card counting in blackjack.  I'll leave the details to the reader (don't you hate it when I say that?).

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

[2]  The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo – designs from a contracted ad agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo – a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) – was the public design (the winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton ). [3]  The Lottery's first game was the scratch-off ticket Lone Star Millions , with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill . First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets set a then-world record, with first-week sales (ending June 5, 1992) also setting a world record. [3]  Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14, 1992 and the first jackpot (from Schulenburg) won on November 28, 1992. [3] By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking the Florida Lottery 's record set in 1989. [4]  The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ). [4]  Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas was two days later. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. [5] The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize.  As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball , the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later.  On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would potentially bring an end to the lottery in Texas. [6] Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. [7]  General rules [ edit ]  As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age.  Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. [13] [14]    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [15]    3 of 6 numbers  $ 3 (guaranteed)  1:75    4 of 6 numbers  $ 50 (estimated)  1:1,526    5 of 6 numbers  $ 2,000 (estimated)  1:89,678    All 6 numbers  Jackpot  1:25,827,165    Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch-off tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing.  Within Texas, players must choose when playing (instead of after winning) the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets (see below.)  According to the Texas Lottery Commission, the allocation of lottery sales (since 1997) is as follows: [8]   62.5 percent is paid out in prizes  Approximately 27.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is used to support public education in Texas  5.4 percent is paid as retailer commissions  4.2 percent is retained to cover Lottery Administration costs  Approximately 0.4 percent (specifically, the value of unclaimed prizes) is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation; since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans and other state programs.   Current Texas Lottery games [ edit ]  Scratch-off tickets [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions . By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), [3] There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. [9]  Instant tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only US lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets.  Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium .  In-house drawings [ edit ]  Lotto Texas [ edit ]  Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. [4]  Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the "Quick Pick" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), [4] the "Cash Value" option (CVO), [10] and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays.  Among notable winners was Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson , the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. [11]  The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $4 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. [12] The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount.

Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. [16]  Texas Two Step [ edit ]  Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. [17]  The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball , from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [18]    Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 5 (guaranteed)  1:58    1 number, plus Bonus Ball  $ 7 (guaranteed)  1:102    2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:657    3 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 20 (estimated)  1:435    3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  $ 50  1:14,779    4 numbers, no Bonus Ball  $ 1,501  1:53,900    All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball  Jackpot  1:1,832,600    Overall odds of winning are 1:32.  Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.)  All or Nothing [ edit ]  The Texas Lottery's newest draw game, All or Nothing , is drawn 24 times weekly; 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if all 12 numbers match those drawn, or, if none match the numbers drawn . (The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize.) Other prizes are: $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers, or, no more than four. Games are $2 each.  Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for " quick pick " and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. [19]  Cash Five [ edit ]  Cash Five is a daily-draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5 ) began on July 29, 2002. [20]  The current format utilizes one set of 37 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.    Matches  Prize  Current probability of winning [21]    2 of 5 numbers  $ 2 (guaranteed)  1:9    3 of 5 numbers  $ 11 (estimated)  1:88    4 of 5 numbers  $ 123 (estimated if not Top Prize) / $395 (estimated if Top Prize)  1:2,724    All 5 numbers  Top Prize  1:435,897    Overall odds of winning are 1:8.  Pick 3 [ edit ]  Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. [4]  The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9. Players choose: exact order (all three digits), any order (two or three digits), exact and any order (two or three digits), combo (two or three digits; combo two is the same as two exact order plays while combo three is the same as three or six exact order plays) and Sum It Up (the arithmetic sum of the numbers played is the same as the arithmetic sum of the numbers drawn; the numbers drawn do not have to be the same as the numbers played).  All payments are in lump sum. Exact or any order bets cost $0.50 or $1; exact and any order for $1, combo (two digits cost $1.50 or $3; three digits cost $3 or $6), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held four times a day, at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Daily 4 [ edit ]  Daily 4 also is drawn 24 times weekly. Sales began on September 30, 2007. [22]  Daily 4 is played as in Pick 3, except there are 4 digits. Players can select: Straight (all four digits in exact order), Box (all four digits in any order), Straight/Box (all four digits), Pairs [two of the four digits in exact order, which can be: front pair (first two digits), middle pair (middle digits), or back pair (last two digits)], Combo [which can be: 4-way (three of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1112), 6-way (the digits drawn are two pairs, such as 1122), 12-way (two of the four digits drawn are identical, such as 1123), or 24-way (all four digits are different, such as 1234)] and "Sum It Up" (see Pick 3.)  All payments are in lump sum. Players can select Straight or Box for either $0.50 or $1; Straight/Box for $1; Pairs for $0.50 or $1; Combo (4-way for $2 or $4; 6-way for $3 or $6; 12-way for $6 or $12; or 24-way for $12 or $24), and Sum It Up for an additional $0.50. The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays.  Texas Triple Chance [ edit ]  Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance is a $2 game. You select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, you get two extra sets, both quick picks. 10 numbers are drawn, To win, you must match by a horizontal set.  3 = $2 4 = $5 5 = $25 6 = $500 7 = up to $100,000  Game's played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time.  Multi-jurisdictional drawings [ edit ]  Mega Millions [ edit ]  In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium.  The current format utilizes one set of 75 white balls, and a second set, of 15 yellow balls (the "Mega Ball".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the "Mega Ball" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays.  Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California , offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play ) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen.  Powerball [ edit ]  On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball , the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010.  The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball.  On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. [23]  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (suspended) [ edit ]  Main article: Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board.  Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing.  Timing of player's jackpot choice [ edit ]  Unusually, Texas Lottery regulations require players to choose either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and/or Powerball. Other lotteries generally allow players to make the cash/annuity choice after winning (including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes.) The choice when playing in Texas is binding. All three games mentioned above (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had "AP" as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip was not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow CVO to be chosen after winning Powerball.  Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes.  Texas is expected to be part of the launch of Monopoly Millionaires' Club in October 2014. Jackpots will be annuitized with a cash option; a Texas player who does not mark either choice automatically will receive a ticket marked CVO.  Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

Here’s how.                  0           Eric Dexheimer  American-Statesman Staff       10:38 p.m Saturday, Feb. 11, 2017   News                      0                   Editor’s note: This article was originally published July 3, 2014               If you could enhance your odds of winning a multi-million-dollar lottery ticket by nearly 200-fold, would you do it? A Philadelphia website has just published a series of articles that, among other things, includes a detailed roadmap to a still-missing $7.5 million Texas lottery ticket. I’ve included a link to the list of stores where that ticket may be at the end of this post.   The Philly.com (a sister publication of the Philadelphia Inquirer) series focused on the fascinating and mysterious case of Joan Ginther, a native of the tiny town of Bishop, Texas, who won four multi-million dollar lottery drawings worth more than $20 million between 1993 and 2010. The odds of such luck are so astronomical as to defy belief. That, and the fact that Ginther (who later moved to Las Vegas) holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University, have led to wild speculation over to how she gamed the system.   She has never granted an interview on the topic, however, the site’s three-story series has identified the most likely explanation yet: She purchased a lot of tickets. A whole lot.   As the article states: “Basic gambling principles — like card counting in blackjack, money management in poker, and timing in progressive slots — may have inspired Joan Ginther to buy a flabbergasting number of $20 to $50 tickets, perhaps 80,000 worth $2.5 million or more.” When added to the huge number of tickets purchased by a close friend, the paper calculated Ginther could have spent upwards of $3 million on lottery tickets.   The reporter, Peter Mucha, concedes that “Massive ticket buying, whatever the level, takes the steam out of most of the mysteries.” Still, the paper’s analysis shows that Ginther still could have used the lottery’s own public information to work the odds in her favor; after all, $3 million in lottery ticket purchases only seems outrageous until you compare it to her $20 million in jackpots.       You can read more of the details here and here .   But what about the missing $7.5 million ticket? Mucha used serial numbers on the books of $50 scratch-off tickets and the lottery’s own description of how winning tickets are placed to narrow down where the remaining jackpot winner may still reside. As the article explains: “A $50 scratch-off game called $7,500,000 Fortune started out with three top prizes among about 190,000 packs of tickets. Our list of likely suspects for the last big prize is much, much shorter — just 332 packs, all from the early part of the game — and includes not only pack numbers but the retailers last known to have those packs.”   The full list of stores includes a dozen Austin outlets. Happy hunting.

    Winning Tips for the Texas Lottery!• How to win the lottery? This is a serious question because not everybody  wins the lottery every time. Lottery or lotto both in a way are the game of  luck and the ones who are in possession of luck wins the game. But  winning the lottery is easy when you know what to do. There are may be  seven or eight lottery games and you have chances of winning at least four  or five of them if you a few simple rules. These tips and strategies given  below are proved to help win money 5 out of every ten times you play.   2. • How to win the lotto? You could play the same numbers every  game. Here I am not talking the whole lottery ticket numbers but  some. The more you play them the more the chances are that you  win the lottery. Pick a few numbers like four, seven, nine (these are  hypothetical numbers, you may choose whatever numbers you like)  and buy the lottery tickets that has all three in them. Buy as many  tickets as you can, the more you buy the more are your chances of  winning the lotto. It is a proved strategy to win the lottery and  many people believe that it is one way to make sure that the  jackpot hits your home.   3. • How to win the lottery? Another way to of winning the lottery is by selling  lotto and lottery tickets. If you are selling the lotto or lottery tickets then  you have good odds at your side. You will know what numbers are selling  and what numbers have a competition. You can choose your tickets  accordingly to win the lottery. You are going to be the house of the lottery  tickets and the house always wins. Winning the lottery will be easier this  way and the best part is that you will know that you are winning the lotto.   4. • How to win the lotto? Choose your game properly. Do not try to  play more than one game at a time. This means you are spending  double money on tickets for all these while you could have  concentrated this money on one game and you could have  increased your chances at winning it. You should play games that  not many people are playing; these are the games with small prize.  As almost everybody is concentrating on the big game your chances  of winning at these small games are better. You can buy more  tickets of these small jackpot games and increase your chances of  winning.   5. • Increase the number of times you play these  games. The more you play the better will be  the chances of you winning. Play more, for  example if you play ten times a month then  make it twenty times a month. The more you  play the more will be chances of you winning  the game. It goes with the tickets. Try to buy  more tickets because they are your weapon to  win the jackpot. The more tickets you have  the better it will be.
