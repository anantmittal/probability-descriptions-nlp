The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

View Archived Tables       The odds of dying from an injury in 2014 were 1 in 1,576 according to the latest data available.  The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

Insurance companies use various methods to calculate the value of a personal injury claim, which generally includes compensation for actual medical bills and lost wages, coupled with some amount of money for "pain and suffering." This article addresses how to calculate the value of a car accident claim using two common formulas - the multiplier method and the per diem method.  (We also have a calculator that compares the two methods, on this page . Keep in mind the outputs cover pain and suffering only - not the total claim value.)  The Multiplier Method  An often-used method for evaluating pain and suffering damages is to multiple the actual damages (medical bills and lost wages) by a certain number. Many personal injury lawyers have been trained to multiply the actual damages by three to reach a reasonable damages amount. So, if your medical bills were $5,000.00 and your lost wages were $1,000.00, you would multiply $6,000.00 by 3 for a total of $18,000.00.  In recent years, however, insurance companies have become more reluctant to automatically concede that a multiple of three is a reasonable way to quantify pain and suffering damages.  Now, the approach is often to take the actual damages and multiply that amount by a figure that is arrived at through the use of complex software programs, and the result will often undervalue your claim. The multiplier generally depends on the seriousness of your injuries, any aggravating circumstances, and the length of your recovery. For instance, if you suffer a broken femur and undergo multiple surgeries, the pain and suffering you experience is naturally going to be worse than that from a minor fender bender.  So, in the more serious accident, the multiplier might be three or four, whereas in the fender bender, the multiplier might be 1 or 2. The multiplier might be even higher if there are aggravating circumstances, such as the at-fault driver being intoxicated. In that case, you might reasonably use a higher multiplier. Likewise, if your own actions (or inactions) were partly to blame for the accident, it is reasonable to use a lower multiplier to evaluate your compensable pain and suffering.  (For more on this, see Determining a Multiplier to Value Your Personal Injury Case .)  It is also important to consider the type of treatment received in relation to the injuries incurred in choosing a reasonable multiplier. Some injury claimants seek an excessive amount of medical care in relationship to the injury sustained. For instance, one might obtain three or four months of chiropractic care of physical therapy for a minor injury. Insurance companies are usually unwilling to consider excessive medical treatment in their calculation of pain and suffering.  So, don’t keep treating for minor injuries in the hope that this will increase the value of your case. Over-treating injuries can often backfire, leaving you with unpaid medical bills and insufficient compensation.  The Daily Rate Method  Some insurers and personal injury attorneys use a daily rate to calculate the pain and suffering aspect of an injury claim. Under a daily rate or "per diem" calculation, an amount of money is assigned to each day (or week) that you suffer from injury after a car accident.  For example, suppose you incurred medical bills in the amount of $5,000.00 and lost income of $1,000.00 for a total of $6,000.00. For three months after the accident you saw a physician regularly and took daily pain medication. After about three months, the pain eased and you were able to resume normal activities again. You might assign a daily value of $200.00. Under the per diem method, you would multiple 90 days (3 months) by $200.00 to reach $18,000.00.  How do you choose the daily rate? One way might be to rely on the income you would make in a given day if you were not injured. So, if you typically earned $200.00 per day, but were unable to go to work, this might be a reasonable method of valuation.  While it may seem arbitrary to choose a per diem number, you should be able to articulate a legitimate reason for why you chose that amount. This is because when you take your case to a judge or jury, you cannot simply state "my pain and suffering is worth $200.00 per day." Rather, you will need to offer the jury or judge a reason upon which they can base such an award.  Getting a Final Value  Probably the most efficient and systematic way to value your claim is to use both the multiplier and per diem method to get a ballpark figure. From there you need to adjust your expectations based on a variety of factors, such as the severity of your injuries , whether others were involved and injured, the permanence of any injury , whether you were out of work for an extended period of time or laid off as a result of not working, and whether you believe you will make a strong witness on your own behalf.  Applying all these factors together will help you create a reasonable value for your claim. For instance, if your multiplier gives you a value of $18,000.00 and your per diem gives you a value of $30,000.00, you might choose a ballpark figure of $24,000.00. If you suffered a broken bone, underwent surgery, and may have a permanent limp, you should add some amount to your valuation. On the other hand, if you had a sprained wrist and the accident was partly your fault, you should subtract from that $24,000.00 figure.  Once you come up with a number that you're comfortable with as a starting point for settlement negotiations, it's time to craft your demand letter .

According to the National Safety Council, your odds of dying of various causes are:   Heart disease, 1 in 6  Cancer, 1 in 7  Stroke, 1 in 28  Motor vehicle accidents, 1 in 88  Intentional self-harm, 1 in 112  Accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances, 1 in 130  Falls, 1 in 171  Car crashes, 1 in 303  Assault by firearm, 1 in 306  Pedestrian, 1 in 649  Motorcycle rider, 1 in 770  Accidental drowning, 1 in 1,123  Exposure to smoke, fire, 1 in 1,177  Pedalcyclist 1 in 4,717  Firearms discharge, 1 in 6,309  Air and space transport accidents, 1 in 7,032  Electrocution, 1 in 9,943  Excessive natural heat, 1 in 12,517  Cataclysmic storm, 1 in 46,044  Lightning, 1 in 84,079  Legal execution, 1 in 96,691  Dog attack, 1 in 120,864  Earthquake or other ground movement, 1 in 148,756  Flood, 1 in 175,803  Fireworks discharge, 1 in 386,766                         Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                                                                              Thrillist        Food & Drink    Travel    Entertainment    All Sections    All Sections     Food & Drink      Travel      Entertainment      Video      Recipes         Cities     Most Popular     New York      Chicago      Los Angeles      San Francisco       All Cities    Atlanta    Atlantic City    Austin    Boston    Charleston    Charlotte    Chicago    Cleveland    Dallas    Denver    Detroit    Hamptons    Honolulu    Houston    Indianapolis    Las Vegas    Los Angeles    Louisville    Memphis    Miami    Milwaukee    Minneapolis    Nashville    New Orleans    New York    Philadelphia    Phoenix    Pittsburgh    Portland    San Antonio    San Diego    San Francisco    Seattle    Washington DC    Amsterdam    Berlin    London    Montreal    Paris    Toronto          Video        Top Series      Grilld      Eat This      The Explorers      Fork Yeah      Bottoms Up     See All      Most Popular                              This Is What It's Like to Run an Adult Summer Camp                                    This Caribbean Food Festival Puts Rum in Everything                                    This Jacket Holds 12 Beers                        search          Popular Searches    Best cars    Things you didnt know    Jets      Top Results           Near Me    Discover Bars & Restaurants      Subscribe         Cars             Thrillist      view navigation area     view search area       search Thrillist                                                Cars   Buckle Up: All 50 States, Ranked by How Likely You Are to Die in a Car Accident             By Aaron Miller   Published On 11/14/2015    @aaron_m_miller      By Aaron Miller   @aaron_m_miller    Published On 11/14/2015         Share on Facebook      Tweet this article      Pin it      Email                     Flickr/Alan Stark (edited)        Everyone knows driving is dangerous, if not from the gory low-budget movies they showed in drivers ed, then from the incessant phone calls you got from your parents the moment you turned 16. But just how dangerous, exactly? Turns out it varies wildly, depending on where you live.   To get an overarching look at how deadly the roads are in all 50 states, plus DC, we combined government data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. (Check out the table at the end to see the raw numbers for yourself.) Here's every state, ranked by how likely you are to be killed in a car crash, plus some other terrifying factoids. Hint: be careful when you're out walking around in Florida.

Washington, DC   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/32,322  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/14,053  Total population: 646,449  Total licensed drivers: 405,555  Total number of deaths in 2013: 20 How is it possible that the city topping our Worst Damn Freeways in America ranking comes in as the least likely place to die in a car? Well, probably because the freeways are so damn awful, people drive less: with an average of 8,697 miles per driver per year, people stay away from the the known horrors of the streets.              50. Massachusetts   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/20,530  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/11,421  Total population: 6,692,824  Total licensed drivers: 4,765,586  Total number of deaths in 2013: 326 With just 1.05 vehicles per licensed driver, Massachusetts has among the fewest cars per capita in the country.    49. New Jersey   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,419  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/7,772  Total population: 8,899,339  Total licensed drivers: 6,081,386  Total number of deaths in 2013: 542 This one really shouldn't be all that surprising, given the number of people who take trains into NYC every day.    48. New York   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,390  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/8,860  Total population: 19,651,127  Total licensed drivers: 11,210,723  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,199 The average New York driver actually drives a little bit more (12,154 miles) than the national average each year, though only 70% of all New Yorkers over the age of 16 actually have a license, and there's less than one car per licensed driver.              47. Rhode Island   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,177  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/9,144  Total population: 1,051,511  Total licensed drivers: 749,232  Total number of deaths in 2013: 65 Despite low overall numbers, a majority of fatal accidents in Rhode Island are single-car collisions.

Washington   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/15,989  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/8,032  Total population: 6,971,406  Total licensed drivers: 5,301,630  Total number of deaths in 2013: 436 Nearly 96% of Washington's of-age population has a license, but they don't drive all that much, averaging 8,949 miles per car.    45. Alaska   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,414  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,870  Total population: 735,132  Total licensed drivers: 528,873  Total number of deaths in 2013: 51 How many miles does the average Alaskan vehicle see in a year? It's 6,169. Of course, that could also be the height in inches of annual snowfall, so there's a reasonably correlative relationship here.              44. Minnesota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,006  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,523  Total population: 5,420,380  Total licensed drivers: 3,330,725  Total number of deaths in 2013: 387 Despite having more roads than all but four states, Minnesotans are among the least likely to get their licenses. Those that do, though, rack up over 17,000 mile per year, and are among the most likely to slam into someone else.    43. Hawaii   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,765  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,951  Total population: 1,404,054  Total licensed drivers: 915,033  Total number of deaths in 2013: 102 Hawaii has the fewest miles of road of any state in the union, and it's also among the roughest. Unsurprisingly, Hawaii has the fewest miles of road per fatal crash (48) of any state.              42. Utah   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,186  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,778  Total population: 2,900,872  Total licensed drivers: 1,661,219  Total number of deaths in 2013: 220 With 16,256 miles per driver, you might expect Utah to have more than 46,254 miles of road. Then again, one of the prime allures of the state is what you can do without roads.                   Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Ilirjan Rrumbullaku      41. Connecticut   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,029  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,672  Total population: 3,596,080  Total licensed drivers: 2,534,090  Total number of deaths in 2013: 276 Most adults in Connecticut have a license, and while they drive almost as much as the national average, one out of every 7,615 registered vehicles will be involved in a fatal accident each year.              40. Illinois   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,999  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,390  Total population: 12,882,135  Total licensed drivers: 8,261,582  Total number of deaths in 2013: 991 Even with the fourth most roads in the country, Illinoisans (Illini?) are actually pretty good about not putting themselves in life-threatening situations.    39. California   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,778  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,063  Total population: 38,332,521  Total licensed drivers: 24,390,236  Total number of deaths in 2013: 3,000 You're not actually better off in the car in California, but with a 1/43,363 chance of getting killed by a car even if you're not in a moving vehicle, it kinda seems like it sometimes.              38. Maryland   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,750  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,480  Total population: 5,928,814  Total licensed drivers: 4,140,105  Total number of deaths in 2013: 465 Cars in Maryland see 14,787 miles each year, despite having just 32,422 miles of road in the state. That probably speaks to the nightmare of commuting from the outskirts of DC more than anything else, but there's still less than one car per driver for the entire state.    37. Oregon   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,556  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,189  Total population: 3,930,065  Total licensed drivers: 2,773,373  Total number of deaths in 2013: 313 Oregon likes to consider itself a bicycle-friendly state, and with just 55 fatalities among people not inside a moving vehicle, there might very well be something to that.

Ohio   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/11,700  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,374  Total population: 11,570,808  Total licensed drivers: 8,030,421  Total number of deaths in 2013: 989 Interestingly, Ohio tied for the highest average number of vehicles per collision, with 1.62. In other words, people in Ohio are statistically less likely to hit stationary objects.    35. Virginia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/11,163  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,813  Total population: 8,260,405  Total licensed drivers: 5,602,765  Total number of deaths in 2013: 740 The average Virginian drives over 14,400 miles each year, though less than 85% of those eligible actually hold a license.              34. Colorado   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,953  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,295  Total population: 5,258,367  Total licensed drivers: 3,837,488  Total number of deaths in 2013: 481 Only three states have more deaths per collision than Colorado, though the reasons for that could be anything from high rates of SUV usage to carpooling.    33. Nevada   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,649  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,947  Total population: 2,790,136  Total licensed drivers: 1,756,095  Total number of deaths in 2013: 262 According to the statistics, there are two things you really don't want to be in Nevada: a pedestrian or a driver. Both have abnormally high death rates, while overall accidents and passenger deaths are pretty average.              32. Wisconsin   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,576  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,925  Total population: 5,742,713  Total licensed drivers: 4,171,427  Total number of deaths in 2013: 543 In somewhat of a paradox, Wisconsin ranks right up there with the best states for fewest deaths per fatality accident, but it's also one of the states with the most cars involved per collision.       related           All 50 States, Ranked by Their Roadside Attractions        related           Every State, Ranked by Its Food                    Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Peter Miller      31. Pennsylvania   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,574  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,095  Total population: 12,773,801  Total licensed drivers: 8,896,590  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,208 Pennsylvania is a vastly different state between its eastern and western halves, and while numbers would probably paint a very different picture between the two, our data doesn't break down like that, and the state averages out to middle of the pack.              30. Michigan   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,449  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,069  Total population: 9,895,622  Total licensed drivers: 6,986,587  Total number of deaths in 2013: 947 Michigan is nearly 30% smaller than Pennsylvania by population, and while the statistics bear that out across most categories, Michiganders actually drive almost as many total miles as their Big Ten neighbors.    29. New Hampshire   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,803  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,805  Total population: 1,323,459  Total licensed drivers: 1,061,433  Total number of deaths in 2013: 135 A total of 97.6% of all legal-age New Hampshirites hold a valid driver's license. They combine for among the fewest cars involved per accident of any state. Which means a lot of single car accidents, and collisions with stationary objects. Go figure?              28. Iowa   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,749  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,867  Total population: 3,090,416  Total licensed drivers: 2,143,665  Total number of deaths in 2013: 317 Iowans have more cars per driver than all but three other states, but despite being so car-heavy, it's the third safest state for pedestrians.    27. Delaware   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,351  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,208  Total population: 925,749  Total licensed drivers: 723,657  Total number of deaths in 2013: 99 All things considered, Delaware is relatively safe for drivers, though it's one of the more dangerous states for pedestrian traffic.

Vermont   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,082  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,973  Total population: 636,630  Total licensed drivers: 543,057  Total number of deaths in 2013: 69 Amazingly, Vermont has more licensed drivers than residents over the age of 16. It also has a disproportionately large number of passenger fatalities along its 14,266 miles of road.    24. Nebraska   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,856  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,089  Total population: 1,868,516  Total licensed drivers: 1,374,529  Total number of deaths in 2013: 211 Nebraska's pedestrians are among the safest in the country, with fewer than one out of every 100,000 residents struck each year.              23. Georgia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,475  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3,987  Total population: 9,992,167  Total licensed drivers: 6,607,016  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,179 Georgians put, on average, 14,055 miles on each car every year. Just two states top that, which makes Georgia's fatal crash-per-mile rate actually fairly good.    22. Indiana   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,392  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,004  Total population: 6,570,902  Total licensed drivers: 4,500,403  Total number of deaths in 2013: 783 Indiana's drivers actually average more miles per year than Georgia's, but they own more cars, too, with nearly one and a quarter per driver.

Florida   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,123  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3.972  Total population: 19,552,860  Total licensed drivers: 13,670,441  Total number of deaths in 2013: 2,407 If you're not in a moving vehicle, you have a 1 in 29,627 chance of being killed by a car in Florida. The 660 people to meet such a fate in 2013 were by far the most in the US.              19.

Oklahoma   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/5,679  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,547  Total population: 3,850,568  Total licensed drivers: 2,418,307  Total number of deaths in 2013: 678 Cause, meet effect: Oklahoma has a crash-per-mile rate that’s roughly in line with the other states in the top 10, but because OK drivers put so many miles on their car, they’re the second most likely to die in a crash. Simply put, it's because the average Oklahoman drives so much every year that death rate for drivers is the second highest in the country.              5. Alabama   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/5,673  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,889  Total population: 4,833,722  Total licensed drivers: 3,859,403  Total number of deaths in 2013: 852 Along with Virginia, Alabama is unusual in having more licensed drivers than residents over the age of 16.    4. West Virginia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/5,585  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,840  Total population: 1,854,304  Total licensed drivers: 1,177,136  Total number of deaths in 2013: 332 Only Texas, New York, and Washington DC have lower rates of licensed drivers.    3. North Dakota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/4,888  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,436  Total population: 723,393  Total licensed drivers: 513,838  Total number of deaths in 2013: 148 Good news and bad news for North Dakotans: pedestrians are far less likely to get hit in ND than any other state, and it's not even close. That said, drivers are most likely to die here, with one out of every 4,392 running out of luck, and one out of every 2,390 being involved in a crash that claimed a life.              2. Mississippi   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/4,880  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,516  Total population: 2,991,207  Total licensed drivers: 1,968,907  Total number of deaths in 2013: 613 Mississippians put 18,692 miles on the average vehicle, which is the most in the US by a wide margin. Then again, only Maryland, New York, and DC have fewer cars per driver.                   Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Jimmy Emerson      1.

Yet somehow, with just 1.31 vehicles involved per collision, it's the state where drivers are most likely to hit stationary objects. And yes, that also means it's on par with Florida for hitting pedestrians.                         Share on Facebook      Pin it        Aaron Miller/Thrillist     About the data  The data used here is from both the NHTSA's Fatal Accident Reporting System , and the FHWA .    The ranking itself is actually very basic: it's the total population of each state divided by the number of people killed in automotive accidents for the given year (2013).   The rest of the data involved, however, is where things get interesting:    Being Involved in a fatal crash : The NHTSA keeps such thorough accounts of every fatality accident that we know exactly how many people were in each vehicle for every single crash. Since surviving such an incident is inarguably a horrific and traumatizing experience, dividing the total population by the number of crashes is a sobering way to realize just how fragile life can be.    Being involved, as a driver: Simply put, the more you drive, the higher your chances of being involved in an incident. We took the population of licensed drivers and divided by the total number of accidents.              Dying in a crash, as a driver: Similar to being involved in a crash, because the NHTSA actually notes who was injured or killed while sitting where in a vehicle, we were able to calculate the odds of dying as a driver by dividing the licensed population by the number of people who died while driving.    Dying while you're not even in a moving vehicle: This includes pedestrians, bicyclists, people inside buildings that get driven into, and parked cars. Basically, anyone who's not out in traffic in a vehicle. As you might expect, it's the total population divided by the number of people who were struck and killed.    There are some problems with the data: While the statistics clearly show a trend toward safer urban driving, they are skewed in areas with well-developed mass transit. The percentage of people who have a license and don't drive is not accounted for in the data, and would potentially skew a few areas where car use is less prevalent.              Closing thoughts  It's more than a little somber to realize that every one of these numbers was caused by the death of someone's spouse, parent, or child. Still, the data is fairly conclusive that rural driving is far more likely to kill you than urban driving -- and the FHWA has the specific breakdowns of this on its site . This data didn't look into exactly why that is, but issues like proximity to first-rate medical care and vehicle speed -- since you're not crawling along in traffic -- are likely greater factors in rural areas.   Interestingly, the number of vehicles per crash doesn't appear to bear significant correlation to how many people die in each crash. Presumably, that number is more dependent on other factors (weather, intoxication, time of day), than it is on the violence of the collision itself.

The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

Car Crashes Versus Other Fatalities   By Matt Schmitz  October 16, 2015    Share                       <meta itemprop="width" content="1170">
                        <meta itemprop="height" content="1170">   Cars.com graphic by Paul Dolan      CARS.COM — "On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero," author Chuck Palahniuk wrote. It's true: In this life we're all basically riding in one big car together, and everyone's just getting out at different stops. Since we at Cars.com are in the business of automobiles and have a vested interest in safety, we wanted to know how fatalities from driving accidents stack up against other fatalities in terms of probability.   Related: DUI Fatalities Continue Decades-Long Slide  The answer: competitively. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, car-accident fatalities have declined by more than a third in just the past three years. This continues a long period of decline since 1985 amid motor vehicles' ever-improving structural designs and the addition of advanced safety features. Even so, death by car remains a formidable obstacle to reaching the average U.S. life expectancy of 78.8 years.  "Motor vehicle traffic" deaths in the U.S. in 2013, the most recent full year of data available, totaled 33,804, for a death rate of 10.7 per 100,000, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Considering deaths in the U.S. that year totaled slightly less than 2.6 million, the individual American driver's odds of dying as a result of an injury sustained in an automobile crash (which include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists involved in car crashes) come out to about 1 in 77 — making it one of the highest-probability causes of death tracked by the CDC.  That car-accident figure compares to fatalities caused by firearms (also a odds of 1 in 77), falls (1 in 83), suicide (1 in 63) and poisoning (1 in 53). By contrast, heart disease, the leading cause of death, kills 1 in 4 people, accidents in general kill 1 in 20, alcohol and drugs kill 1 in 34, as does diabetes, and influenza and pneumonia kill 1 in 46. Meanwhile 1 in 161 die of homicide, 1 in 276 of skin cancer, 1 in 640 of drowning and 1 in 821 of fire.  Of those 33,804 people killed in motor-vehicle accidents, statistics show that: Occupants of the involved vehicles accounted for 8,629, with a death rate of 2.7 per 100,000 and a 1 in 301 chance of dying; pedestrians, 4,989, 1.6 death rate and a 1 in 521 chance; motorcyclists, 4,169, 1.3 death rate and a 1 in 623 chance; bicyclists, 623, 0.2 death rate and a 1 in 4,169 chance; unspecified victims, 15,388, 4.9 death rate and a 1 in 169 chance.  The top 10 states where you're most likely to die in an auto accident, including the number of deaths and death rate per 100,000 people, are:  1. Montana, 237; 23.3  2. Mississippi, 681; 22.8  3. Oklahoma, 727; 18.9  4. Alabama, 909; 18.8  5. Arkansas, 537; 18.1  6. West Virginia, 330; 17.8  7. South Dakota; 145; 17.2  8. North Dakota; 124; 17.1  9. South Carolina; 786; 16.5  10. Louisiana; 761; 16.5  The top 10 states (including the District of Columbia) where you're least likely to die in an auto accident are:  1. District of Columbia, 30; 4.6  2. Massachusetts, 375; 5.6  3. New Jersey, 564; 6.3  4. New York, 1,316; 6.7  5. Rhode Island, 77; 7.3  6. Washington, 537; 7.7  7. Utah, 230; 7.9  8. Hawaii, 112; 8.0  9. Connecticut, 300; 8.3  10. Minnesota, 466; 8.6  On the more hopeful side, despite car accidents still posing a significant risk to person's everyday lives, the roads are getting decidedly less dangerous. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, in the DOT's Fast Lane blog, noted that according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates, highway fatalities in 2014 dropped to their lowest level ever, and were likely to continue on that path in years to come.  "A recent NHTSA study shows that new vehicle safety technologies — from seat belts to electronic stability control — saved 614,000 lives," Foxx wrote. "The vehicles we drive today are loaded with technology, and they are safer than they've ever been.  "But we're not stopping there. In coming years, connected vehicle technologies like crash-avoidance systems and automated driving will very likely change the game."

Or overdue. Continue Reading Below By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That&apos;s if you&apos;re an average driver, which, whether you&apos;re willing to admit it or not, you likely are. So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you&apos;ll experience some kind of crash by the time you&apos;re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents. Chances are these crashes won&apos;t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities. But these crashes most likely will be costly. More than 2 million people are injured in crashes every year. In 2010, the average claim for injuries to cover both the insured driver and others involved in the crash had risen to $23,450, thanks in large part to soaring medical costs, according to the Insurance Research Council, a nonprofit research group. More On This... Eight Extreme Cases of Insurance Fraud How Much Car Insurance is Enough? Advertisement [Let CarInsurance.com help you find affordable auto insurance now.] Accidents on the installment plan Which brings us to why this little-known number is so critical. (We got the accident-every-18-years statistic from the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, a trade association that analyzes insurance data.) Insurance companies may sell protection -- and one night of TV advertisements suggests that they do a pretty good job on this front -- but they&apos;re in the game to make a profit. And they don&apos;t make a profit by paying for your accidents. They do so by getting you to pay for your accidents -- in advance. You&apos;re paying a smaller portion over a longer period of time, explains Dee Dee Mays, an actuary with Perr&Knight, an insurance consultancy. It&apos;s kind of a way to spread your risk. How to price your insurance rates low enough to lure you from a competitor, but high enough to make a profit on your future accidents, involves elaborate risk assessments that constitute the secret sauce of the insurance business. But all can be boiled down to the need to determine two things: *How many accidents will occur? Or, put another way, how likely is each driver in each car to have an accident? And, *How much will each accident cost? You&apos;re already a statistic How often you&apos;re considered due for that next accident depends a little, too, on your insurer. A company that insures large numbers of young drivers - who are far more likely to have accidents -- will likely budget for a shorter gap between crashes. State Farm, the country&apos;s largest auto insurance company, has customers with slightly lower-than-average accident rates. "If we just take collisions, the average State Farm policy holder has a collision claim once every 19 years," says State Farm spokesman Dick Luedke. But odds are made to be beaten, right? Many factors are beyond a driver&apos;s immediate control. Clearly you can&apos;t alter road conditions or medical costs, at least by the time your insurance bill is due. That, in the insurance game, makes you a firm stat: a driver paying for the accident he&apos;s expected to have every 17.9 years. But there are some ways you can move the needle, ways that will both change your lifetime-accident rate and lower your insurance premium. Assuming that, at least today, you can&apos;t change your age, your driving history, or what kind of car you drive, here are some behaviors you can incorporate to lower your accident risk and, in the end, your insurance rates. Don&apos;t drive impaired. No single factor is more likely to cause an accident than a driver impaired by alcohol or other drugs. One-third of fatal accidents in this country are attributed to drunken drivers alone. Don&apos;t drive during the vampire hour. The deadliest three-hour periods on American roadways are between midnight and 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of those fatal crashes, 66% involve alcohol-impaired driving. Keep your eyes on the road. NHTSA data show that 995 of the 30,797 fatal crashes in 2009 involved drivers using cell phones. Nearly, 5,500 traffic deaths involved a driver distracted by something inside the car, including technology, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Don&apos;t speed. Nearly one-third of all fatal accidents are attributed to speeding or driving too fast for conditions. Speeding is the single greatest contributor to accidents other than impaired driving. Insurance companies love such proven risk factors when assessing rates. Anyone who&apos;s seen their premiums skyrocket after getting a ticket knows this well. Avoid congestion. Less than a quarter of both injury crashes and non-injury crashes in 2009 occurred on roadways with a posted speed limit of 55 mph or higher. Fewer intersections apparently make for fewer crashes. Be careful, though: When accidents do occur on these highways, they are more likely to be deadly, accounting for nearly half of all traffic fatalities.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

Insurance companies use various methods to calculate the value of a personal injury claim, which generally includes compensation for actual medical bills and lost wages, coupled with some amount of money for "pain and suffering." This article addresses how to calculate the value of a car accident claim using two common formulas - the multiplier method and the per diem method.  (We also have a calculator that compares the two methods, on this page . Keep in mind the outputs cover pain and suffering only - not the total claim value.)  The Multiplier Method  An often-used method for evaluating pain and suffering damages is to multiple the actual damages (medical bills and lost wages) by a certain number. Many personal injury lawyers have been trained to multiply the actual damages by three to reach a reasonable damages amount. So, if your medical bills were $5,000.00 and your lost wages were $1,000.00, you would multiply $6,000.00 by 3 for a total of $18,000.00.  In recent years, however, insurance companies have become more reluctant to automatically concede that a multiple of three is a reasonable way to quantify pain and suffering damages.  Now, the approach is often to take the actual damages and multiply that amount by a figure that is arrived at through the use of complex software programs, and the result will often undervalue your claim. The multiplier generally depends on the seriousness of your injuries, any aggravating circumstances, and the length of your recovery. For instance, if you suffer a broken femur and undergo multiple surgeries, the pain and suffering you experience is naturally going to be worse than that from a minor fender bender.  So, in the more serious accident, the multiplier might be three or four, whereas in the fender bender, the multiplier might be 1 or 2. The multiplier might be even higher if there are aggravating circumstances, such as the at-fault driver being intoxicated. In that case, you might reasonably use a higher multiplier. Likewise, if your own actions (or inactions) were partly to blame for the accident, it is reasonable to use a lower multiplier to evaluate your compensable pain and suffering.  (For more on this, see Determining a Multiplier to Value Your Personal Injury Case .)  It is also important to consider the type of treatment received in relation to the injuries incurred in choosing a reasonable multiplier. Some injury claimants seek an excessive amount of medical care in relationship to the injury sustained. For instance, one might obtain three or four months of chiropractic care of physical therapy for a minor injury. Insurance companies are usually unwilling to consider excessive medical treatment in their calculation of pain and suffering.  So, don’t keep treating for minor injuries in the hope that this will increase the value of your case. Over-treating injuries can often backfire, leaving you with unpaid medical bills and insufficient compensation.  The Daily Rate Method  Some insurers and personal injury attorneys use a daily rate to calculate the pain and suffering aspect of an injury claim. Under a daily rate or "per diem" calculation, an amount of money is assigned to each day (or week) that you suffer from injury after a car accident.  For example, suppose you incurred medical bills in the amount of $5,000.00 and lost income of $1,000.00 for a total of $6,000.00. For three months after the accident you saw a physician regularly and took daily pain medication. After about three months, the pain eased and you were able to resume normal activities again. You might assign a daily value of $200.00. Under the per diem method, you would multiple 90 days (3 months) by $200.00 to reach $18,000.00.  How do you choose the daily rate? One way might be to rely on the income you would make in a given day if you were not injured. So, if you typically earned $200.00 per day, but were unable to go to work, this might be a reasonable method of valuation.  While it may seem arbitrary to choose a per diem number, you should be able to articulate a legitimate reason for why you chose that amount. This is because when you take your case to a judge or jury, you cannot simply state "my pain and suffering is worth $200.00 per day." Rather, you will need to offer the jury or judge a reason upon which they can base such an award.  Getting a Final Value  Probably the most efficient and systematic way to value your claim is to use both the multiplier and per diem method to get a ballpark figure. From there you need to adjust your expectations based on a variety of factors, such as the severity of your injuries , whether others were involved and injured, the permanence of any injury , whether you were out of work for an extended period of time or laid off as a result of not working, and whether you believe you will make a strong witness on your own behalf.  Applying all these factors together will help you create a reasonable value for your claim. For instance, if your multiplier gives you a value of $18,000.00 and your per diem gives you a value of $30,000.00, you might choose a ballpark figure of $24,000.00. If you suffered a broken bone, underwent surgery, and may have a permanent limp, you should add some amount to your valuation. On the other hand, if you had a sprained wrist and the accident was partly your fault, you should subtract from that $24,000.00 figure.  Once you come up with a number that you're comfortable with as a starting point for settlement negotiations, it's time to craft your demand letter .

Turns out it varies wildly, depending on where you live.   To get an overarching look at how deadly the roads are in all 50 states, plus DC, we combined government data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. (Check out the table at the end to see the raw numbers for yourself.) Here's every state, ranked by how likely you are to be killed in a car crash, plus some other terrifying factoids. Hint: be careful when you're out walking around in Florida.

Well, probably because the freeways are so damn awful, people drive less: with an average of 8,697 miles per driver per year, people stay away from the the known horrors of the streets.              50. Massachusetts   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/20,530  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/11,421  Total population: 6,692,824  Total licensed drivers: 4,765,586  Total number of deaths in 2013: 326 With just 1.05 vehicles per licensed driver, Massachusetts has among the fewest cars per capita in the country.    49. New Jersey   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,419  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/7,772  Total population: 8,899,339  Total licensed drivers: 6,081,386  Total number of deaths in 2013: 542 This one really shouldn't be all that surprising, given the number of people who take trains into NYC every day.    48. New York   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,390  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/8,860  Total population: 19,651,127  Total licensed drivers: 11,210,723  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,199 The average New York driver actually drives a little bit more (12,154 miles) than the national average each year, though only 70% of all New Yorkers over the age of 16 actually have a license, and there's less than one car per licensed driver.              47.

It's 6,169. Of course, that could also be the height in inches of annual snowfall, so there's a reasonably correlative relationship here.              44. Minnesota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,006  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,523  Total population: 5,420,380  Total licensed drivers: 3,330,725  Total number of deaths in 2013: 387 Despite having more roads than all but four states, Minnesotans are among the least likely to get their licenses. Those that do, though, rack up over 17,000 mile per year, and are among the most likely to slam into someone else.    43. Hawaii   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,765  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,951  Total population: 1,404,054  Total licensed drivers: 915,033  Total number of deaths in 2013: 102 Hawaii has the fewest miles of road of any state in the union, and it's also among the roughest. Unsurprisingly, Hawaii has the fewest miles of road per fatal crash (48) of any state.              42. Utah   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,186  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,778  Total population: 2,900,872  Total licensed drivers: 1,661,219  Total number of deaths in 2013: 220 With 16,256 miles per driver, you might expect Utah to have more than 46,254 miles of road. Then again, one of the prime allures of the state is what you can do without roads.                   Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Ilirjan Rrumbullaku      41.

New Hampshire   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,803  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,805  Total population: 1,323,459  Total licensed drivers: 1,061,433  Total number of deaths in 2013: 135 A total of 97.6% of all legal-age New Hampshirites hold a valid driver's license. They combine for among the fewest cars involved per accident of any state. Which means a lot of single car accidents, and collisions with stationary objects. Go figure?              28.

Simply put, it's because the average Oklahoman drives so much every year that death rate for drivers is the second highest in the country.              5.

Share on Facebook      Pin it        Aaron Miller/Thrillist     About the data  The data used here is from both the NHTSA's Fatal Accident Reporting System , and the FHWA .    The ranking itself is actually very basic: it's the total population of each state divided by the number of people killed in automotive accidents for the given year (2013).   The rest of the data involved, however, is where things get interesting:    Being Involved in a fatal crash : The NHTSA keeps such thorough accounts of every fatality accident that we know exactly how many people were in each vehicle for every single crash. Since surviving such an incident is inarguably a horrific and traumatizing experience, dividing the total population by the number of crashes is a sobering way to realize just how fragile life can be.    Being involved, as a driver: Simply put, the more you drive, the higher your chances of being involved in an incident. We took the population of licensed drivers and divided by the total number of accidents.              Dying in a crash, as a driver: Similar to being involved in a crash, because the NHTSA actually notes who was injured or killed while sitting where in a vehicle, we were able to calculate the odds of dying as a driver by dividing the licensed population by the number of people who died while driving.    Dying while you're not even in a moving vehicle: This includes pedestrians, bicyclists, people inside buildings that get driven into, and parked cars. Basically, anyone who's not out in traffic in a vehicle. As you might expect, it's the total population divided by the number of people who were struck and killed.    There are some problems with the data: While the statistics clearly show a trend toward safer urban driving, they are skewed in areas with well-developed mass transit. The percentage of people who have a license and don't drive is not accounted for in the data, and would potentially skew a few areas where car use is less prevalent.              Closing thoughts  It's more than a little somber to realize that every one of these numbers was caused by the death of someone's spouse, parent, or child. Still, the data is fairly conclusive that rural driving is far more likely to kill you than urban driving -- and the FHWA has the specific breakdowns of this on its site . This data didn't look into exactly why that is, but issues like proximity to first-rate medical care and vehicle speed -- since you're not crawling along in traffic -- are likely greater factors in rural areas.   Interestingly, the number of vehicles per crash doesn't appear to bear significant correlation to how many people die in each crash. Presumably, that number is more dependent on other factors (weather, intoxication, time of day), than it is on the violence of the collision itself.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration.

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

Car Crashes Versus Other Fatalities   By Matt Schmitz  October 16, 2015    Share                       <meta itemprop="width" content="1170">
                        <meta itemprop="height" content="1170">   Cars.com graphic by Paul Dolan      CARS.COM — "On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero," author Chuck Palahniuk wrote. It's true: In this life we're all basically riding in one big car together, and everyone's just getting out at different stops. Since we at Cars.com are in the business of automobiles and have a vested interest in safety, we wanted to know how fatalities from driving accidents stack up against other fatalities in terms of probability.   Related: DUI Fatalities Continue Decades-Long Slide  The answer: competitively. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, car-accident fatalities have declined by more than a third in just the past three years. This continues a long period of decline since 1985 amid motor vehicles' ever-improving structural designs and the addition of advanced safety features. Even so, death by car remains a formidable obstacle to reaching the average U.S. life expectancy of 78.8 years.  "Motor vehicle traffic" deaths in the U.S. in 2013, the most recent full year of data available, totaled 33,804, for a death rate of 10.7 per 100,000, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Considering deaths in the U.S. that year totaled slightly less than 2.6 million, the individual American driver's odds of dying as a result of an injury sustained in an automobile crash (which include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists involved in car crashes) come out to about 1 in 77 — making it one of the highest-probability causes of death tracked by the CDC.  That car-accident figure compares to fatalities caused by firearms (also a odds of 1 in 77), falls (1 in 83), suicide (1 in 63) and poisoning (1 in 53). By contrast, heart disease, the leading cause of death, kills 1 in 4 people, accidents in general kill 1 in 20, alcohol and drugs kill 1 in 34, as does diabetes, and influenza and pneumonia kill 1 in 46. Meanwhile 1 in 161 die of homicide, 1 in 276 of skin cancer, 1 in 640 of drowning and 1 in 821 of fire.  Of those 33,804 people killed in motor-vehicle accidents, statistics show that: Occupants of the involved vehicles accounted for 8,629, with a death rate of 2.7 per 100,000 and a 1 in 301 chance of dying; pedestrians, 4,989, 1.6 death rate and a 1 in 521 chance; motorcyclists, 4,169, 1.3 death rate and a 1 in 623 chance; bicyclists, 623, 0.2 death rate and a 1 in 4,169 chance; unspecified victims, 15,388, 4.9 death rate and a 1 in 169 chance.  The top 10 states where you're most likely to die in an auto accident, including the number of deaths and death rate per 100,000 people, are:  1. Montana, 237; 23.3  2. Mississippi, 681; 22.8  3. Oklahoma, 727; 18.9  4. Alabama, 909; 18.8  5. Arkansas, 537; 18.1  6. West Virginia, 330; 17.8  7. South Dakota; 145; 17.2  8. North Dakota; 124; 17.1  9. South Carolina; 786; 16.5  10. Louisiana; 761; 16.5  The top 10 states (including the District of Columbia) where you're least likely to die in an auto accident are:  1. District of Columbia, 30; 4.6  2. Massachusetts, 375; 5.6  3. New Jersey, 564; 6.3  4. New York, 1,316; 6.7  5. Rhode Island, 77; 7.3  6. Washington, 537; 7.7  7. Utah, 230; 7.9  8. Hawaii, 112; 8.0  9. Connecticut, 300; 8.3  10. Minnesota, 466; 8.6  On the more hopeful side, despite car accidents still posing a significant risk to person's everyday lives, the roads are getting decidedly less dangerous. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, in the DOT's Fast Lane blog, noted that according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates, highway fatalities in 2014 dropped to their lowest level ever, and were likely to continue on that path in years to come.  "A recent NHTSA study shows that new vehicle safety technologies — from seat belts to electronic stability control — saved 614,000 lives," Foxx wrote. "The vehicles we drive today are loaded with technology, and they are safer than they've ever been.  "But we're not stopping there. In coming years, connected vehicle technologies like crash-avoidance systems and automated driving will very likely change the game."

And all those car crash videos appearing on the internet have us thinking about the likelihood of getting into an accident (among other things). This infographic examines the likelihoods of a few driving (and non-driving) situations, like getting into a car accident, being pulled over, and receiving a ticket after getting pulled over. Of course, these numbers vary by city and state. But you as a driver have the ability to improve your odds, so play it safe and save that text for later!

Or overdue. Continue Reading Below By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That&apos;s if you&apos;re an average driver, which, whether you&apos;re willing to admit it or not, you likely are. So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you&apos;ll experience some kind of crash by the time you&apos;re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents. Chances are these crashes won&apos;t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities. But these crashes most likely will be costly. More than 2 million people are injured in crashes every year. In 2010, the average claim for injuries to cover both the insured driver and others involved in the crash had risen to $23,450, thanks in large part to soaring medical costs, according to the Insurance Research Council, a nonprofit research group. More On This... Eight Extreme Cases of Insurance Fraud How Much Car Insurance is Enough? Advertisement [Let CarInsurance.com help you find affordable auto insurance now.] Accidents on the installment plan Which brings us to why this little-known number is so critical. (We got the accident-every-18-years statistic from the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, a trade association that analyzes insurance data.) Insurance companies may sell protection -- and one night of TV advertisements suggests that they do a pretty good job on this front -- but they&apos;re in the game to make a profit. And they don&apos;t make a profit by paying for your accidents. They do so by getting you to pay for your accidents -- in advance. You&apos;re paying a smaller portion over a longer period of time, explains Dee Dee Mays, an actuary with Perr&Knight, an insurance consultancy. It&apos;s kind of a way to spread your risk. How to price your insurance rates low enough to lure you from a competitor, but high enough to make a profit on your future accidents, involves elaborate risk assessments that constitute the secret sauce of the insurance business. But all can be boiled down to the need to determine two things: *How many accidents will occur? Or, put another way, how likely is each driver in each car to have an accident? And, *How much will each accident cost? You&apos;re already a statistic How often you&apos;re considered due for that next accident depends a little, too, on your insurer. A company that insures large numbers of young drivers - who are far more likely to have accidents -- will likely budget for a shorter gap between crashes. State Farm, the country&apos;s largest auto insurance company, has customers with slightly lower-than-average accident rates. "If we just take collisions, the average State Farm policy holder has a collision claim once every 19 years," says State Farm spokesman Dick Luedke. But odds are made to be beaten, right? Many factors are beyond a driver&apos;s immediate control. Clearly you can&apos;t alter road conditions or medical costs, at least by the time your insurance bill is due. That, in the insurance game, makes you a firm stat: a driver paying for the accident he&apos;s expected to have every 17.9 years. But there are some ways you can move the needle, ways that will both change your lifetime-accident rate and lower your insurance premium. Assuming that, at least today, you can&apos;t change your age, your driving history, or what kind of car you drive, here are some behaviors you can incorporate to lower your accident risk and, in the end, your insurance rates. Don&apos;t drive impaired. No single factor is more likely to cause an accident than a driver impaired by alcohol or other drugs. One-third of fatal accidents in this country are attributed to drunken drivers alone. Don&apos;t drive during the vampire hour. The deadliest three-hour periods on American roadways are between midnight and 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of those fatal crashes, 66% involve alcohol-impaired driving. Keep your eyes on the road. NHTSA data show that 995 of the 30,797 fatal crashes in 2009 involved drivers using cell phones. Nearly, 5,500 traffic deaths involved a driver distracted by something inside the car, including technology, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Don&apos;t speed. Nearly one-third of all fatal accidents are attributed to speeding or driving too fast for conditions. Speeding is the single greatest contributor to accidents other than impaired driving. Insurance companies love such proven risk factors when assessing rates. Anyone who&apos;s seen their premiums skyrocket after getting a ticket knows this well. Avoid congestion. Less than a quarter of both injury crashes and non-injury crashes in 2009 occurred on roadways with a posted speed limit of 55 mph or higher. Fewer intersections apparently make for fewer crashes. Be careful, though: When accidents do occur on these highways, they are more likely to be deadly, accounting for nearly half of all traffic fatalities.
