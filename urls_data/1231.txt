You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Visit our community    Can you really choose the sex of your baby? For as long as we've been making babies , women have been exchanging ideas about how to increase their chances of having either a boy or a girl. Unfortunately there's no medical evidence that any of them actually work!  Having said that, there'll always be a mum who tells you an old wives' tale worked for her. So if you fancy defying the experts and trying to tip the balance towards one sex yourself, why not try some of the suggestions below.   You're more likely to conceive a boy if... You have sex on the day of ovulation , as male sperm are thought to swim faster and reach the egg first. You reach orgasm before your partner, as this releases an alkaline fluid, thought to be more male-sperm friendly than the vagina's natural acidity. You have deep penetration during sex, such as from behind (doggie-style). Your partner has a high sperm count. This is because male sperm are not as strong as female sperm, and so the higher the count, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first. You avoid sex for a week before ovulation and then only have sex once on ovulation day, to keep the sperm count high. Your partner suggested the love-making. You make love at night. You make love on odd days of the month. Your partner keeps his genitals cool by wearing boxer shorts and loose-fitting trousers. You eat salty food, plenty of meat, fish, white flour, pasta, fresh fruit, certain vegetables, but avoid milk and dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, nuts, chocolate, shellfish and wholemeal bread. You're more likely to conceive a girl if... You have sex earlier on in your cycle, a few days before your day of ovulation. This is because female sperm are thought to be stronger and therefore last longer than male sperm, who will die off before reaching the egg. Your partner reaches orgasm before you. You have sex frequently to lower your partner's sperm count, and so increase the chances of the female sperm reaching the egg first. You keep penetration shallow. You stop having unprotected sex four to five days before ovulation, to minimise the chances of the male sperm reaching the egg first. Your partner keeps his genitals warm by wearing close-fitting underwear and tight trousers (although this isn't likely to do his general fertility any good!) You suggested the love-making. You make love in the afternoon. You make love on even days of the month. You put a wooden spoon under your bed and a pink ribbon under your pillow. You drink plenty of milk and eat dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, unsalted foods, rice, pasta, certain vegetables, mineral water, limited amounts of meat and potatoes, but avoid salt and any salty foods, wine and beer, fresh fruit, spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms, chocolate, coffee and tea.

I have two boys and have been blogging about wanting to have a girl for some time. I had gone through most of the experiences posted by women, like gender dieting, douching etc but they didn't really make any sense to me. Ultimately, I picked Urobiologics (based in the US) who have literally proven that, although gender is 'determined' by sperms, women select the gender of the baby based on the cycle she conceives, by choosing to conceive in the correct alternating cycle. We were given a conception plan to try to conceive in the girl cycle (you send off urine samples to Urobiologics, who will then determine when you will be in a boy or girl cycle). We became pregnant with our girl (we used their post-gender test to check the gender of the baby at around 7 weeks). Sadly our little Poppy girl died at 16 weeks (31 Oct) due to a PPROM, so we are leaving it a couple of months to heal and then go via the PreGender Preconception Test route again. I'm ready now!

Top tips for conceiving a girl   What’s a fact and what’s fallacy?   Timing of intercourse   How do I know when I’ve ovulated?   General tips to help conceive a girl  Are you longing for a girl? Do you already have a one boy or more and now want to see if you can tip the gender balance in your household? There are lots of theories and claims made about influencing the chances of having either a boy or a girl baby, but the scientific facts are absolutely clear. The chances of having a boy or a girl are almost exactly equal for each and every pregnancy. Even though some couples only seem to make boys, or girls, this patterning owes more to luck than management.   Top tips for conceiving a girl   have sex 2.5-4 days before you ovulate  keep an ovulation chart so you know when you are ovulating  have sex every day from the day when you finish your period  avoid having sex which involves deep penetration – missionary position is best  purchase an alkaline testing kit from the pharmacy to find out your vaginal ph  eat foods that support a more acidic vaginal ph, like green leafy vegetables, wholegrains, meat, sweets, corn and blueberries    What’s a fact and what’s fallacy?   To conceive with a girl, an X chromosome linked sperm from your partner needs to get to your egg first.  If a Y linked sperm gets in before an X, then you will have a boy.  It’s important to remember that it is always the man who determines the sex of the baby.   Women always carry a pair of X chromosomes whereas men carry an X and Y.  It is a fallacy that men who are less masculine father girls.  It is a fallacy that one of the testicles only produces X (girl) sperm and the other only produces Y (boy) sperm.  Lunar cycles, diet , sexual positions, homeopathy and assorted complimentary medicine practices do no influence the likelihood of having a boy or a girl.   If you really want to minimise your chances of having a boy and maximise the odds of having a girl, then gender selection through a fertility clinic is your best bet. But in Australia at the current time, just having a preference for one gender more than the other is insufficient reason to sign up. This process is tremendously expensive and fraught with potential problems, especially if the desired baby is not the ‘right’ gender.  So, unless there is a strong likelihood of your baby carrying a sex linked chromosomal abnormality, it is unlikely that using a gender selection clinic is an option for you.    Characteristics of girl sperm  What this means to you    Tend to be slow moving and longer lasting.  Interesting point, but really doesn’t mean much in terms of your control.    Are real little energy houses which survive for longer in hostile vaginal conditions.  Again, interesting to note. May influence when you have sex in relation to your ovulation.    Can survive in the vagina for up to four days without dying off.  Don’t need to be so specific about timing sex to coincide with ovulation-such as when aiming for a boy .      Characteristics of boy sperm  What this means to you    Are not as long lasting, need assistance to get to the egg as quickly as possible.  Time sex to coincide with ovulation if you want a boy .   Have lots of energy at the start but don’t have the staying power which girl sperm do.  Stop trying to conceive around three days before you ovulate if you want a girl. But bear in mind, this will reduce your overall odds of conceiving as well.   Timing of intercourse If you are keen to have girl, then you need to think about, plan for and execute your strategy to include exactly how and when you are going to have sex. Forget just waiting to see what happens or being relaxed about it. Bear in mind that in order to maximise your chances of conceiving either a boy or a girl then you need to have produced an egg which the sperm can then fertilise. Having lots of sex throughout your cycle will provide you with the best chances of having any baby. If you limit the opportunity for conception to occur this will in turn, reduce your chances of having either a boy or a girl. In the 1960’s Dr. Shettles developed a range of strategies which could boost the probability of parents having either a girl or a boy. According to Shettles, to conceive a girl you need to:  Have sex 2.5 – 4 days before you ovulate . Timing sex is the key here, so it would help if you keep an ovulation chart where you can predict what days of your cycle you are likely to ovulate and have lots of sex before you release an egg.  Have sex everyday from the day when you finish your period. This helps to deposit lots of the longer lasting X sperm so they are ready to fertilise the egg once it is released from the ovaries.  Preparation is the key to conceiving a girl. Don’t wait for the last moment to have sex. Boosting your chances of having a girl is similar to saving for a home loan. Make lots of deposits nice and early and then, when the time is right you are in the best position to gain the rewards.  Shettles also advises that if couples want to conceive with a girl:  Avoid having sex at the time when you ovulate or just afterwards. Having sex when ovulation is still some days away supports the slower moving X sperm.  Mucous which is produced before ovulation tends to be more acidic and this helps to conceive with a girl. Women who are sensitive to their body’s changes are in the best possible position to know when they are fertile.  If manageable, women need to avoid having an orgasm during sex. Shettles claims female orgasm helps to produce a more alkaline vaginal environment which favours boy sperm. The muscular uterine contractions also give the boy sperm a boost towards the fallopian tubes which is where conception usually takes place.   How do I know when I’ve ovulated?  Many women develop a distinctive pain on one side of their lower pelvis, which occurs mid-way through their monthly cycle.  Changes in the cervical mucous. Fertile mucous is clear, watery and stretchy – it appears similar to egg white. This is because the cells change to encourage the smooth passage of sperm upwards through the cervix towards the fallopian tubes. Fertile mucous is also less acidic than non-fertile mucous and this environment favours the sperm rather than killing them off.  You could try using an ovulation testing kit. These detect hormonal changes which occur at ovulation, particularly an increase in Luteinizing Hormone. But there is still some disagreement over their effectiveness. Kits cost anywhere between $25.00 – $40.00 (see below).  You may feel different. Women who have ovulated and are at their most fertile often experience an increase in their libido; they appear more attractive and are more relaxed.  An increase in your basal body temperature. This is the lowest temperature which is attained by your body during rest and sleep. Just before ovulation occurs there is a rise in the temperature by a couple of degrees.  Bear in mind that the ovulation testing kits which work by measuring hormonal levels in the saliva, rather than the urine, are supposed to be more exact.  General tips to help conceive a girl  Avoid having sex which involves deep penetration. The missionary position may be preferable because the semen/sperm are not deposited as closely to the cervix as the all fours position. A shallow position is preferable when trying to have a girl baby.  Enlist your partner’s cooperation if you’re trying to have a girl. There may be changes from your usual sexual routine. Communication and shared decision making will go a long way towards avoiding misunderstandings at ‘delicate’ moments.  It seems that girl sperm favour a more acidic environment. This is largely out of your control though there may be some foods which favour the acidic ph. Alkaline testing kits are available from pharmacies if you’re keen to find out what your individual vaginal ph may be.  There is a theory that girl sperm are more prolific when a man is ejaculating daily. But just to confuse us, there is another theory which claims that it takes a couple of days for total sperm numbers to build up to maximum numbers after ejaculation.  One option is to use condoms during sex which occurs over the woman’s most fertile days. These will limit the opportunity for any conception to occur, but does support Shettles theory of a greater likelihood of boy conception at the time of ovulation .  Foods which are likely to support a more acidic vaginal ph are thought to be great for boosting the chances of having a girl.  To boost your chances of having a baby girl, try eating more of these foods:  Green leafy vegetables. Be aware that some researchers claim mothers who are keen to conceive with a girl should avoid most fruits and vegetables, though in a dietary sense this is generally not advisable for anyone. Folic acid is an important nutrient in the first trimester and green leafy vegetables are one of the major sources of folate.  Wholegrains such as breads, cereal and rice.  Meat.  Sweets, lollies, desserts and cakes. (Lucky you)!  Avoid eating nuts, specifically almonds.  Eat corn and blueberries.  Aim to eat foods which are high and rich in magnesium, such as fish, fruit and grains.  There is some science to support the theory that women who have a higher energy intake in their diets are more likely to have boys. More kilojoules per day favours those little boys it seems. So the reverse may be true to help boost the chances of having a girl. Just remember, there are no guarantees.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!

What if you already have one boy or 2 or 3 boys? Is it really a 50% chance that you will have a girl next? Let’s look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly. Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.    If you have no children, then statistically, you have a 49% chance of having a girl first.   If you have one boy, the odds of having a girl as a second child are 50%.  If you have 2 boys, the odds of having a girl as a third child are 47.7%.  If you have 3 boys, the odds of having a girl as a fourth child are 43.6%.   Odds of Having a Boy The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.  If you have no children, statistically, the odds of having a boy first are 51%.   If you have one girl, the odds of having a boy next are 54.5%.  If you have 2 girls, the odds of having a boy next are 46%.  If you have 3 girls, the odds of having a boy next are 52.7%.   Gender and Birth Order Given the information above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children. This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio. This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn’t consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   With first born children,  51.0% are Boys.  With second born children, 52.2% are Boys.  With third born children, 48.6% are Boys.  With fourth born children, 50.8% are Boys.   Odds of Having an All Same-Gender Family  If there are roughly even odds of having a boy or a girl with each baby, given the laws of chance we should still expect to see some all same-gender families, even in large families. Here is the number of all same-gender families we would expect to see, using good ole fashioned statistics:     Family Size  Same-Gender  Mixed-Gender    2 Children  50%  50%    3 Children  25%  75%    4 Children  12.5%  87.5%    5 Children  6%  94%    6 Children  3%  97%    7 Children  1.6%  98.4%     Conclusion Although we often hear from our moms, grandmothers even doctors that the chance for you to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale. It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly. If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only about 2% to 6% more likely to have another boy. If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next.

One child is a girl. What is the probability that the other child is a boy? [duplicate]         up vote  5  down vote  favorite  1       This question already has an answer here:    In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?  20 answers     My initial thought process: Sample space: GG, GB, BG, BB. I then crossed out BG because it's the same as GB because order doesn't matter here. And because we know one is a girl, there leaves two possibilities left. If the other is a boy, the probability should be 1/2, much like how they deduced it Finding probability of other child also being a boy .  However, I was told by my teacher that the answer is not 1/2 . I'm wondering if any of you guys can see a way in how the question is worded so that it's not 1/2... I don't think there's any other factors?    probability     share | cite | improve this question      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:21       Community ♦   1        asked Dec 14 '13 at 22:05       iamashortgiraffe   28 1 1 4           marked as duplicate by M Turgeon , TMM , user127.0.0.1 , T.

The sample space is (and needs to be) $\{BB, BG, GB, GG\}.$  We know one child is a girl, so that rules out BB. That leaves us with a sample space of BG, GB, GG  In which case the probability that the second child is a boy is $\dfrac 23$.   Each of the four outcomes has a probability of $\frac 14$. BG: "Having a boy, and then a girl" is a different outcome than $GB:$ having a girl, and then a boy.  To omit one of the boy-girl/girl-boy pairs leaves a sample space of three, with each outcome having probability of 13, which is not correct. Having a boy-girl pair is twice as likely as having two boys, and twice as likely as having 2 girls, and we can only obtain this by counting all four outcomes as distinct, indeed, distinguishable.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 18 '13 at 15:55             answered Dec 14 '13 at 22:07       amWhy   187k 25 215 427                  I was thinking about that, but why? You're just taking a pair of children, so whether it's BG or GB shouldn't matter because either way you're getting a girl and boy? – iamashortgiraffe  Dec 14 '13 at 22:08        1      Because each of the four outcomes has a probability of $\dfrac 14$.

If you knew that the older child was a girl, then the sample space would be simply $\{GG,GB\}$, where the older child is listed first, and the probability would indeed be $\frac12$. Similarly, if you knew that the younger child was a girl, the probability would be $\frac12$. If you knew that the taller child was a girl, it would be $\frac12$. But all you know here is that one of the children is a girl; if you list the possibilities in the order older-younger, you can rule out only $BB$. – Brian M. Scott  Dec 14 '13 at 22:15            Thanks for chiming in, @Brian. The word "distinguishable" was on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't "find" it when I was trying to explain in the comments.

If we assume that boys and girls are born with equal probability, then the probability to have two girls (and one boy) should be the same as the probability to have two boys and one girl. So you would have two cases with probability 2/3, giving an impossible 4/3 probability for both cases. – Thomas Padron-McCarthy  Jun 1 '16 at 6:48         10      Also, your list "Boy-Boy-Girl, Boy-Girl-Boy, and Girl-Boy-Boy" seems strange.

Strictly speaking, none of the answers are correct. If you make a few assumptions (some of which definitely aren't true for actual families) then you can get 3/8. The answer of 3/8 is an approximate solution, of the "assume a spherical cow" variety. – Glen_b  Jun 2 '16 at 2:26         add a comment |           8 Answers 8     active  oldest  votes            up vote  58  down vote      No, the possible outcomes are

wherein $3$ meet the requirement. There are $8$ possible outcomes, all equally likely (if we assume each gender is equally likely).  Hence the choice is $3/8$.  We can also think about it in at least one more way: 
You identified all the possible ways to get 2 boys and one girl. Since the events are disjoint, we can add up the probabilities
\begin{align*}
P(\text{2 boys, 1 girl}) &= P(\mathsf{BBG})+P(\mathsf{BGB})+P(\mathsf{GBB}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{3}{8}.

BBB, BBG, BGG, and GGG could be used as the unordered results, but the middle two would need to be weighted 3x because there are 3 ways that each outcome is possible. – Dan Neely  Jun 2 '16 at 13:41        3      @Randy: Order doesn't matter, which is why the probability of all the combinations with the same frequency distribution of each sex are added together — i.e. all those with two boys and one girl — and then divided by the the total of all possible ones. – martineau  Jun 2 '16 at 13:45             Ok I get it.

You had three permutations. They would be BBB, BBG, BGB, BGG, GBB, GBG, GGB, and GGG. Out of those, the permutations with two boys and one girl are BBG, BGB, and GBB.

So if you had a lottery ticket, it matters whether you had the right combination of numbers. Or in this case, we are asking for the number of boys and girls, rather than the order that they appeared. The Permutations do consider order, so that would be more like a code for a safe that must be done in order, or the letters in a password, or in this case the sequence of genders where BGB would be a different sequence to GBB.  So a combination is like the list of stuff at the beginning of a recipe, and the permutation is the order that you add the ingredients. You can take the same list of things and add them in different amounts and different orders, and it will likely make a big difference to the result.  Working from combinations  Just to add that you can do it via combinations, as you originally thought, but you have to take into account the relative probabilities of those combinations, which derive from the set of permutations. As we have seen from the other answers, there are 3 permutations out of 8 which contain 2 boys and a girl.  But what if we looked at the combinations instead? The combinations of 2 genders among 3 children are:   3 girls  2 girls, 1 boy  1 girl, 2 boys  3 boys   Now for the frequencies   3 girls can only be arranged 1 way, so this is a frequency of 1  2 girls, 1 boy can be rearranged, and the boy can have 3 positions (youngest, middle or oldest). Once we have the position of the boy, the girls are known, so there are 3 positions  1 girl, 2 boys: same logic as above, frequency of 3  3 boys: as with 3 girls, frequency of 1   The total of them all is 8, and the number matching our requirement is 3, giving 3/8ths.  In this question, the easiest and clearest approach was to list out the permutations and count how many matched our requirement. For larger problems, it can be simpler to either quickly collect the easy cases and then look at the permutations for a restricted set, or focus on the possible combinations. This is particularly true when there are more complex options in the construction of the set.  Edit: More on Combinations and Permutations  @WoJ has a question: why does order matter? Suppose they were triplets?  I'm not saying that the chronological order of birth is what matters, only that you have to label them. We generally write permutations as a sequence which maps to an ordering of the variables; if I flip a coin 3 times and the result is HTH then I'm implicitly saying that the sequence represents the flips ordered chronologically. But we could flip 3 coins and order them by size, or by the age of the coin; it's just a way of identifying the different flips so that we can correctly account for the possibilities.  But! You must label them before you consider how they landed . Arranging heads first then tails is already turning the result from a permutation to a combination, and making things much harder by making the result dependent on the values, when they were independent variables at the beginning. So to assess the relationship between the original tosses and the resulting combinations we have to label them first or we'll give ourselves a headache.  We can see that it is the permutations that matter rather than the combinations for random independent coin flips by doing this experiment: flip 2 coins, and if they land the same (2H or 2T), then mark 1 in the 'Same' column. If they land differently (1H 1T) then mark 1 in the 'Diff' column. If the probability is determined by the combinations, then there is only 1 combination (1H 1T) that will give a 'Diff' result, vs 2 (2H and 2T) that give a 'Same' result, and after a few rounds of flips we should see twice as many marks in the 'Diff' column. Feel free to try the experiment; run it maybe 20 times so that it is clear whether the answer is more like 2:1 or like 1:1.  I predict that the result will be 1:1, because the probability is in the coin flip, so we have to look there for the statistical basis of our calculations. The probability is 50/50 of a single independent coin flip. So the first flip (or the flip of the biggest or oldest coin) is 50/50 H or T. Now, given that the first flip was a Head, what will the second be? These are independent coin flips, so the chances are still 50/50. This gives us a second value. Since these are independent flips, we label them differently and draw up either a table of their values, or a list of the permutations:  First
         H    T
2nd  H  0.25 0.25
     T  0.25 0.25  Now we can look at the categorisation of these permutations as combinations:  H       T
 H    2H     1H 1T
 T   1H 1T    2T  So although there are 3 labelled combinations (2H, 2T, 1H 1T), they are not evenly spread among the permutations (HH, TT, HT, TH), and we have already said that in this case the probability is being driven by the permutations, not the combinations. So to correctly account for the probabilities assigned to those combinations, we have to start from the permutations and see how they map to combinations; 2 go to becoming '1H 1T', and one each to '2H' and '2T'. How do they then map to the categories of 'Same' and 'Diff'?  H    T            1H 1T  Diff  = 0.25+0.25
 H   Same Diff   or    2H     Same  = 0.25
 T   Diff Same         2T     Same  = 0.25  And thus we have P(Same) = 0.25+0.25 = 0.5 and P(Diff) = 0.25+0.25 = 0.5.  At no point have we cared how we ordered the coins, only that we could identify them separately because they have independent probabilities assigned to their flips.  Are there cases where you can't get the answer by just looking at the permutations? Yes, absolutely. For example, the permutations are not always neatly equally likely as we have in these constructed problems. The possible colours of socks in my drawer might be Yellow, Green and Black, but I have a lot more Black socks because the world doesn't share my fascination with Green yet. If we looked at the permutations of 2 socks picked from the drawer, we would get YY, YG, YB, GY, GG, GB, BY, BG, BB. If we just naively looked at the permutations we might imagine the chance of getting a matched pair was 3/9, or 1/3. But it is not, because there are a lot more black socks.  We might instead have a lottery ticket, which only matters what the combination is; then looking at the permutations would be a fruitless exercise, as the drawing process enforces the relationship between probability and combination rather than permutation.  Triplets by combination  Do demonstrate the problems of arranging the triplet birth result into combinations before applying the probabilities, let's actually calculate it that way around. We flip 3 coins, and ignoring the chronology arrange them with heads first. The possible results are HHH, HHT, HTT, TTT. 4 combinations.  But how can we apply our probability that each birth is 50/50? By rearranging the order, we are breaking the mapping between an individual birth and the item in the combination; you can see that straight away in that the only way the first coin in our rearranged set can be a T is if all 3 coins came up T, and we know intuitively that that's much less likely than the probability for any given toss being T. Can we still do it? Well, yes, but it's tricky.  The first combination is HHH. What is the chance of throwing HHH? The flips are independent, and these coins can be rearranged however you like, but it will always have to be 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.125. So immediately the HHH combination has a chance of 0.125 instead of 0.25. Just because we have 4 categories, doesn't mean the probability relates to that number in any way.  The same argument applies for TTT. So now we have accounted for 0.25 of the probability out of half the combinations.  What of HHT and HTT? Well, since the chances of H and T are equal, we could relabel H as T and T as H, or call the sides A and B without any loss of generality, so the probabilities must be equal here too; both combinations are 2 of one and 1 of the other. So the remaining 6/8 of the probability give us 3/8 for each option.  What if H and T were not interchangeable? Suppose P(H) was 3/5, not 1/2? We can see that the combinations don't give us a straight answer because they are unchanged (3H, 2H, 1H, 0H) but we know intuitively that the chances of getting 2H must depend on the bias of the coin flip. Here we would have a remaining probability of 1 - 0.4*0.4*0.4 - 0.6*0.6*0.6 = 0.72. The two remaining combinations are HTT and HHT. So we know that the first and last of those coins came out the same, and this is the set of tosses which contain one head and one tail. Removing that head and tail leaves the outcome of a single coin. It doesn't matter which order the coins were tossed in, or even how we reordered them afterwards. The final coin has P(H)=0.6 and P(T)=0.4, so P(H)/P(T) = 1.5. We already have the other two coins, so we have P(2H 1T)/P(1H 2T) = 1.5. Distributing the remaining probability of 0.72 gives us P(2H 1T)+P(1H 2T)=0.72, and we can then substitute to get P(2H 1T)+P(2H 1T)/1.5=0.72, so P(2H 1T)=0.432.  By contrast, to calculate that from the original tosses, we have:  P(2H,1T) = P(HHT)+P(HTH)+P(THH) 
         = .6*.6*.4 + .6*.4*.6 + .4*.6*.6
         = 0.144 * 3 = 0.432  So if we have independent variables (births, coin tosses), it is easiest to look at the permutations and collect the probabilities of the permutations we want than to start from the combinations and work backwards to figure out how their probabilities relate to the individual variable probabilities. But it is not impossible, and in some cases preferable.  TLDR: The important thing is to look at the mechanism by which randomness appears in the system, and to then measure the probabilities from there either in terms of combinations or permutations, but not blindly applying either as the method entirely depends on the mechanism of the randomness. Both approaches can be made to work, but only if you correctly account for the probabilities according to the system you are considering.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 3 '16 at 13:20             answered Jun 1 '16 at 10:05       Phil H   883 1 5 12                  I have a hard time understanding why the order needs to be taken into account at all.

Basically, it's not about chronology but about labelling so that we can apply the probability we know about (that each birth is 50/50 boy or girl). By arranging the results into combinations, you have already skipped the step of relating the individual birth probabilities to permutation probabilities, and thus are not accounting for the given probabilities correctly. If that isn't clear, let me know. – Phil H  Jun 3 '16 at 11:39            I like the idea of having him do a simulation by coin flipping!   A couple hundred trials should be enough to distinguish between 3/8 and 1/3. I wonder if this would be permitted on the exam...  It is almost like cheating.

Then we loop through all combinations, for example by incrementing by 1  each step.$$000\to001\to010\to011\to100\to 101\to110\to111$$  We then count the total number of "ones" equals 2. This is the same as the "population count" function used in this question and answer .  The output of the function would be:
$$0\to1\to1\to2\to1\to2\to2\to3$$  And as we can see, for 3 of the 8 states the function evaluates to 2. This means that after counting all possibilities, we found that 3 of the 8 equiprobable states correspond to two boys. This gives a probability of $\frac{3}{8}$.

They have two kids. One of them is a girl. What
  is the probability that the other kid is also a girl?   This is a classical problem in probability. What makes this question confusing is the fact that the question is ambiguous since there may be no such thing as "the other kid".  Suppose a couple has two children, call then $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$. When you say "one of them is a girl" two possible interpretations are:  #1 Someone told me the couple has at least one girl but I don't know if both children are girls, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl, or if $\mathcal{Y}$ is a girl; the possible cases are GG, GB, BG. I want to compute the probability that both of the couple's children are girls (GG).  or  #2 Someone told me $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl but I don't know if $\mathcal{Y}$ is a boy or a girl; the possible cases are GG, GB. I want to compute the probability that $\mathcal{Y}$ is also a girl (GG).  Now, you can answer each of these questions using, for example, expressions for conditional probabilities (the answers to interpretations #1 and #2 are 1/3 and 1/2, respectively). However, if you are left with a feeling of "sure, I see how you can obtain that result but why isn't my answer correct?" read on.   Interpretation #1:  (This is the one I find interestingly confusing.)  When you first think about the problem you might use the following ( incorrect ) reasoning:   I know at least one of the children is a girl, what is the probability
  that the other child (the child of unknown gender) is also a girl? well,
  shouldn't it be 1/2? I mean, the other child can be a boy or a girl regardless ... right?   One of the problems with this reasoning is that there is no such thing as " the child of unknown gender " (therefore, there is no such thing as " the other child "). In fact, you do not know either of the children's genders (in this interpretation both children have unknown gender!). All you know is that there is a girl in there somewhere, but you do not know which of the two children is the girl. How can you hope to compute the probability that the other child (the child of unknown gender) is a girl if there is no such thing as "the child of unknown gender"? In fact, if you happen to know that $\mathcal{X}$ (or $\mathcal{Y}$) is a girl then you are using a different interpretation of the question (interpretation #2).  The other problem with this reasoning is related to independence. As people have pointed out, given the added overarching assumption that there is at least one girl, "$\mathcal{X}$'s gender" and "$\mathcal{Y}$'s gender" are not independent random variables. This is easy to see since, for example, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a boy then $\mathcal{Y}$ is forced to be a girl with probability 1 (not 1/2). This lack of independence is the reason why you can't say that one of the two children is a boy or girl independently/regardless of the other.  Formal Derivation of Answer to Interpretation #1:  Using the formula for conditional probabilities we have
\begin{align*}
P\big(\text{Both are Girls } \big| \text{ At Least One Girl}\big)&=\frac{P\Big(\big(\text{Both are Girls}\big)\cap\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)\Big)}{P\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)}\\
&=\frac{P\big(\text{Both are Girls}\big)}{P\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)}\\
&= \frac{1/4}{3/4}=\frac{1}{3}.
\end{align*}   Interpretation #2:  I don't think there is anything confusing about this interpretation. You know the $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl and $\mathcal{Y}$ can be a girl or a boy independently of $\mathcal{X}$. In this case, the random variables "$\mathcal{X}$'s gender" and "$\mathcal{Y}$'s gender" are not linked by any added overarching assumption and are independent.  Formal Derivation of Answer to Interpretation #2:  Using the independence of the second child's gender relative to the first child's gender:  \begin{align*}
P\big(\text{Second is a Girl } \big| {\text{ First is a Girl}}\big)=P\big(\text{Second is a Girl}\big)=\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}   Regarding the second question:   Now A and B have 4 children and all of them are boys. B is pregnant.
  So what is the probability that A and B are gifted with a baby girl?
  Is it 1/2 or there will be some conditional probability?   The answer is that the next child's gender is independent of the first four children's genders (by assumption), this is because there is no added overarching assumption involving the next child. The answer is then simply $1/2$. (This is just like in Interpretation #2.)     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Aug 10 '17 at 17:41             answered May 26 '16 at 19:48       Karla H.   503 1 10                  +1 Thanks for the lovely answer to an often asked question.

While I've known the mathematical answer to this problem and have been familiar with the ambiguity of the question for a while, I had always struggled to explain (without math) why the incorrect reasoning was incorrect. In my head the answer was often just "that's not how probability works". I'm glad to have come up with a semi-satisfying non-math-based explanation. – Karla H.  Jun 5 '16 at 18:50            i dont see how is this reliable? i know the answer is right but P(A/B) is calculated only if A and B are dependent, how the events of giving birth of two babies are affecting eachother conditionally ?if someone roll a dice and makes 6, the second toss would never depend on the first. – Abra001  Jun 5 '16 at 19:54             First: you can compute P(A|B) regardless of whether A and B are dependent or not.  Second: You are almost right, without other assumptions two babies can be assumed to have independent gender. However, in this case you are adding another assumption : you can't have two boys. Originally the babies genders are independent but once you start adding assumptions like "you can't have two boys" or "the second baby has to have different gender than the first baby" then the genders can become dependent random variables. – Karla H.

In this case, $A$ is the event that the other kid is a girl, and $B$ is the event that one of the kids is a girl.  $A\cap B$ would be both kids are girls, which has a probability of $\frac14$.  $B$ would be the event that one of the kids is a girl, which has a probability of $\frac34$.  Therefore, the required probability is $\frac{1/4}{3/4}=\frac13$.   And for the second question, we can do it using conditional probability or without.  Using conditional probability:  $A$ be the event that the fifth child is a girl.  $B$ be the event that the first four children are boys.  $P(A\cap B)$ would be $\left(\frac12\right)^5=\frac1{32}$.  $P(B)$ would be $\left(\frac12\right)^4=\frac1{16}$.  The required probability would be $\frac{1/32}{1/16}=\frac12$.  Without using conditional probability:  Notice that event $A$ is independent on event $B$.  Therefore, $P(A)=\frac12$.   Notes  In the first question, the probability in question is the probability that "the other kid is also a girl", making the two events dependent.  However, in the second question, the word other is gone, leaving us with independent events.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 26 '16 at 10:56             answered May 26 '16 at 10:45       Kenny Lau   13.9k 20 44                  and for the second question? – Hailey  May 26 '16 at 10:46        add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Originally there are $4$ equiprobable possibilities: BB,GB,GG,BG.

This is an example where we need to be extra careful using ordinary language to express what we mean mathematically.  Does it mean :   One specific kid is a girl ( for example first born ).  Any one of the two kids is a girl.  Exactly one of the kids is a girl (thanks to drhab's comment)   For 1 we only have the freedom left to consider two cases girl & boy which should be an equi-probable independent event. That is: probability $1/2$.  For 2 it is like sampling one of the letters $\{BB, BG, GB, GG\}$, noticing that it is a $G$ and then wondering what the other would be. As you can see there is only one G which has another G besides it but three which have any 1 G, so here the probability it would be $1/3$.  For 3 it could be if a parent says "I have two children of which one is a girl" it probably is assumed that only one of the kids is a girl and then the probability of second kid to be a girl would be 0.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 27 '16 at 11:41             answered May 26 '16 at 20:49       mathreadler   12.9k 7 17 54              1      There is even a third possibility: one of the kids is a girl could also mean exactly one of the kids is a girl .

Suppose there is a birthday party to which all of the girls (and none of the boys) in a small town are invited. If you run into a mother who has dropped off a kid at this birthday party and who has two children, the chance that she has two girls is $1/3$. Why? $3/4$ of the mothers with two children will have a daughter at the birthday party, the ones with two girls ($1/4$ of the total mothers with two children) and the ones with one girl and one boy ($1/2$ of the total mothers with two children). Out of these $3/4$ of the mothers, $1/3$ have two girls.  On the other hand, if the birthday party is only for fifth-grade girls, you get a different answer. Assuming there are no siblings who are both in the fifth grade, the answer in this case is $1/2$. The child in fifth grade is a girl, but the other child has probability $1/2$ of being a girl. Situations of this kind arise in real life much more commonly than situations of the other kind, so the answer of $1/3$ is quite nonintuitive.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '10 at 1:54             answered Dec 23 '10 at 1:05       Peter Shor   2,466 14 22              add a comment |             up vote  60  down vote      In a family with 2 children there are four possibilities:  1) the first child is a boy and the second child is a boy (bb)  2) the first child is a boy and the second child is a girl (bg)  3) the first child is a girl and the second child is a boy (gb)  4) the first child is a girl and the second child is a girl (gg)  Since we are given that at least one child is a girl there are three possibilities: bg, gb, or gg.

Of course this is not unique to English, and I think you should be able to find similar similar puzzles in pretty much any natural language.  Here is an example that brings out the difficulty more clearly.  First, consider the following similar puzzle:   A family has two children, Robin and Lindsay. Lindsay is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   In elementary probability class, they teach you to answer this by making a table of the four options  Robin    Lindsay
  B        B
* B        G
  G        B
* G        G  The starred rows are the ones where Lindsay is a girl, and we compute from them that the chance that both children are girls is 1/2.  Now consider this puzzle   A family has two children, Robin and Lindsay. At least one of them is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   The elementary probability method gives the following table, and a probability of 1/3.  The difference is that we gain one more row, compared to the previous puzzle.  Robin    Lindsay
  B        B
* B        G
* G        B
* G        G  After looking at these, you can see that the difficulty of the original puzzle comes because, in English, "one of the children" can mean several different things:   "one" can mean "a particular one". If you read the original puzzle like this, it becomes analogous to the first puzzle I wrote, and the answer will be 1/2.  "one" can mean "at least one". If you read the original puzzle like this, it become analogous to the second puzzle I wrote, and the answer is 1/3.  "one" can mean "exactly one". If you read the original puzzle like this, the answer is 0.   There is a common convention in mathematics that "one" usually means "at least one". For example, this is the sense intended in the following sentence, which is a typical example of mathematical English: "if a natural number $n$ is a multiple of a prime number $p$, and $n = ab$, then one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by $p$."  We would not read this as saying that exactly one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by $p$.  I don't believe this convention is very common in non-mathematical English. If I say, "one of my children is a girl", in normal English this means that the other is a boy. Similar discrepancies between mathematical and non-mathematical English come up with our use of the word "or" and our use of the phrase "if/then".  When we teach mathematics, we have to spend time explaining this mathematical argot to students, so they can use the same English conventions that we do.  Probability puzzles like the one you're asking about rely on these differences of English meaning, rather than on any logical or mathematical problem.  In that sense, they aren't really puzzles, they're just tricks.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 23 '10 at 15:47       Carl Mummert   61.2k 7 116 227                  I now, at last, agree that the correct answer is 1/3.

It's long, but bear with me - after reading this answer, you should feel intuitively-comfortable with almost all other probabilistic fallacies, not just this one.  The first and most important thing is to define what we mean by "probability."  Let's define it to mean "the expected percentage of positive outcomes when repeating an observation over a large sample"  (Go ahead, read that again, more slowly) .  Also, let's call the method we use to chose this large sample the "model."  This may sound trivial, but it has some important implications.  For example, what is the probability you will die before age 40?  According to our definition, this question has no meaning:  we can't observe you multiple times before age forty and record how many times you die.  Instead, we observe other people below age 40, and record how many of them die.  So let's say we observe all other people on earth below age 40 (our model), and find that 1/2 of them die before hitting the big four-oh.  Does this mean the probability of you dying before 40 is 50%?  Well, according to this model, it does!  However, this is hardly a fair model.  Perhaps you live in a first-world country - now when we revise our model to include only people below 40 in first-world countries, your chances become a much-less-grim 1/10 † .  But you are also not a smoker, and don't live in the city, and ride your bike on Sundays with your wife and crazy mother-in-law, which makes your chances 123/4567!  That's much better... however, our model still doesn't take into account that you are also an avid skydiver ;)  † I am pulling these numbers out of nowhere, they are not real statistics.  So the point is, asking for a "probability" only makes sense in the context of a certain model - a way of repeating our observation many times.  Without that, asking for a probability is meaningless.   Now, back to the original question.  Before we can assign a probability, we must choose a model; how are we choosing the families to sample from?  I see two obvious choices, which will lead to different answers:   Consider only families which have two children, one of whom is a girl, and choose one randomly.  Consider only girls who have exactly one sibling, and choose one randomly.   Do you see the difference?  In the first case, every family has the same probability of being chosen.  However, in the second case, the families with two girls are more likely to be chosen than families with only one girl, because every girl has an equal chance of being chosen:  the two-girl families have doubled their odds by having two girls.  If children were raffle tickets, they would have bought two tickets while the one-girl families bought only one.  Thus, we should expect the probabilities in these two cases to be different.  Let's calculate them more rigorously (writing BG to mean "boy was born, then girl):   There are three equally probable family-types: BG , GB , and GG  ( BB was removed from consideration, because they have no girls) .  Since only one of the three has two girls, our chances of having two girls are 1/3 .  We have the same possibilities as above, but now GG is twice as likely as BG or GB .  Thus, the probabilities are GG: 2/4 , GB: 1/4 , and BG: 1/4 , meaning the probability of a girl-sibling is 2/4 = 1/2  (alternatively, we could have noted that there are only two equally-probable possibilities for the sibling:  boy or girl) .   Here lies the fallacy:  the model our intuition assumes is the second one, but the way the problem is worded strongly implies the first one.  When we think in terms of "randomly choosing a family (over a large number of families)," our intuition meshes perfectly with the result.   Let's take a look at another similar problem   In a family of two children, where the oldest child is a girl, what is the probability they are both girls?   Once again, I can see two different, plausible models for observing our random sample:   Consider only families with two children, the oldest of whom is a girl, and choose one randomly.  Consider only girls who have exactly one (younger) sibling, and choose one at random.   So once again, the question strongly implies the first model, though arguments for either could be made.  However, when we actually calculate the probability...   Same as before, but we've also eliminated BG , where the first child was a boy.  This leaves only two equally-probable possibilities, GB and GG .  Thus, the chances are 1/2 .  We've also eliminated BG from this case, leaving GB and GG .  However, unlike the original question, GG is no longer twice as likely, since the younger child can no longer be the one who was randomly chosen.  Thus, GB and GG are equally likely, and we again have a probability of 1/2  (alternatively, we could have noted that there are only two equally-probable possibilities for the sibling:  boy or girl) .   ...we find that the choice between these two models doesn't matter, because in this case both have the same probability!  Among two-child families with an older daughter, it doesn't matter if we randomly choose the family or the older-daughter, because in both cases there is only one of each per family.   Hopefully that all made sense.  For bonus points, try applying this reasoning to the Monty Hall problem.  What is our model - how are we making repeated observations?  Why does it clash with our intuition?  For even more bonus points, try to figure out the following question; the math isn't too difficult, but it took me a long while to figure out why, intuitively, the answer should be correct:   In a family of two children, one of whom is a girl named Florida, what are the chances of two girls?

Mathematically, there is no problem at all. Once we list the possible events and the favorable events, the probability is just the corresponding fraction. So the difficulty in these puzzles is just that English hasn't evolved a clear way to describe a probability space. There are two reasonable probability spaces here, and usual English is not clear about which of them is intended. But regardless what anyone knows about the children, I can still compute the probabilities in both these spaces, to get 1/3 and 1/2, respectively. – Carl Mummert  Dec 23 '10 at 15:06             @Carl: Then you must believe that the Monty Hall problem is ambiguous in exactly the same way, no?  I'm afraid I have to disagree with that. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Dec 23 '10 at 17:15         2      I do feel that the difficulty in the Monty Hall problem is also not "mathematical", in the sense that as soon as any probability model has been rigorously stated then the probabilities can be calculated using basic methods. The arguments about the Monty Hall problem stem from a lack of rigour in the statement, which I think is often intentional in order to make an otherwise easy probability exercise into a "puzzle". – Carl Mummert  Dec 23 '10 at 17:44            @Carl: In both cases, it's not that it's ambiguous or not mathematically-defined, it's just counter-intuitive. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Dec 23 '10 at 21:29        2      The two puzzles are similar, and you've made a nice comparison.  They each have two simple probability models, and it's clear which gives the clever, counter-intuitive solution.  But if you admit any more complexity, there's a lot of ambiguity in both problems.  For example, given a room full of people convinced that switching doors is the right strategy, an adversarial Monty Hall can make sure no one wins by offering the switch only to those who first choose the car.  In real life, I would assume ratings and TV gimmicks affect what choices I'm given, and I have no probability model for that! – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 23 '10 at 23:04        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  10  down vote      Here's some idea.  Suppose you sample $4n$ families with two children, where $n$ is a very large integer. Then, with a very high probability, about $n$ of them have two boys, about $n$ have two girls, and about $2n$ have one girl and one boy.
Since you ignore the families with two boys, the desired probability is given by $n/(3n) = 1/3$.  EDIT: The above solution corresponds to the following situation. You visit a large number of families. In each family, you check if there are two kids. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you check if one of the kids is a girl. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you check if both kids are girls.  EDIT: Among all the OP's examples, only one is relevant here. Namely, "I visit this family. I know they have 2 kids. One of them, a girl, comes into the room. The probability that the 2nd kid is also a girl is 1/2, no?". Well, in this situation the probability is indeed $1/2$, assuming the following interpretation. You visit a large number of families. In each family, you check if there are two kids. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you wait until one of the kids comes into the room. If it is a boy, you ignore this family; otherwise you check if both kids are girls. It is readily understood that this leads to a probability of $1/2$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 21 '10 at 13:52             answered Dec 21 '10 at 12:47       Shai Covo   20.7k 1 27 52              4      Of course, a lot depends on how we interpret the question. – Shai Covo  Dec 21 '10 at 12:52        1      @NotSuper: It all depends a lot on the precise formulation, as Shai already pointed out.

(The original question is a little ambiguous, but I agree that 1/3 is the best answer.)  The marble example and the example of the firstborn daughter are the same situation-- the second trial is independent, and the odds are 1/2.  In these cases you know the first trial is independent, and you can ignore it.  The original question intends you to imagine a randomly chosen 2 child family from among all families with at least 1 daughter.  For example, suppose there is a social science study on 2 child families with at least 1 daughter-- in this situation, about 1/3 of the families will be daughter-daughter, 1/3 will be daughter-son, and 1/3 will be son-daughter.  You have to consider the full probability space of two trials (d-d,d-s,s-d,s-s) and eliminate the s-s possibility.  This leaves a 1/3 chance of 2 daughters.  For other variations on this question, you have to decide the appropriate probability space before answering.  (One common, confusing variation is to suppose the family has two children, one of which is a son born on a Tuesday-- what are the odds of two sons?)  In your example where the first child in the room is a daughter, if we suppose that the order the children enter has nothing to do with sex, then the probability the other child is a daughter is 1/2.  However, maybe the family encourages their daughters to play inside and their sons outside-- then you could assume the other child is a son, since he hasn't come in yet.  Maybe the culture has a tradition that the oldest daughter in the household (if there is a daughter) offers guests drinks-- then you know the family has at least one daughter, and the odds that they have another daughter is 1/3.  Once you've chosen your assumptions, you can define the probability space and compute the answer.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 21 '10 at 14:03       Jonas Kibelbek   5,049 1 21 28              1      @Jonas  It isn't at all clear that "The original question intends you to imagine a randomly chosen 2 child family from among all families with at least 1 daughter." Instead I imagined I hadn't seen my nephew in a decade, and we hadn't kept in touch. But I had heard that he had 2 kids and one was a girl. I was going to visit him soon and was wondering about the other child. Girl? or boy? I figured the chances of a girl was 1 in 2, and I still do. I found the Wikipedia article linked to by Rawling enlightening. – NotSuper  Dec 21 '10 at 15:15             @NotSuper: Yes, I agree it's ambiguous.  It is clear that I gave Mlodinow's intended interpretation only because he gave the answer 1/3.  But your nephew scenario is ambiguous as well-- how did you hear that one child is a girl?  You could learn that among their children is at least one daughter (maybe they send an old dollhouse to your grandchildren), which gives 1/3.  Or, you could specify one of their children (oldest, first to answer the phone, etc., as long as it's independent of sex) and learn she is a girl, which gives 1/2. – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 21 '10 at 15:42            These correspond to the two probability spaces described in my answer and in the Wikipedia article.  When you hear that one child is a girl, can you cross off son-son and son-daughter, or can you just cross off son-son?  (With other information and messier probability models, we could get other answers than 1/2 and 1/3 as well.  But these are the two most sensible models to apply.) – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 21 '10 at 15:46             @Jonas "How did you hear that one child is a girl?" I wrote "I had heard that he had 2 kids and one was a girl." I think that implies that someone told me that (or possibly wrote that to me in a letter or email), and that's all I know about my nephew's children. Isn't that the standard interpretation? – NotSuper  Dec 24 '10 at 13:34             @NotSuper: To quote from Carl's answer, "one child" can be interpreted several ways in English: "one particular child," "at least one child," or "exactly one child."  If the letter or e-mail gives you enough context to pick one interpretation, then it's easy to compute the probability.  Your intuitive answer of 1/2 is a correct answer, provided you recognize you are using the "one particular child" interpretation.  But, since this is a puzzle or riddle, the smallest assumption ("at least one child"), which gives the counter-intuitive answer, is the riddler's preferred answer.  Do you agree? – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 24 '10 at 16:34        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  2  down vote      This is really a continuation of BlueRaja's answer, where I'm changing the question slightly to give another illustration of the underlying point.  Consider the following two procedures:  Procedure A: I flip two coins, a nickel and a penny.  After the flip, I
pick one at random, and report its value to you.  Procedure B: I flip two coins, a nickel and a penny.  If exactly one lands
heads, I report that one's value to you, i.e. I say either "the nickel
landed heads" or "the penny landed heads" as appropriate.  If both land
heads, I report on one of them chosen at random.  If neither lands
heads, I say "both landed tails."  Now, if I follow Procedure A and say "the nickel landed
heads", then the probability that the penny landed heads is 50/50.  But
if I say the very same thing after following Procedure B, the
probability that the penny landed heads is 1 in 3.  Now take the following problem:  I flip two coins and say to you "the
nickel landed heads".  What is the probability that the penny landed
heads? Clearly there's no way to answer without knowing or assuming something about the procedure I'm following.  (All this having been said, I agree that the best answer to the original question is 1/3.)     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 22 '10 at 22:47       Larry Denenberg   656 3 10              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?  0%.

In this case we are given that one or both of the children is a girl, but not given any information about which one(s) -- so a simple evaluation of the 4 possible scenarios (for a two-child family) reveals the answer of 33%.  The confusion stems from the slightly ambiguous language used.  The phrase one of the children was used to mean one or both of the children .  Based on that language, our brains trick us into thinking that a specific  one of the children is given and therefore we can evaluate the other child independently.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 6 '13 at 4:24       nobar   101 2                  A link to this Wikipedia article was given in the main comments, but I wanted to point out that the article addresses the psychology of this problem , in an attempt to expose the seeming "paradox" of common intuition. – nobar  May 13 '13 at 2:20             youtu.be/be2wuOaglFY?t=37m0s "This problem is famous for being ill-posed." – nobar  Mar 3 '17 at 1:43            There is some ambiguity about whether I should have said "4 possible scenarios" or "3 possible scenarios". – nobar  Mar 3 '17 at 1:46        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Let $X$ be the event "one of the children is a girl" Let $BG$ refer to the event the family has one boy and one girl (I'm not distinguishing $BG$ and $GB$), and so forth. Everything is conditioned on the family having two children.  $$ P(GG | X) = \frac{P(GG \wedge X)}{P(X)} 
= \frac{P(X|GG) P(GG)}{P(X|GG) P(GG) + P(X|BG)P(BG) + P(X|BB)P(BB)}

1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + P(X|BG) \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}}
= \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot P(X|BG)}
$$  (note that I am assuming this isn't taken as a "trick" question, so that $P(X|GG) = 1$ is meant, rather than $P(X|GG)=0$)  So everything boils down to the probability of "one of the children is a girl" given that the family has a boy and a girl.  Now, what does the phrase "one of the children is a girl" mean? There are two typical options   This phrase simply means that this is not an all-boy family. In this case, $P(X|BG) = 1$, and $P(GG|X) = 1/3$.  The phrase means that a particular child was chosen and it could just has easily have been the boy, so that $P(X|BG) = 1/2$, and $P(GG|X) = 1/2$.   In my opinion, an English speaker would almost always interpret the phrase the first way rather than the second way.  However, there is a nasty linguistic trap: even meaning it the first way, we may often pick a girl to be the referent of "one" (e.g. so that we can speak of the "other" child). And since we've picked a girl, we get stuck in the second interpretation. This is exacerbated by the fact the second interpretation has a very appealing shortcut for reasoning out the solution.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 17 '15 at 3:51             answered Oct 17 '15 at 3:37       Hurkyl   102k 8 100 237              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      You have to read carefully.

girl".  Two of them lead to the 1/2 and 1/3 answers which have been discussed
at length, but I found only one brief
answer covering the third
interpretation (though I did only skim).  The meaning of the statement, and consequently the correct answer, can be
altered by considering it to answer different questions.   "How many of your children are girls?"  "One of my children is a girl."  "Is one of your children a girl?"  "Yes, one of my children is a girl."  "Is the child in the stroller a boy or a girl?"  "This one is a girl."   Suppose you've just had the first discussion; what do you think the other child
will be in that case?  There is no chance the other is a girl.  The second question would prompt most people to search their set of children
for a girl and answer "yes" if they can find one or "no" otherwise.
Consequently, out of the 3/4 of two-child parents who can answer yes, about 1/3
of those will have another girl.  However it's conceivable that some kind of contrarian may resolve "one of your
children" even before they have considered the rest of the question, choosing
one at random regardless of its gender, and answering the rest of the question
with respect to that random choice.  This renders the situation equivalent to
the third case.  In the third case, obviously, the gender of the other child is independent of
all the information we have.  So it's a 1/2 chance.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:20       Community ♦   1        answered Feb 22 '17 at 18:54       sh1   117 2                  This is entirely incorrect.

I set $q=P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \mbox{He has $\{B,G\}$})$.  If you sample at family level, then you ask the father if he has at least a daughter or you check official records. In that case $q=1$.  If you sample at child level, by for instance meeting the father in the company of one child or otherwise happening to find out about one child, then $q=1/2$. In this case you will half the time miss this family because you happen to see the son first.  Using Bayes' formula, we get
$$
P(\{B,G\}) \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})
= \frac{P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{B,G\}) P(\{B,G\})}
{P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})}.
$$  Since
$$P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter}) = P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{B,G\}) P(\{B,G\}) + P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{G, G\}) P(\{G, G\}),
$$  we get 
$$
P(\{B,G\} \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter}) = (q \times 1/2)/(q \times 1/2 + 1 \times 1/4) = 2q/(1 + 2q),
$$  and it follows that 
$$
P(\{G, G\} \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})=1/(1 + 2q).
$$  If $q=1/2$, we get $P=1/2$, and $q=1$ gives $P=1/3$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 2 '17 at 18:23       Helmer.Aslaksen   21 2              add a comment |             up vote  -2  down vote      Ok let us consider the unknown. A couple has a girl child. The wife gets pregnant. What are the odds the second child will be a (girl) or (boy).  Now we have reduced the question to a single possibility set.
 the child will have x-x chromosomes
 The child will have x-y Chromosomes  The wife ONLY provides X chromosomes. The husband has the coin toss x or y.
As there is ONLY one coin being thrown (the second x or y in our fair coin toss) then the odds remain 50%. We are NOT Throwing two fair coins to find an answer in this case.  Given a fair coin, the odds are 50% of either outcome, period. We can now use this theory regardless of anything else when asking about the next occurrence (or unknown previous occurrence) as it is separate from any other occurrence and not related in any way. There are TWO options only.  You can stack all the "possibilities and probabilities" you want to, however we KNOW that given a coin toss the next toss has a 50% chance of either outcome. IT is ONLY in looking backward at "n" tosses and in the ORDER of results that any other probability exists and that does not apply to the next toss itself. Having tossed three Y's consecutively does not increase the odds of an X on the next toss, nor reduce it.  Where the first toss is unknown (the second child is a girl) then it still makes no difference...there is an xx, xy possibility genetically as to the first toss. Therefore 50% chance. Ignore english completely...look at the basic problem, unless you care about order or statistics of results over "n" tosses etc.  The ONLY way that one ever has a statistic of 
gg
gb
bg
bb  is when a fair coin is tossed n times and actually create the "expected" result given above. It is not possible to change the odds of "next throw" of a fair coin(s). Only to look backward to the odds that a specific result might be expected over n tosses in a specific order or not. We only have ONE toss involved (next or unknown previous toss) then there is only one possible answer, a 50% chance an x or y chromosome exists.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 26 '16 at 22:55       Djea3   1              add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      It's 1/2 as order is not important, just the physical combination.  i.e. BG == GB.

I dont see any ambiguity with this question. Clearly, the OP, didnt specify the position of the first girl. Even if the OP, asked "...if the Eldest is a girl, that both children are girls?" and we have to include the 'order' of the genders in determining the probability of the 2nd child the answer is still 1/2.  General basis...that there's a 50% chance that the 2nd child is either a boy or a girl(gender is an independent event). Therefore, (ignoring reality that the ratio of boys and girls is skewed in favor of girls) its distribution within a population (multiple events) is equally, half boys and half girls, for the second child.  Proof of this is by looking at genetics. Males, carries the xy chromosomes and xx for the females.  A child can be either xx or xy.  In a family of 2 children then the distribution of chromosomes would be the following combination...  xx xx (all girls) xy xy (all boys) xx xy (a girl and a boy)  *note the 3rd combination, it's not order specific, which also represent the combination xy xx  It's given that one child is a girl therefore we can remove the combination xy xy. We end up with only 2 combination, one of the combination is xx xx (all girls) therefore the chance of that happening is 1/2.  If we have to be specific with the gender order then our combination would be...  xx xx xy xy xx xy xy xx  and "...if the Eldest is a girl..."  a) one child is a girl therefore we can remove the xy xy combination  b) eldest is a girl therefore we can remove the xy xx combination (boy is older)  which leaves us with the following combination....  xx xy xx xx  clearly 1/2  Why 1/3 is wrong...  The original assumption is that there are 4 combinations as oppose to 3. The 4 combinations only applies if the order is specified either the eldest or the youngest.  If the known girl is the eldest then the combination BG has to be excluded for consideration.  If the known girl is the youngest then the combination GB has to be excluded for consideration.  The 1/3 proponent assume that there is no order and represented the boy and girl combination both ways instead of one. Or, there is order but neglected to remove the combination that doesnt represent the actual position of the known girl.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 21 '13 at 8:30             answered Dec 21 '13 at 8:22       nick   1 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

These are the statistics of the likelihood of having one gender over another after studying over 6,000 families that have over 12,000 children between them. This a more thorough study than most the ones I see on much more important issues (like circumcising or delayed vaccinations) so I thought it was pretty cool.  If anyone was confused and thinks you should start painting the nursery after reading these statistics, that's not true!! They are just the odds that other families have shown.  I think it is really interesting that families of 1, 3, or 4+ girls has a greater than 50% chance of having a boy, but with a family with 2 girls, the chance of a boy is slightly lower than 50%. Statistics are interesting not the rule    --  **Alyssa** Rockin' Mom to  Julia  (3.13.04) and Maribel  (3.06.08) and  TTC Our Last Punk              Reply            Report this comment       0               / 2      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

Policebaby#3    Last edited 02/17/2014        What are the odds of having all children of the same sex?  And when I ask this, I mean 3 or more.  I think the odds are astronomical to have all of your children the same sex when it comes to 3 or more.  It is a theory I have and was curious to what others thought.  If you think about it, you have a 50/50 shot.  I know of people who have 5 boys, some who have 4 girls..I find it hard to believe that 50/50 shot deal because how can you have that luck each and every time that you produce only boys or only girls?  I honestly think there could be a possibility that some men cannot produce the opposite sex sperm (X or Y) or that the woman's body kills off the opposite sex sperm.  I am sure this is hogwash, but it gets me thinking.  My friend has all girls, 3.  My uncle has 2 boys from a prior marriage and now 2 boys from his new marriage.  I know XY sperm (boy) swim faster and if you time it just right they will get their first and it could just happen the deed is done right at the time they will get to the egg but this would have had to have been done each time....however I just think the odds are very high.  I honestly thought I my body rejected female sperm until I got pregnant with a girl this time but I know many people who have a few children or more and they are all boys or all girls.  Any thoughts on this or am I just bored and thinking too deep about it?  Be honest I would love to hear other thoughts on this.  It is always something that intrigued me.

With any given preg., the odds are 50/50.  So, odds of having a girl with one preg = 1 in 2.  1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4, so the odds of having all girls with 2 kids is 1 in 4.  1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8, so the odds of having all girls with 3 kids is 1 in 8.  1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/16, so the odds of having all girls with 4 kids is 1 in 16.

Report this comment        7                  corbinator   Posted 05/09/2010      The odds are 50/50 because you only have two choices, boy or girl, like heads or tails. And since each pregnancy is independent, the chance is still 50/50 no matter how many of one gender you've had in any specific order. And I am pretty sure you are right, the sperm theory is hogwash. It's just nature. Everyone's different so even if the sperm theory was accepted, we're creating new beings all the time and the data could never keep up with every single fertile couple on Earth to prove it wrong. We just have to let it take it's course.                       Report this comment        1                     AshR822    Posted 05/09/2010      I know two different families with five girls each.

I had two miscarriages before I had my youngest son and I know that one was a girl, so I guess I know its possible. I kept thinking that if the other baby was a girl, maybe I can't carry them because a month after the last miscarriage I got pregnant with my youngest son. Anyway, I don't mind having another boy as long as he is healthy,but I always think about having my little girl someday!     --  Proud mama to 3 boys: Darrain 11/26/2003 , Damire' 11/14/2004, Braylon 9/26/2009, and Cameron 3/12/2012!!

Tuesday, November 08, 2016  Are large families of the same gender a statistical fluke? Mother of four sons, Gwen Loughman goes behind the myths In 1970’s Ireland, families with six or more children were the norm. CSO figures almost five decades later however, sees numbers for such families drop from 15,000 to a mere 3,000. Having four children in 21st century Ireland is considered a large family but to have more, and for those children to be all of the same gender, is a rarity and an attraction in itself.  Myths about how to conceive a girl or boy child have been around for centuries. During the reign of King Henry VIII it was widely believed the responsibility to produce the desired male gender fell to the female. Science has since proven otherwise.  Therese Murphy, lecturer in Medical Sciences, University of Exeter clears up just who determines the baby’s gender. “A baby’s genetic sex is determined by the man’s sperm as the sperm cell will contain either an X or a Y chromosome. It is the Y chromosome that is essential for the development of the male reproductive organs. When a Y chromosome is not present an embryo will develop into a female.”  Sex ratio  Carmel Kennedy, Ballyphehane, Cork with her eight sons. Carmel Kennedy from Ballyphehane, Cork with eight sons aged 37 to 20 is no stranger to people passing comments about her brood over the years. “I could talk for hours about some of the things people said. I did have girls but did not go to term with them. I always wanted a large family; I’m one of six girls and four boys and we had a beautiful childhood. Now I have eight healthy, respectful sons and lovely grand-daughters of my own,” she says. Professor Louise Kenny from Cork University Maternity Hospital Perinatal Medicine says in general, worldwide, slightly more boys are born than girls. “If left to nature there will be about 105 boys born for every 100 girls. However, 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 107 boys born for every 100 girls, largely driven by the skewed ratio caused by sex selection prior to birth in China, where about 118 boys are born for every 100 girls.” Statistical coincidence? Michelle Masterson Power and husband David have four daughters aged eight to 14. Their sons are six and four. “Because we were used to being parents of just girls, it meant we didn’t know any differently. David grew up with five sisters and one brother so he was very comfortable being a father of daughters. But once the boys came along, we learned the truth in that old saying, boys wreck the house. That one is so true! “ Michelle says her house was a very different one before the boys arrived. “It was very girly. Civilised, I’d say.” Michelle Masterson Power and Cillian, Orlagh, Ciarán, Eimear, Aoife, Ailbhe, Masterson Power. Naturally, there was great excitement when Cillian arrived, creating a particular interest in nappy changes! “The girls each took turns holding him and I had to time them! They were amazed when he wee’d all over me one day.” The odds of having a girl or a boy are the same with a one in two chance of it being one or the other. 50/50 if you like. However, what about bigger families of the same gender; are they a statistical coincidence? Dr Murphy again: “The probability of having a boy or a girl from a genetics point of view, remain the same each time a baby is conceived. However, there is some epidemiological evidence to suggest other factors may influence sex determination in humans. There is an argument about the motility and/ or survival of Y-carrying sperm and X-carrying sperm and timing of ovulation but it’s important to note that there are no robust ‘biological’ explanations for their observations to date.” There are various techniques and methods that allegedly improve the chances of conceiving a girl or a boy such as The Shettles Method and The Whelan Methods. Not forgetting particular diets and the slightly even more dubious practice of female douching. All have their believers and sceptics. Professor Louise Kenny has this to say. “In a nutshell there is no evidence that timing of intercourse affects sex ratio. There are several scientific studies that have disproven this. Furthermore, there is evidence that limiting intercourse within the fertile time will reduce your chances of getting pregnant at all. So my advice to couples would be to accept that at every conception there is approximately a 50:50 chance of conceiving a child of either sex and there’s very little than can be done to materially alter this,” she says. Historically speaking, there were massive gender divides. Concerns such as providing dowries for daughters and the birth of a male heir guaranteeing property retention saw one gender being preferred over the other. Thankfully, times have changed and when it comes to large families, issues like privacy and parental support are more relevant. Gwen Loughman with her sons Liam, Conor, Brendan, and Iarla. Carmel Kennedy had her own alternative support system in place when her boys were younger. “My sisters and I were there for each other and my sons had lots of friends and were always out playing so we mums would all stand at our gates and keep an eye on the kids. My coffee mornings were a cup of tea at the gate! And at night we called to each other’s houses.” She would agree being surrounded by menfolk meant privacy was limited. “I didn’t have any, I suppose. It’s only in the last seven years I have had my own bedroom space really as I always had a child or two asleep in my room. When they were babies and I was trying to shower, they used to scream at the door till I finished,” she says. Konrad, 26, is Carmel’s sixth-born and says life with seven brothers was for him just normal but, “for an outsider looking in it must have looked mental. It was never a silent house. We were all into music so it was loud and with eight boys comes a tonne of friends so people were always in and out. My mother was very relaxed. I think she likes the noise. I think we all turned out fairly well. We know now it was tough for my mother. But she never let it show,” he says. The teenage years are on the horizon for the Masterson Power family but Michelle is a woman of little or no fear. She feels can handle the mood swings and teenage dramas thanks to her daughters. “The girls are great with their brothers. They are very much the bosses but are also quite tolerable as the boys are much more demanding physically. Their dad grew up with sisters and has a great understanding of girls particularly in the teenage years, I think the boys will be the same.” Michelle and David encourage their children to have the same values as their parents when they grow up. “I tell the girls to find a man like their dad.”   © Irish Examiner Ltd.

  heterozygous for a simple Mendelian autosomal gene alpha have a child, the probability 
  that the child will show the dominant phenotype is 3/4. Let's ask
  a somewhat more complex question. If this couple has a total of four children, 
  what is the probability that 3 of the 4 will show the dominant phenotype? To 
  answer this, we will first derive the appropriate formula and then use it to 
  calculate the numerical answer. The same formula allows us to understand the 
  expected statistical distribution of the various possible phenotype patterns 
  in four-child ( or any other size) families in a large population.    1. Review: How can some simple overall probabilities be calculated 
  by combining the multiplication and addition "rules" we covered earlier?  Let's start with a very simple case: asking about gender probabilities in families 
  of three children.  What is the probability that all three children in a family will be the same 
  gender? P(all female)= 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all male ) = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all one gender) = P(all female) + P(all male) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4  What is the probability that a three-child family is two girls and one boy? Each possible birth order has P=1/8. That is, P(G,G,B)=P(G,B,G)=P(B,G,G)=1/8. So, P(2G,1B)= 3/8 and P(1G,2B)= 3/8.  This allows us to write the overall gender probability distribution for families 
  of three children as follows: 1/8 will be three girls 3/8 will be two girls and one boy 3/8 will be one girl and two boys 1/8 will be three boys Adding it all up, we have 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 1 (100%)     2. How can we understand and use "Pascal's triangle" 
  and the "general rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities", 
  formula 1 (page 161 in textbook)?  Consider the numerators of the fractions in the above three-child family gender 
  equation: 1 , 3 , 3 , 1. These numbers are the coefficients in the expansion of the term 
  (p + q) cubed. In general, the coefficients of any such binomial expansion { the 
  term (p+q) raised to any power} give the "number of ways" that something 
  can happen.  Figure 4.21, "Pascal's triangle", shows these coefficients for the expansion 
  of (p + q) raised to any power up to 10. The numbers in any row can be used 
  just as described above. For example, assume that over the next two decades 
  you have 6 kids. There are 64 possible gender birth orders, with 20 of these 
  resulting in you having three girls and three boys.  The terms p and q are the individual probabilities for a specific outcome from 
  a single "event". For "gender" calculations, the probabilities p and 
  q are equal, both = 1/2 (the equal probabilities of male and female births).  For "dominant : recessive phenotype" type of calculations, p and q will usually 
  not be equal. For a simple Mendelian inheritance from two heterozygotic parents, 
  p will = 3/4 (if AA and Aa give dominant phenotype) and q will 
  = 1/4 ( aa gives recessive phenotype).  Generalizing this, we get to the formula on page 161 in your text that is "the general 
  rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities". The term (n!/s!t!) 
  is the number of possible ways (orders) of getting a certain net outcome ( "a 
  total of n ; with s of one and t of the other"). This 
  number can either be calculated or taken directly from Pascal's triangle.    3. Sample problem: You and your mate are both heterozygous 
  for some simple Mendelian gene alpha (i.e., each of you has genotype Aa , and both of you show the dominant phenotype) on chromosome #1. Over 
  the next decade, you proceed to have four children. What is the probability 
  that 3 of your children will show the dominant phenotype and one will show the 
  recessive phenotype? What are the probabilities of the other possible outcomes?  If we were looking at thousands of such families, we know that the overall ratio 
  of dominant to recessive phenotypes in the children would average out to 3:1, 
  as shown by a simple Punnett square. But for one couple having four children, 
  what's the probability, P(3D,1r)?  To calculate P(3D,1r), we use formula 1 for the case n=4, s=3, t=1, p=3/4, 
  q=1/4. P(3D,1r)= 4!/3! x (3/4)cubed x (1/4) = 4 x (27/64) x 1/4 = .42 ( 42% )  By also calculating the other four possibilities, we can construct a graph that shows the statistical distribution you would expect 
  to see in a large population.      Problem S-4: "Heterozygous parents; have three children".  Modify the sample problem above to do the calculations for you and your mate (both Aa ) having THREE children. Do the calculations for the probabilities that all three, two, one, or none of the three children will show the dominant phenotype from gene alpha . Construct the graph and compare the result with the "four children" graph done in class.

It's in your genes, dad  By Fiona Macrae for the Daily Mail    Updated: 18:28 EDT, 10 December 2008                     View comments          The 'fatherhood gene': Researchers claim a man's chances of having a boy or a girl are decided by his genes  A man's chances of fathering a boy or a girl are written in his genes, research suggests.   Analysis of more than 900 family trees dating back to 1600 has suggested the existence of a ' fatherhood gene' that determines the sex of a man's children.   As men inherit the gene from their parents, males who have lots of brothers are likely to have sons and those with many sisters have high odds of fathering daughters. Corry Gellatly, a research scientist at Newcastle University, analysed the histories of 927 European and American families, comprising more than 500,000 people. The results suggested that a gene controls whether a man's sperm contains more X or Y chromosomes, which in turn determine the sex of his children. A child's sex is determined by the father because a woman's eggs only contain X chromosomes. When one of these combines with a sperm carrying an X chromosome, a girl is created. If it combines with a Y, the result is a boy.    It is thought that the gene comes in three forms. Men that inherit the first produce more Y sperm and have more sons. Those with the second-type produce equal numbers of X and Y sperm and so are as likely to have a boy as a girl. The third form skews the tendency towards daughters, the journal Evolutionary Biology reports. Mr Gellatly said the simple system would help keep the number of boys and girls born roughly equal. He said: 'If there are too many males in the population, for example, females will more easily find a mate, so men who have more daughters will pass on more of their genes, causing more females to be born in later generations.' The theory could also explain why shortly after the First World War an extra two boys were born for every 100 girls in the UK compared with before. Mr Gellatly said the odds were in favour of men with more sons seeing a son return from the war.  The soldiers would have inherited the tendency to have sons and so be more likely to father boys themselves. By contrast, men with more daughters may have lost their only sons in the war.

Anyway, just wondering if you did something different to increase your chances of having a girl? Also, how was your pregnancy different from with your boys. My hubby and I didn't do anything to "try" and get a girl. In fact, this baby was not planned at all. It was a ONE time "whoopsie" and I was shocked when I got a positive pregnancy test. Anyway, my symptoms are kind of different. I started feeling really nauseous super early (a little over 4 wks) and it also starts from the time I wake up. It was always later in the day with my first four pregnancies. I don't know what I'm trying to do by asking y'all this. It's not going to change anything ;-) Just curious, I guess. I really do think it's going to be another boy. Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  71 Posts T  TEWhatley I am pregnant with my 5th after four boys. We will find out Wednesday what this one is, but like you I am anticipating another boy. I feel like this pregnancy was a little different with nausea and such, but I think I get my hopes up a little each time thinking it is different:-). Good luck! I know many would disagree that it is silly to have gender disappointment, but it happens for me. I have always dreamed of having that mother/daughter bond, but once my boys are born, I love them to death. We will see Wednesday. Reply  Close m  maui_luau Pregnant with #5 too. Another boy ;) 5 boys will be crazy Reply  Close s  sarahjcampbell Hi I am pregnant 15weeks and have four sons. This pregnancy like yours wasn't really planned was a surprise and a one of time but nether the less I'm so excited and happy. I'm also hoping for a little girl but will still love a son unconditionally. This pregnancy is different well for me, with the boys I was sick morning noon and night for almost 6mths. I would say this time around im sick of a night time only and sickness cleared up by 10weeks. Also heartbeat was 162 on Friday. Thinking like every mum of 4 boys there is still a little questioning and hope for a girl but I think deep down I'm carrying a boy and to be honest I would find it very difficult to believe it's a girl until she's here. I'm so used to boys haha. Roll on 20 weeks or until he/she is born :) :) Reply  Close n  nicoleprzy @TEWhatley  I feel the same as you. I would love a daughter but if it's a boy- I will still fall in love. I look forward to hearing what you are having!! Reply  Close r  rachii92 @nicoleprzy  L Reply  Close r  rachii92 @rachii92  4th pregnancy I'm in my 29th week with my 4th boy!!! No girl yet thoe maybe next time Reply  Close S  SierraJ82 I can feel all your pain. Been there and done it many times. I have 5 boys...and sitting in my arms as I type this is my 7 week old baby girl!!! I know what it's like to love your boys with all your heart, but always feel a part of u missing without having a daughter. I am very close with my mom and felt like I would be missing something in life without a daughter to grow with. The beginning of this year I told my husband I wanted to "try" for one more. It may sound stupid but I got an app called GET BABY which keeps track of ur cycle as well as tells u when u ovulate and which days u r likEly to have a girl or a boy. Well it told me that my best chance for a girl was the day after my period finished which is exactly what I did. The one day...that's it. Then waited. ( obviously with 5 ..we've never had a problem getting pregnant. ..lol.) We'll the next month...boom...took pregnancy test and yes we were! Felt exactly like u ladies....prob would be another boy. I can say nausea was same as with boys...started around 6 weeks and gone at 12. The only thing that I personally noticed and let me say it was DRASTIC....I-was-exhausted. I would come home from work at 5 and fall asleep on the couch for hours...with 5 boys making noise all around me. I couldn't keep my eyes open. My husband luckily was very helpful and took over because he could see I just couldn't stay awake. I would wake up sometime around 11 or 12 and then just go straight to bed. I was like this until about 14 weeks and then slowly got more energy. But honestly that was the only difference for me and I remember laying on the couch falling asleep and saying to my husband...what is with me? I thought maybe because I was older.... ( this was my 1st baby in my 30's...all my boys were in my 20's) It crossed my mind for a sec that it could be a girl but I was scared to say it out loud. Lol. Sorry this is long...but I feel for you all.❤❤ That 1st ultrasound when they told me...I cried and cried... and cried all the way home...and ..all the way back to work. The next 4 months were a dream. Like I said she is 7 weeks now and has changed our house like nothing before. Watching my boys with her is soooo sweet and seeing my husband with her melts my heart. My shopping trips are filled with bags of pinks and purples...lol. she has more clothes already than any of her brothers ever did. Lol. Ladies...I wish you the best. I hope you all get a daughter to fill ur heart. There is nothing sweeter. And don't let anyone tell u that after you've had so many boys a girl is not possible. IT IS!!!! Good luck and best wishes!!!!! Reply  Close m  mjmccallop I just found out I am 4 weeks pregnant with my 5th. We already have 4 girls (20, 13, 4, and 2). A healthy baby is my foremost desire of course, but I am hoping for a boy this time. Although if that is what we have, I won't know what to do as all I have known is little girls!! LOL Reply  Close c  calebsmom0002 I have 4 boys 5,4,3,1 and I am currently pregnant with my fifth. I am 5 weeks but I want it to be a little girl.

I had sex 3 days before I ovulated to get that girl! And that was it. 3 days before and not again until after ovulation was over.

My face just broke out like crazy where as with my boys my face was flawless haha good luck Reply  Close k  kimmommy85 I'm right in the same boat! Lol I just found out yesterday I'm preggo with #5.

I just couldn't believe it it took me 30min to get myself back so the tech could finish my ultrasound lol My tech also cried lol she hugged me at the end she said she was so happy and she was honored to share such wonderful news I had my 4th baby at the same OBGYN so the nurses and of course doctors knew me, funny thing is for my 4th I told my doctor ok I need to tie and burn these very fertile tubes lol my doctor said no one more I looked at him like what??, I signed the papers for the procedure but my midwifes where bombarded with other women giving birth at the same time as me So they told me they couldn't do it that day I would have to wait 2 extra days I said no! I will pass 3 years later in May 2015 I'm pregnant it was such a shock I thought ok well I guess I'm doing this again lol but I felt iffy because here I am in my 30's this time I did have moments where I was like I can't do this I felt so weak and I felt the worse ever I would take a bite of ANYTHING and I would throw up like I eat a full course meal lol sorry for TMI Finally came 5 months and I just couldn't believe it, I carry around my ultrasound of when we found out lol I look at it and shed tears because it's just hard to swallow I'm over excited of the day that will be "it's time" I'm currently 32 weeks and overwhelmed :-) Reply  Close h  hillfamily10 I am 9 wks today with # 7 ( maybe #8 ) I feel bigger then normal so maybe twins . Anyway I had 4 boys and then 2 girls. My first girl we had the tect put the gender pic in an envelope and we found out a few days later our whole church screamed when we heard girl I was in shock I thought for sure another boy lol our second girl was such a surprise. After this one no more surprises lol I am not finding out till birth this time which my husband isn't crazy about. The only thing I found different for us is my boys birth years were odd #s (05,07,09,11) and the girls were even (12,14) so maybe a girl this time too lol I did carry my boys in my ribs and my girls super low the whole time ;) Reply  Close n  nicoleprzy Had a 12 week 2 day ultrasound (along with my MaterniT21 test) and the tech told me BOY. He got a decent between the legs shot so I have no reason not to believe him. He said 80%. I am still processing it. I love this baby no matter what but just knowing I will never have a daughter makes me kinda sad. I will get confirmation when my test results come back in the next couple weeks. Reply  Close n  nicoleprzy @maui_luau  Found out #5 is a boy. How did you feel about finding out? I feel so guilty for feeling such disappointment. Reply  Close m  mzdmommy @nicoleprzy  I felt guilty after always hearing it's a boy for 4 times in a row!!! Lol But as I heard the words it's a girl I was in total shock i just still can't believe it sometimes hehehe But I am just great full to be able to have babies as I know some can't :-( Reply  Close T  Ttblessed2016 @nicoleprzy  V Reply  Close T  Ttblessed2016 @Ttblessed2016  I'm going through the same thing. Excepting my 3rd girl. Love them to death but wanted a boy to balance and give hubby a buddy since he's an only child. I felt like crap and cried for a day but the girls are so excited about having another sister that it's easing my disappointment. From what I hear it will disappear as soon as the baby is born. But those feelings are valid and are not wrong or bad. They are valid. Feel better!

Lucy6boys wrote: Hi, just wondering if anyone has any ideas of gender stats for di/di twins? eg, boy/girl higher chances than g/g or b/b? Thanks in advance Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  29 Posts F  FirstOneNov08 I read somewhere that B/G has a higher chance but I'm not sure at all. Will be following this as I know from my MatrrniT21 test I have at least one boy!! Would love the other to be a girl. L  Lucy6boys @FirstOneNov08  Hoping some ladies even just comment what there bundles of joy were. I have 4 boys already :) D  DoubleUnicornPoo Based on general statistics and assuming your di/di twins are fraternal (there's always a chance they are identical if they are same sex), each embryo has a 50% chance of being either gender. So you basically have 4 combos: A is a boy and B is a boy. A is a boy and B is a girl. A is a girl and B is a boy. A is a girl and B is a girl. Since the 2 middle combinations are the same, you basically have a 25% chance of boy/boy, 25% girl/girl and 50% chance of boy/girl. Again, this is assuming you have fraternal twins and using basic statistics. It's probably not exactly those numbers but close to it. j  jackster185 I know I've heard that chances are higher of b/g with di/di but I don't know the statistics either. Mine are b/g, we knew at least one was a boy from NIPT and found out the other was a girl at our 19w scan. Good luck! L  Lucy6boys @DoubleUnicornPoo  Thank you so much for explaining so simply. I am paying private on 16th dec so will find out then. Xx L  Lucy6boys @jackster185  That's great and I'm hoping I have maybe one girl in there, if not I will be a mummy of 6 boys :) R  Raenstoirm @DoubleUnicornPoo  This makes sense. I also have b/g. C  Crystal4432015 I'm having girl/girl di/di twins :) We were told if they were the same sex they could be identical but not as likely if di/di k  kittykat91981 I'm having di/di twins, two boys :-) And they are most likely fraternal but my OB and MFM still say there is a chance they could be identical. s  sawchuk @Lucy6boys  I am having di/di girls t  thejenchile I have b/g. j  jlo27916 @Lucy6boys  We read somewhere it goes like this: most common to least common- b/g, g/g frat, b/b frat, g/g identical, b/b identical s  seeyouinmarch @Lucy6boys  I'm 25 wks with g/b :) d  dmblair I am 20 weeks with b/g r  renata612phd @DoubleUnicornPoo  Love the scientific explanation! And it's spot on!! o  operationmiracle @DoubleUnicornPoo  I agree with your calculation. That's what we came up with too. And we're having b/g :) I was really really hoping for at least 1 girl. We calculated a 66.6% chance of having at least one girl: Not caring who is born first or second, out of 3 options: 2 boys 2 girls 1boy/1girl 2 of the 3 options have at least 1 girl (or 66.6% chance). S  Susef 29 weeks with b/g :-) D  DaisyVc 29 weeks with g/g!! =) m  mds41 @operationmiracle  you are closer to 75% chance of a girl based on simple2525 explanation of statistics which is correct.

Then two more girls and another boy, then three more girls LOL! So 8 girls and 2 boys. That lady was wacked! s  sxymom99 Thank you all for your support!! That makes me feel better! My sister had 3 boys before she got her girl, so I am still hopeful!! My boys are so attached to me!! It's funny cause my husband says he wants a girl so at least one will like him. LOL. W  Wife2jeff @sxymom99  I just took genetics and you have a 50/50 chance with each pregnancy. They are completely seporate events that are independent from one another. That lady must have not learned about probability. Lol. M  Motocrossmama It is totally 50/50!! Just because you have 3 boys doesn't mean you won't have a girl! I'm in the same situation with 3 boys and hoping for a girl as well. J  JSS2001 My SIL had 3 boys and then a girl, so it's totally possible, and one of my brothers had 2 boys and then a girl,- so it's totally possible to have the same of one gender and then have the other gender! 50/50 chance! l  lmm242s What a crazy lady!!! That's the most far fetched opinion ever. I do think it's 50/50 but timing of conception can also play a part. l  lmhartle @sxymom99  I know you've heard this tons already nut just another reassuring voice (sort of)... It's 50/50 for each. Now your husband's sperm does play a part as well as the pH of your vaginal canal at the time of cinception, but that is a bygone. That all said, I have two wonderful boys and just expected this to be a boy as well. My DH and I used to joke he must only make boys, but we just found out we are having a girl so it can happen. Good luck!! E  Estrella422 @sxymom99  Poster Trisha_w has 3 boys and posted in Oct 4 that she is having a girl. There's always a chance. My in laws have 4 boys and 4 grandsons. My FIL is sooo hoping for a girl. I did count days to make sure some X sperms would have a chance at the egg first. Guess we will see soon enough. M  MEaMOM2010 @sxymom99  I don't think the lady that told you that you had a less than 1% chance of having a girl is right.  However, I did read some research that shows that statistically, 51% of first babies are boys and 49% are girls.  If the first baby was a boy, then second babies were 52% boys and 48% girls.  Same for third babies.  However, women who had girls first were more likely to have a boy the second time also.  So basically, even though more women who had boys the first time also had boys the second and third times, after that there was no statisticly relevant difference.  Besides, a 52% chance of having a boy is definitely not 99% chance you're having a boy!  Good luck, because I know how you feel.  I only have one boy and I'm constantly praying I get my girl this time!!! m  mommy2coryell @sxymom99  Always 50/50 chance...sorry lady at the restaurant. Â LOL. Â My friend had three girls and is now almost due with her boy. Â Happens all the time (hey, not to everyone, but keep positive!). D  DrGnome @sxymom99  As everyone else has said, each pregnancy has a 50/50 chance for gender. The lady in the restaurant was ignorant and mean--why would you ever say that to a woman who just told you she is hoping for a girl?! M  MommyAllen2010 Actually, in-gender has the stats but ... The chance of have same sex gender after two is still 50 but then after three goes down to 25% and after four goes down to 12.6% and after five goes down to 6% and so on and so forth. So, that lady has no idea what she is talking about. If anything you have a greater chance of having a girl this go around! D  DrGnome @MommyAllen2010  The chance is 50/50 every single time. However, the chance of having 3 of the same gender in a row is 12.5%, and the chance of having 4 of the same gender in a row is 6%. The gender of children you already have doesn't influence every new pregnancy. Does that make sense? It's absolutely true. I have a degree in genetics :-) Related Articles & Discussions Thoughts Pregnant Moms Have After Finding Out the Sex of Their Baby  Finding out whether you're having a boy or a girl is one of the most magical moments during pregnancy.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!  You'll also want to see: What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?             Gender Odds   What are the odds of having another boy or girl?

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Visit our community    Can you really choose the sex of your baby? For as long as we've been making babies , women have been exchanging ideas about how to increase their chances of having either a boy or a girl. Unfortunately there's no medical evidence that any of them actually work!  Having said that, there'll always be a mum who tells you an old wives' tale worked for her. So if you fancy defying the experts and trying to tip the balance towards one sex yourself, why not try some of the suggestions below.   You're more likely to conceive a boy if... You have sex on the day of ovulation , as male sperm are thought to swim faster and reach the egg first. You reach orgasm before your partner, as this releases an alkaline fluid, thought to be more male-sperm friendly than the vagina's natural acidity. You have deep penetration during sex, such as from behind (doggie-style). Your partner has a high sperm count. This is because male sperm are not as strong as female sperm, and so the higher the count, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first. You avoid sex for a week before ovulation and then only have sex once on ovulation day, to keep the sperm count high. Your partner suggested the love-making. You make love at night. You make love on odd days of the month. Your partner keeps his genitals cool by wearing boxer shorts and loose-fitting trousers. You eat salty food, plenty of meat, fish, white flour, pasta, fresh fruit, certain vegetables, but avoid milk and dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, nuts, chocolate, shellfish and wholemeal bread. You're more likely to conceive a girl if... You have sex earlier on in your cycle, a few days before your day of ovulation. This is because female sperm are thought to be stronger and therefore last longer than male sperm, who will die off before reaching the egg. Your partner reaches orgasm before you. You have sex frequently to lower your partner's sperm count, and so increase the chances of the female sperm reaching the egg first. You keep penetration shallow. You stop having unprotected sex four to five days before ovulation, to minimise the chances of the male sperm reaching the egg first. Your partner keeps his genitals warm by wearing close-fitting underwear and tight trousers (although this isn't likely to do his general fertility any good!) You suggested the love-making. You make love in the afternoon. You make love on even days of the month. You put a wooden spoon under your bed and a pink ribbon under your pillow. You drink plenty of milk and eat dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, unsalted foods, rice, pasta, certain vegetables, mineral water, limited amounts of meat and potatoes, but avoid salt and any salty foods, wine and beer, fresh fruit, spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms, chocolate, coffee and tea.

Ultimately, I picked Urobiologics (based in the US) who have literally proven that, although gender is 'determined' by sperms, women select the gender of the baby based on the cycle she conceives, by choosing to conceive in the correct alternating cycle. We were given a conception plan to try to conceive in the girl cycle (you send off urine samples to Urobiologics, who will then determine when you will be in a boy or girl cycle). We became pregnant with our girl (we used their post-gender test to check the gender of the baby at around 7 weeks). Sadly our little Poppy girl died at 16 weeks (31 Oct) due to a PPROM, so we are leaving it a couple of months to heal and then go via the PreGender Preconception Test route again. I'm ready now!

Top tips for conceiving a girl   What’s a fact and what’s fallacy?   Timing of intercourse   How do I know when I’ve ovulated?   General tips to help conceive a girl  Are you longing for a girl? Do you already have a one boy or more and now want to see if you can tip the gender balance in your household? There are lots of theories and claims made about influencing the chances of having either a boy or a girl baby, but the scientific facts are absolutely clear. The chances of having a boy or a girl are almost exactly equal for each and every pregnancy. Even though some couples only seem to make boys, or girls, this patterning owes more to luck than management.   Top tips for conceiving a girl   have sex 2.5-4 days before you ovulate  keep an ovulation chart so you know when you are ovulating  have sex every day from the day when you finish your period  avoid having sex which involves deep penetration – missionary position is best  purchase an alkaline testing kit from the pharmacy to find out your vaginal ph  eat foods that support a more acidic vaginal ph, like green leafy vegetables, wholegrains, meat, sweets, corn and blueberries    What’s a fact and what’s fallacy?   To conceive with a girl, an X chromosome linked sperm from your partner needs to get to your egg first.  If a Y linked sperm gets in before an X, then you will have a boy.  It’s important to remember that it is always the man who determines the sex of the baby.   Women always carry a pair of X chromosomes whereas men carry an X and Y.  It is a fallacy that men who are less masculine father girls.  It is a fallacy that one of the testicles only produces X (girl) sperm and the other only produces Y (boy) sperm.  Lunar cycles, diet , sexual positions, homeopathy and assorted complimentary medicine practices do no influence the likelihood of having a boy or a girl.   If you really want to minimise your chances of having a boy and maximise the odds of having a girl, then gender selection through a fertility clinic is your best bet. But in Australia at the current time, just having a preference for one gender more than the other is insufficient reason to sign up. This process is tremendously expensive and fraught with potential problems, especially if the desired baby is not the ‘right’ gender.  So, unless there is a strong likelihood of your baby carrying a sex linked chromosomal abnormality, it is unlikely that using a gender selection clinic is an option for you.    Characteristics of girl sperm  What this means to you    Tend to be slow moving and longer lasting.  Interesting point, but really doesn’t mean much in terms of your control.    Are real little energy houses which survive for longer in hostile vaginal conditions.  Again, interesting to note. May influence when you have sex in relation to your ovulation.    Can survive in the vagina for up to four days without dying off.  Don’t need to be so specific about timing sex to coincide with ovulation-such as when aiming for a boy .      Characteristics of boy sperm  What this means to you    Are not as long lasting, need assistance to get to the egg as quickly as possible.  Time sex to coincide with ovulation if you want a boy .   Have lots of energy at the start but don’t have the staying power which girl sperm do.  Stop trying to conceive around three days before you ovulate if you want a girl. But bear in mind, this will reduce your overall odds of conceiving as well.   Timing of intercourse If you are keen to have girl, then you need to think about, plan for and execute your strategy to include exactly how and when you are going to have sex. Forget just waiting to see what happens or being relaxed about it. Bear in mind that in order to maximise your chances of conceiving either a boy or a girl then you need to have produced an egg which the sperm can then fertilise. Having lots of sex throughout your cycle will provide you with the best chances of having any baby. If you limit the opportunity for conception to occur this will in turn, reduce your chances of having either a boy or a girl. In the 1960’s Dr. Shettles developed a range of strategies which could boost the probability of parents having either a girl or a boy. According to Shettles, to conceive a girl you need to:  Have sex 2.5 – 4 days before you ovulate . Timing sex is the key here, so it would help if you keep an ovulation chart where you can predict what days of your cycle you are likely to ovulate and have lots of sex before you release an egg.  Have sex everyday from the day when you finish your period. This helps to deposit lots of the longer lasting X sperm so they are ready to fertilise the egg once it is released from the ovaries.  Preparation is the key to conceiving a girl. Don’t wait for the last moment to have sex. Boosting your chances of having a girl is similar to saving for a home loan. Make lots of deposits nice and early and then, when the time is right you are in the best position to gain the rewards.  Shettles also advises that if couples want to conceive with a girl:  Avoid having sex at the time when you ovulate or just afterwards. Having sex when ovulation is still some days away supports the slower moving X sperm.  Mucous which is produced before ovulation tends to be more acidic and this helps to conceive with a girl. Women who are sensitive to their body’s changes are in the best possible position to know when they are fertile.  If manageable, women need to avoid having an orgasm during sex. Shettles claims female orgasm helps to produce a more alkaline vaginal environment which favours boy sperm. The muscular uterine contractions also give the boy sperm a boost towards the fallopian tubes which is where conception usually takes place.   How do I know when I’ve ovulated?  Many women develop a distinctive pain on one side of their lower pelvis, which occurs mid-way through their monthly cycle.  Changes in the cervical mucous. Fertile mucous is clear, watery and stretchy – it appears similar to egg white. This is because the cells change to encourage the smooth passage of sperm upwards through the cervix towards the fallopian tubes. Fertile mucous is also less acidic than non-fertile mucous and this environment favours the sperm rather than killing them off.  You could try using an ovulation testing kit. These detect hormonal changes which occur at ovulation, particularly an increase in Luteinizing Hormone. But there is still some disagreement over their effectiveness. Kits cost anywhere between $25.00 – $40.00 (see below).  You may feel different. Women who have ovulated and are at their most fertile often experience an increase in their libido; they appear more attractive and are more relaxed.  An increase in your basal body temperature. This is the lowest temperature which is attained by your body during rest and sleep. Just before ovulation occurs there is a rise in the temperature by a couple of degrees.  Bear in mind that the ovulation testing kits which work by measuring hormonal levels in the saliva, rather than the urine, are supposed to be more exact.  General tips to help conceive a girl  Avoid having sex which involves deep penetration. The missionary position may be preferable because the semen/sperm are not deposited as closely to the cervix as the all fours position. A shallow position is preferable when trying to have a girl baby.  Enlist your partner’s cooperation if you’re trying to have a girl. There may be changes from your usual sexual routine. Communication and shared decision making will go a long way towards avoiding misunderstandings at ‘delicate’ moments.  It seems that girl sperm favour a more acidic environment. This is largely out of your control though there may be some foods which favour the acidic ph. Alkaline testing kits are available from pharmacies if you’re keen to find out what your individual vaginal ph may be.  There is a theory that girl sperm are more prolific when a man is ejaculating daily. But just to confuse us, there is another theory which claims that it takes a couple of days for total sperm numbers to build up to maximum numbers after ejaculation.  One option is to use condoms during sex which occurs over the woman’s most fertile days. These will limit the opportunity for any conception to occur, but does support Shettles theory of a greater likelihood of boy conception at the time of ovulation .  Foods which are likely to support a more acidic vaginal ph are thought to be great for boosting the chances of having a girl.  To boost your chances of having a baby girl, try eating more of these foods:  Green leafy vegetables. Be aware that some researchers claim mothers who are keen to conceive with a girl should avoid most fruits and vegetables, though in a dietary sense this is generally not advisable for anyone. Folic acid is an important nutrient in the first trimester and green leafy vegetables are one of the major sources of folate.  Wholegrains such as breads, cereal and rice.  Meat.  Sweets, lollies, desserts and cakes. (Lucky you)!  Avoid eating nuts, specifically almonds.  Eat corn and blueberries.  Aim to eat foods which are high and rich in magnesium, such as fish, fruit and grains.  There is some science to support the theory that women who have a higher energy intake in their diets are more likely to have boys. More kilojoules per day favours those little boys it seems. So the reverse may be true to help boost the chances of having a girl. Just remember, there are no guarantees.

Folic acid is an important nutrient in the first trimester and green leafy vegetables are one of the major sources of folate.  Wholegrains such as breads, cereal and rice.  Meat.  Sweets, lollies, desserts and cakes. (Lucky you)!  Avoid eating nuts, specifically almonds.  Eat corn and blueberries.  Aim to eat foods which are high and rich in magnesium, such as fish, fruit and grains.  There is some science to support the theory that women who have a higher energy intake in their diets are more likely to have boys. More kilojoules per day favours those little boys it seems. So the reverse may be true to help boost the chances of having a girl. Just remember, there are no guarantees.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!

What if you already have one boy or 2 or 3 boys? Is it really a 50% chance that you will have a girl next? Let’s look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly. Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.    If you have no children, then statistically, you have a 49% chance of having a girl first.   If you have one boy, the odds of having a girl as a second child are 50%.  If you have 2 boys, the odds of having a girl as a third child are 47.7%.  If you have 3 boys, the odds of having a girl as a fourth child are 43.6%.   Odds of Having a Boy The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.  If you have no children, statistically, the odds of having a boy first are 51%.   If you have one girl, the odds of having a boy next are 54.5%.  If you have 2 girls, the odds of having a boy next are 46%.  If you have 3 girls, the odds of having a boy next are 52.7%.   Gender and Birth Order Given the information above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children. This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio. This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn’t consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   With first born children,  51.0% are Boys.  With second born children, 52.2% are Boys.  With third born children, 48.6% are Boys.  With fourth born children, 50.8% are Boys.   Odds of Having an All Same-Gender Family  If there are roughly even odds of having a boy or a girl with each baby, given the laws of chance we should still expect to see some all same-gender families, even in large families. Here is the number of all same-gender families we would expect to see, using good ole fashioned statistics:     Family Size  Same-Gender  Mixed-Gender    2 Children  50%  50%    3 Children  25%  75%    4 Children  12.5%  87.5%    5 Children  6%  94%    6 Children  3%  97%    7 Children  1.6%  98.4%     Conclusion Although we often hear from our moms, grandmothers even doctors that the chance for you to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale. It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly. If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only about 2% to 6% more likely to have another boy. If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next.

One child is a girl. What is the probability that the other child is a boy? [duplicate]         up vote  5  down vote  favorite  1       This question already has an answer here:    In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?  20 answers     My initial thought process: Sample space: GG, GB, BG, BB. I then crossed out BG because it's the same as GB because order doesn't matter here. And because we know one is a girl, there leaves two possibilities left. If the other is a boy, the probability should be 1/2, much like how they deduced it Finding probability of other child also being a boy .  However, I was told by my teacher that the answer is not 1/2 . I'm wondering if any of you guys can see a way in how the question is worded so that it's not 1/2... I don't think there's any other factors?    probability     share | cite | improve this question      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:21       Community ♦   1        asked Dec 14 '13 at 22:05       iamashortgiraffe   28 1 1 4           marked as duplicate by M Turgeon , TMM , user127.0.0.1 , T.

The sample space is (and needs to be) $\{BB, BG, GB, GG\}.$  We know one child is a girl, so that rules out BB. That leaves us with a sample space of BG, GB, GG  In which case the probability that the second child is a boy is $\dfrac 23$.   Each of the four outcomes has a probability of $\frac 14$. BG: "Having a boy, and then a girl" is a different outcome than $GB:$ having a girl, and then a boy.  To omit one of the boy-girl/girl-boy pairs leaves a sample space of three, with each outcome having probability of 13, which is not correct. Having a boy-girl pair is twice as likely as having two boys, and twice as likely as having 2 girls, and we can only obtain this by counting all four outcomes as distinct, indeed, distinguishable.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 18 '13 at 15:55             answered Dec 14 '13 at 22:07       amWhy   187k 25 215 427                  I was thinking about that, but why? You're just taking a pair of children, so whether it's BG or GB shouldn't matter because either way you're getting a girl and boy? – iamashortgiraffe  Dec 14 '13 at 22:08        1      Because each of the four outcomes has a probability of $\dfrac 14$.

If you knew that the older child was a girl, then the sample space would be simply $\{GG,GB\}$, where the older child is listed first, and the probability would indeed be $\frac12$. Similarly, if you knew that the younger child was a girl, the probability would be $\frac12$. If you knew that the taller child was a girl, it would be $\frac12$. But all you know here is that one of the children is a girl; if you list the possibilities in the order older-younger, you can rule out only $BB$. – Brian M. Scott  Dec 14 '13 at 22:15            Thanks for chiming in, @Brian. The word "distinguishable" was on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't "find" it when I was trying to explain in the comments.

If we assume that boys and girls are born with equal probability, then the probability to have two girls (and one boy) should be the same as the probability to have two boys and one girl. So you would have two cases with probability 2/3, giving an impossible 4/3 probability for both cases. – Thomas Padron-McCarthy  Jun 1 '16 at 6:48         10      Also, your list "Boy-Boy-Girl, Boy-Girl-Boy, and Girl-Boy-Boy" seems strange.

Strictly speaking, none of the answers are correct. If you make a few assumptions (some of which definitely aren't true for actual families) then you can get 3/8. The answer of 3/8 is an approximate solution, of the "assume a spherical cow" variety. – Glen_b  Jun 2 '16 at 2:26         add a comment |           8 Answers 8     active  oldest  votes            up vote  58  down vote      No, the possible outcomes are

wherein $3$ meet the requirement. There are $8$ possible outcomes, all equally likely (if we assume each gender is equally likely).  Hence the choice is $3/8$.  We can also think about it in at least one more way: 
You identified all the possible ways to get 2 boys and one girl. Since the events are disjoint, we can add up the probabilities
\begin{align*}
P(\text{2 boys, 1 girl}) &= P(\mathsf{BBG})+P(\mathsf{BGB})+P(\mathsf{GBB}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{3}{8}.

BBB, BBG, BGG, and GGG could be used as the unordered results, but the middle two would need to be weighted 3x because there are 3 ways that each outcome is possible. – Dan Neely  Jun 2 '16 at 13:41        3      @Randy: Order doesn't matter, which is why the probability of all the combinations with the same frequency distribution of each sex are added together — i.e. all those with two boys and one girl — and then divided by the the total of all possible ones. – martineau  Jun 2 '16 at 13:45             Ok I get it.

So, let p be the probability of a boy, q the probability of a girl, and r be the probability of one of those other genders, with p+q+r=1.  Assume that genders are independent of previous births.

So if you had a lottery ticket, it matters whether you had the right combination of numbers. Or in this case, we are asking for the number of boys and girls, rather than the order that they appeared. The Permutations do consider order, so that would be more like a code for a safe that must be done in order, or the letters in a password, or in this case the sequence of genders where BGB would be a different sequence to GBB.  So a combination is like the list of stuff at the beginning of a recipe, and the permutation is the order that you add the ingredients. You can take the same list of things and add them in different amounts and different orders, and it will likely make a big difference to the result.  Working from combinations  Just to add that you can do it via combinations, as you originally thought, but you have to take into account the relative probabilities of those combinations, which derive from the set of permutations. As we have seen from the other answers, there are 3 permutations out of 8 which contain 2 boys and a girl.  But what if we looked at the combinations instead? The combinations of 2 genders among 3 children are:   3 girls  2 girls, 1 boy  1 girl, 2 boys  3 boys   Now for the frequencies   3 girls can only be arranged 1 way, so this is a frequency of 1  2 girls, 1 boy can be rearranged, and the boy can have 3 positions (youngest, middle or oldest). Once we have the position of the boy, the girls are known, so there are 3 positions  1 girl, 2 boys: same logic as above, frequency of 3  3 boys: as with 3 girls, frequency of 1   The total of them all is 8, and the number matching our requirement is 3, giving 3/8ths.  In this question, the easiest and clearest approach was to list out the permutations and count how many matched our requirement. For larger problems, it can be simpler to either quickly collect the easy cases and then look at the permutations for a restricted set, or focus on the possible combinations. This is particularly true when there are more complex options in the construction of the set.  Edit: More on Combinations and Permutations  @WoJ has a question: why does order matter? Suppose they were triplets?  I'm not saying that the chronological order of birth is what matters, only that you have to label them. We generally write permutations as a sequence which maps to an ordering of the variables; if I flip a coin 3 times and the result is HTH then I'm implicitly saying that the sequence represents the flips ordered chronologically. But we could flip 3 coins and order them by size, or by the age of the coin; it's just a way of identifying the different flips so that we can correctly account for the possibilities.  But! You must label them before you consider how they landed . Arranging heads first then tails is already turning the result from a permutation to a combination, and making things much harder by making the result dependent on the values, when they were independent variables at the beginning. So to assess the relationship between the original tosses and the resulting combinations we have to label them first or we'll give ourselves a headache.  We can see that it is the permutations that matter rather than the combinations for random independent coin flips by doing this experiment: flip 2 coins, and if they land the same (2H or 2T), then mark 1 in the 'Same' column. If they land differently (1H 1T) then mark 1 in the 'Diff' column. If the probability is determined by the combinations, then there is only 1 combination (1H 1T) that will give a 'Diff' result, vs 2 (2H and 2T) that give a 'Same' result, and after a few rounds of flips we should see twice as many marks in the 'Diff' column. Feel free to try the experiment; run it maybe 20 times so that it is clear whether the answer is more like 2:1 or like 1:1.  I predict that the result will be 1:1, because the probability is in the coin flip, so we have to look there for the statistical basis of our calculations. The probability is 50/50 of a single independent coin flip. So the first flip (or the flip of the biggest or oldest coin) is 50/50 H or T. Now, given that the first flip was a Head, what will the second be? These are independent coin flips, so the chances are still 50/50. This gives us a second value. Since these are independent flips, we label them differently and draw up either a table of their values, or a list of the permutations:  First
         H    T
2nd  H  0.25 0.25
     T  0.25 0.25  Now we can look at the categorisation of these permutations as combinations:  H       T
 H    2H     1H 1T
 T   1H 1T    2T  So although there are 3 labelled combinations (2H, 2T, 1H 1T), they are not evenly spread among the permutations (HH, TT, HT, TH), and we have already said that in this case the probability is being driven by the permutations, not the combinations. So to correctly account for the probabilities assigned to those combinations, we have to start from the permutations and see how they map to combinations; 2 go to becoming '1H 1T', and one each to '2H' and '2T'. How do they then map to the categories of 'Same' and 'Diff'?  H    T            1H 1T  Diff  = 0.25+0.25
 H   Same Diff   or    2H     Same  = 0.25
 T   Diff Same         2T     Same  = 0.25  And thus we have P(Same) = 0.25+0.25 = 0.5 and P(Diff) = 0.25+0.25 = 0.5.  At no point have we cared how we ordered the coins, only that we could identify them separately because they have independent probabilities assigned to their flips.  Are there cases where you can't get the answer by just looking at the permutations? Yes, absolutely. For example, the permutations are not always neatly equally likely as we have in these constructed problems. The possible colours of socks in my drawer might be Yellow, Green and Black, but I have a lot more Black socks because the world doesn't share my fascination with Green yet. If we looked at the permutations of 2 socks picked from the drawer, we would get YY, YG, YB, GY, GG, GB, BY, BG, BB. If we just naively looked at the permutations we might imagine the chance of getting a matched pair was 3/9, or 1/3. But it is not, because there are a lot more black socks.  We might instead have a lottery ticket, which only matters what the combination is; then looking at the permutations would be a fruitless exercise, as the drawing process enforces the relationship between probability and combination rather than permutation.  Triplets by combination  Do demonstrate the problems of arranging the triplet birth result into combinations before applying the probabilities, let's actually calculate it that way around. We flip 3 coins, and ignoring the chronology arrange them with heads first. The possible results are HHH, HHT, HTT, TTT. 4 combinations.  But how can we apply our probability that each birth is 50/50? By rearranging the order, we are breaking the mapping between an individual birth and the item in the combination; you can see that straight away in that the only way the first coin in our rearranged set can be a T is if all 3 coins came up T, and we know intuitively that that's much less likely than the probability for any given toss being T. Can we still do it? Well, yes, but it's tricky.  The first combination is HHH. What is the chance of throwing HHH? The flips are independent, and these coins can be rearranged however you like, but it will always have to be 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.125. So immediately the HHH combination has a chance of 0.125 instead of 0.25. Just because we have 4 categories, doesn't mean the probability relates to that number in any way.  The same argument applies for TTT. So now we have accounted for 0.25 of the probability out of half the combinations.  What of HHT and HTT? Well, since the chances of H and T are equal, we could relabel H as T and T as H, or call the sides A and B without any loss of generality, so the probabilities must be equal here too; both combinations are 2 of one and 1 of the other. So the remaining 6/8 of the probability give us 3/8 for each option.  What if H and T were not interchangeable? Suppose P(H) was 3/5, not 1/2? We can see that the combinations don't give us a straight answer because they are unchanged (3H, 2H, 1H, 0H) but we know intuitively that the chances of getting 2H must depend on the bias of the coin flip. Here we would have a remaining probability of 1 - 0.4*0.4*0.4 - 0.6*0.6*0.6 = 0.72. The two remaining combinations are HTT and HHT. So we know that the first and last of those coins came out the same, and this is the set of tosses which contain one head and one tail. Removing that head and tail leaves the outcome of a single coin. It doesn't matter which order the coins were tossed in, or even how we reordered them afterwards. The final coin has P(H)=0.6 and P(T)=0.4, so P(H)/P(T) = 1.5. We already have the other two coins, so we have P(2H 1T)/P(1H 2T) = 1.5. Distributing the remaining probability of 0.72 gives us P(2H 1T)+P(1H 2T)=0.72, and we can then substitute to get P(2H 1T)+P(2H 1T)/1.5=0.72, so P(2H 1T)=0.432.  By contrast, to calculate that from the original tosses, we have:  P(2H,1T) = P(HHT)+P(HTH)+P(THH) 
         = .6*.6*.4 + .6*.4*.6 + .4*.6*.6
         = 0.144 * 3 = 0.432  So if we have independent variables (births, coin tosses), it is easiest to look at the permutations and collect the probabilities of the permutations we want than to start from the combinations and work backwards to figure out how their probabilities relate to the individual variable probabilities. But it is not impossible, and in some cases preferable.  TLDR: The important thing is to look at the mechanism by which randomness appears in the system, and to then measure the probabilities from there either in terms of combinations or permutations, but not blindly applying either as the method entirely depends on the mechanism of the randomness. Both approaches can be made to work, but only if you correctly account for the probabilities according to the system you are considering.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 3 '16 at 13:20             answered Jun 1 '16 at 10:05       Phil H   883 1 5 12                  I have a hard time understanding why the order needs to be taken into account at all. Let's imagine they were triplets which were born at the same time. The outcome of this pregnancy can be one of the four you listed. Out of these only one satisfies the requirement, so why isn't the probability 1/4? – WoJ  Jun 2 '16 at 14:00            @WoJ: I have added a further wall of text to answer you. Basically, it's not about chronology but about labelling so that we can apply the probability we know about (that each birth is 50/50 boy or girl). By arranging the results into combinations, you have already skipped the step of relating the individual birth probabilities to permutation probabilities, and thus are not accounting for the given probabilities correctly. If that isn't clear, let me know. – Phil H  Jun 3 '16 at 11:39            I like the idea of having him do a simulation by coin flipping!   A couple hundred trials should be enough to distinguish between 3/8 and 1/3. I wonder if this would be permitted on the exam...  It is almost like cheating.  But I remember a theorem in probability to the effect that anything can be simulated by a sequence of Bernoulli trials. – richard1941  Jun 8 '16 at 23:25         add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      A systematic way to calculate @probablyme s answer to encode the letters B (boy) and G (girl) as a 3 digit binary number with the logical value 1 for true and 0 for false ( that the digit represents a boy ).  Then we loop through all combinations, for example by incrementing by 1  each step.$$000\to001\to010\to011\to100\to 101\to110\to111$$  We then count the total number of "ones" equals 2. This is the same as the "population count" function used in this question and answer .  The output of the function would be:
$$0\to1\to1\to2\to1\to2\to2\to3$$  And as we can see, for 3 of the 8 states the function evaluates to 2. This means that after counting all possibilities, we found that 3 of the 8 equiprobable states correspond to two boys. This gives a probability of $\frac{3}{8}$.   The strength of this approach is of course that if we modify the question to account for more advanced things, these can be included with fast logical bit-wise operations on the numbers!     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:21       Community ♦   1        answered Jun 1 '16 at 16:28       mathreadler   12.9k 7 17 54              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Since the question does not mention the order, the possible combinations are   3 Boys  2 Boys and 1 Girl (3 ways to do it)  1 Boy and 2 Girls (3 ways to do it)  3 Girls   That means the correct answer is 37,5% or 3/8     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 1 '16 at 11:44             answered Jun 1 '16 at 11:37       GodlyHedgehog   1 2                  Did you really compute 37½% before rationalizing it to 3/8? – Anton Sherwood  Jun 7 '16 at 18:50             In my high school some teachers asked to write probability-related values with percentage. – GodlyHedgehog  Jun 21 '16 at 9:58        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      because 'not a boy' is same as a girl (opposite), it could be calculated like this.  $ \binom{3}{2}  (\frac{1}{2})^2(\frac{1}{2})^{2-1} = 0.375 $   $ \binom{n}{k}  (p)^k(1-p)^{n-k} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 2 '16 at 10:36       P_95   1 1              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The following method avoids any need to consider the number of permutations with 2 boys and 1 girl.  3 children must include either at least 2 boys or at least 2 girls (but not both).

They have two kids. One of them is a girl. What
  is the probability that the other kid is also a girl?   This is a classical problem in probability. What makes this question confusing is the fact that the question is ambiguous since there may be no such thing as "the other kid".  Suppose a couple has two children, call then $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$. When you say "one of them is a girl" two possible interpretations are:  #1 Someone told me the couple has at least one girl but I don't know if both children are girls, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl, or if $\mathcal{Y}$ is a girl; the possible cases are GG, GB, BG. I want to compute the probability that both of the couple's children are girls (GG).  or  #2 Someone told me $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl but I don't know if $\mathcal{Y}$ is a boy or a girl; the possible cases are GG, GB. I want to compute the probability that $\mathcal{Y}$ is also a girl (GG).  Now, you can answer each of these questions using, for example, expressions for conditional probabilities (the answers to interpretations #1 and #2 are 1/3 and 1/2, respectively). However, if you are left with a feeling of "sure, I see how you can obtain that result but why isn't my answer correct?" read on.   Interpretation #1:  (This is the one I find interestingly confusing.)  When you first think about the problem you might use the following ( incorrect ) reasoning:   I know at least one of the children is a girl, what is the probability
  that the other child (the child of unknown gender) is also a girl? well,
  shouldn't it be 1/2? I mean, the other child can be a boy or a girl regardless ... right?   One of the problems with this reasoning is that there is no such thing as " the child of unknown gender " (therefore, there is no such thing as " the other child "). In fact, you do not know either of the children's genders (in this interpretation both children have unknown gender!). All you know is that there is a girl in there somewhere, but you do not know which of the two children is the girl. How can you hope to compute the probability that the other child (the child of unknown gender) is a girl if there is no such thing as "the child of unknown gender"? In fact, if you happen to know that $\mathcal{X}$ (or $\mathcal{Y}$) is a girl then you are using a different interpretation of the question (interpretation #2).  The other problem with this reasoning is related to independence. As people have pointed out, given the added overarching assumption that there is at least one girl, "$\mathcal{X}$'s gender" and "$\mathcal{Y}$'s gender" are not independent random variables. This is easy to see since, for example, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a boy then $\mathcal{Y}$ is forced to be a girl with probability 1 (not 1/2). This lack of independence is the reason why you can't say that one of the two children is a boy or girl independently/regardless of the other.  Formal Derivation of Answer to Interpretation #1:  Using the formula for conditional probabilities we have
\begin{align*}
P\big(\text{Both are Girls } \big| \text{ At Least One Girl}\big)&=\frac{P\Big(\big(\text{Both are Girls}\big)\cap\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)\Big)}{P\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)}\\
&=\frac{P\big(\text{Both are Girls}\big)}{P\big(\text{At Least One Girl}\big)}\\
&= \frac{1/4}{3/4}=\frac{1}{3}.
\end{align*}   Interpretation #2:  I don't think there is anything confusing about this interpretation. You know the $\mathcal{X}$ is a girl and $\mathcal{Y}$ can be a girl or a boy independently of $\mathcal{X}$. In this case, the random variables "$\mathcal{X}$'s gender" and "$\mathcal{Y}$'s gender" are not linked by any added overarching assumption and are independent.  Formal Derivation of Answer to Interpretation #2:  Using the independence of the second child's gender relative to the first child's gender:  \begin{align*}
P\big(\text{Second is a Girl } \big| {\text{ First is a Girl}}\big)=P\big(\text{Second is a Girl}\big)=\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}   Regarding the second question:   Now A and B have 4 children and all of them are boys. B is pregnant.
  So what is the probability that A and B are gifted with a baby girl?
  Is it 1/2 or there will be some conditional probability?   The answer is that the next child's gender is independent of the first four children's genders (by assumption), this is because there is no added overarching assumption involving the next child. The answer is then simply $1/2$. (This is just like in Interpretation #2.)     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Aug 10 '17 at 17:41             answered May 26 '16 at 19:48       Karla H.   503 1 10                  +1 Thanks for the lovely answer to an often asked question.

While I've known the mathematical answer to this problem and have been familiar with the ambiguity of the question for a while, I had always struggled to explain (without math) why the incorrect reasoning was incorrect. In my head the answer was often just "that's not how probability works". I'm glad to have come up with a semi-satisfying non-math-based explanation. – Karla H.  Jun 5 '16 at 18:50            i dont see how is this reliable? i know the answer is right but P(A/B) is calculated only if A and B are dependent, how the events of giving birth of two babies are affecting eachother conditionally ?if someone roll a dice and makes 6, the second toss would never depend on the first. – Abra001  Jun 5 '16 at 19:54             First: you can compute P(A|B) regardless of whether A and B are dependent or not.  Second: You are almost right, without other assumptions two babies can be assumed to have independent gender. However, in this case you are adding another assumption : you can't have two boys. Originally the babies genders are independent but once you start adding assumptions like "you can't have two boys" or "the second baby has to have different gender than the first baby" then the genders can become dependent random variables. – Karla H.

In this case, $A$ is the event that the other kid is a girl, and $B$ is the event that one of the kids is a girl.  $A\cap B$ would be both kids are girls, which has a probability of $\frac14$.  $B$ would be the event that one of the kids is a girl, which has a probability of $\frac34$.  Therefore, the required probability is $\frac{1/4}{3/4}=\frac13$.   And for the second question, we can do it using conditional probability or without.  Using conditional probability:  $A$ be the event that the fifth child is a girl.  $B$ be the event that the first four children are boys.  $P(A\cap B)$ would be $\left(\frac12\right)^5=\frac1{32}$.  $P(B)$ would be $\left(\frac12\right)^4=\frac1{16}$.  The required probability would be $\frac{1/32}{1/16}=\frac12$.  Without using conditional probability:  Notice that event $A$ is independent on event $B$.  Therefore, $P(A)=\frac12$.   Notes  In the first question, the probability in question is the probability that "the other kid is also a girl", making the two events dependent.  However, in the second question, the word other is gone, leaving us with independent events.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 26 '16 at 10:56             answered May 26 '16 at 10:45       Kenny Lau   13.9k 20 44                  and for the second question? – Hailey  May 26 '16 at 10:46        add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Originally there are $4$ equiprobable possibilities: BB,GB,GG,BG.

This is an example where we need to be extra careful using ordinary language to express what we mean mathematically.  Does it mean :   One specific kid is a girl ( for example first born ).  Any one of the two kids is a girl.  Exactly one of the kids is a girl (thanks to drhab's comment)   For 1 we only have the freedom left to consider two cases girl & boy which should be an equi-probable independent event. That is: probability $1/2$.  For 2 it is like sampling one of the letters $\{BB, BG, GB, GG\}$, noticing that it is a $G$ and then wondering what the other would be. As you can see there is only one G which has another G besides it but three which have any 1 G, so here the probability it would be $1/3$.  For 3 it could be if a parent says "I have two children of which one is a girl" it probably is assumed that only one of the kids is a girl and then the probability of second kid to be a girl would be 0.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 27 '16 at 11:41             answered May 26 '16 at 20:49       mathreadler   12.9k 7 17 54              1      There is even a third possibility: one of the kids is a girl could also mean exactly one of the kids is a girl .

Suppose there is a birthday party to which all of the girls (and none of the boys) in a small town are invited. If you run into a mother who has dropped off a kid at this birthday party and who has two children, the chance that she has two girls is $1/3$. Why? $3/4$ of the mothers with two children will have a daughter at the birthday party, the ones with two girls ($1/4$ of the total mothers with two children) and the ones with one girl and one boy ($1/2$ of the total mothers with two children). Out of these $3/4$ of the mothers, $1/3$ have two girls.  On the other hand, if the birthday party is only for fifth-grade girls, you get a different answer. Assuming there are no siblings who are both in the fifth grade, the answer in this case is $1/2$. The child in fifth grade is a girl, but the other child has probability $1/2$ of being a girl. Situations of this kind arise in real life much more commonly than situations of the other kind, so the answer of $1/3$ is quite nonintuitive.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '10 at 1:54             answered Dec 23 '10 at 1:05       Peter Shor   2,466 14 22              add a comment |             up vote  60  down vote      In a family with 2 children there are four possibilities:  1) the first child is a boy and the second child is a boy (bb)  2) the first child is a boy and the second child is a girl (bg)  3) the first child is a girl and the second child is a boy (gb)  4) the first child is a girl and the second child is a girl (gg)  Since we are given that at least one child is a girl there are three possibilities: bg, gb, or gg.

Your text says "the first child is a...".   That being said, if we know the first child is a girl, then out of bb, bg, gb, and gg, only gb, and gg are left available. Hence the probability is 1/2.   Had you phrased it like the OP ("if we have a family with one girl (not necessarily the first child), what is the probability that both are girls?"), then your answer would be correct. – Nemi  Dec 21 '10 at 18:06         2      Yes, @Nemi is correct - I think the OP has stated the question such that gb and bg are the same thing. – Maxim Zaslavsky  Dec 21 '10 at 20:12        4      @Nemi You are correct that there is an important distinction between "one of the two children is a girl" and "the first child is a girl". My text says: "Since we are given that at least one child is a girl there are three possibilities: bg, gb, or gg". I did not say that we are given that the first child is a girl. The three possibilities arise from considering whether the first/second born was a girl/boy. – Travis Service  Dec 21 '10 at 20:29            sorry, re-reading your answer now I see that you have stated it correctly.

Of course this is not unique to English, and I think you should be able to find similar similar puzzles in pretty much any natural language.  Here is an example that brings out the difficulty more clearly.  First, consider the following similar puzzle:   A family has two children, Robin and Lindsay. Lindsay is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   In elementary probability class, they teach you to answer this by making a table of the four options  Robin    Lindsay
  B        B
* B        G
  G        B
* G        G  The starred rows are the ones where Lindsay is a girl, and we compute from them that the chance that both children are girls is 1/2.  Now consider this puzzle   A family has two children, Robin and Lindsay. At least one of them is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   The elementary probability method gives the following table, and a probability of 1/3.  The difference is that we gain one more row, compared to the previous puzzle.  Robin    Lindsay
  B        B
* B        G
* G        B
* G        G  After looking at these, you can see that the difficulty of the original puzzle comes because, in English, "one of the children" can mean several different things:   "one" can mean "a particular one". If you read the original puzzle like this, it becomes analogous to the first puzzle I wrote, and the answer will be 1/2.  "one" can mean "at least one". If you read the original puzzle like this, it become analogous to the second puzzle I wrote, and the answer is 1/3.  "one" can mean "exactly one". If you read the original puzzle like this, the answer is 0.   There is a common convention in mathematics that "one" usually means "at least one". For example, this is the sense intended in the following sentence, which is a typical example of mathematical English: "if a natural number $n$ is a multiple of a prime number $p$, and $n = ab$, then one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by $p$."  We would not read this as saying that exactly one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by $p$.  I don't believe this convention is very common in non-mathematical English. If I say, "one of my children is a girl", in normal English this means that the other is a boy. Similar discrepancies between mathematical and non-mathematical English come up with our use of the word "or" and our use of the phrase "if/then".  When we teach mathematics, we have to spend time explaining this mathematical argot to students, so they can use the same English conventions that we do.  Probability puzzles like the one you're asking about rely on these differences of English meaning, rather than on any logical or mathematical problem.  In that sense, they aren't really puzzles, they're just tricks.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 23 '10 at 15:47       Carl Mummert   61.2k 7 116 227                  I now, at last, agree that the correct answer is 1/3. (See my question "2 slightly different situations in which 2 coins are tossed.

In my case I wasn't tricked -- I immediately assumed that "one of my children is a girl" meant that "at least one of my children is a girl". – NotSuper  Dec 27 '10 at 16:30            (continued) I assumed this because to interpret "one of my children is a girl" as meaning "exactly one of my children is a girl" would destroy the problem/puzzle in that the answer would be too obviously zero. Also, because I had first seen the question in a book about randomness and probability, I was already in math English mode. – NotSuper  Dec 27 '10 at 16:30            @NotSuper: Thanks for your kind comments. – Carl Mummert  Dec 28 '10 at 3:07        2      Should be the accepted answer. – 355durch113  Oct 17 '15 at 3:58        add a comment |             up vote  21  down vote      Please ignore the old comments - I have radically changed my answer .  It's long, but bear with me - after reading this answer, you should feel intuitively-comfortable with almost all other probabilistic fallacies, not just this one.  The first and most important thing is to define what we mean by "probability."  Let's define it to mean "the expected percentage of positive outcomes when repeating an observation over a large sample"  (Go ahead, read that again, more slowly) .  Also, let's call the method we use to chose this large sample the "model."  This may sound trivial, but it has some important implications.  For example, what is the probability you will die before age 40?  According to our definition, this question has no meaning:  we can't observe you multiple times before age forty and record how many times you die.  Instead, we observe other people below age 40, and record how many of them die.  So let's say we observe all other people on earth below age 40 (our model), and find that 1/2 of them die before hitting the big four-oh.  Does this mean the probability of you dying before 40 is 50%?  Well, according to this model, it does!  However, this is hardly a fair model.  Perhaps you live in a first-world country - now when we revise our model to include only people below 40 in first-world countries, your chances become a much-less-grim 1/10 † .  But you are also not a smoker, and don't live in the city, and ride your bike on Sundays with your wife and crazy mother-in-law, which makes your chances 123/4567!  That's much better... however, our model still doesn't take into account that you are also an avid skydiver ;)  † I am pulling these numbers out of nowhere, they are not real statistics.  So the point is, asking for a "probability" only makes sense in the context of a certain model - a way of repeating our observation many times.  Without that, asking for a probability is meaningless.   Now, back to the original question.  Before we can assign a probability, we must choose a model; how are we choosing the families to sample from?  I see two obvious choices, which will lead to different answers:   Consider only families which have two children, one of whom is a girl, and choose one randomly.  Consider only girls who have exactly one sibling, and choose one randomly.   Do you see the difference?  In the first case, every family has the same probability of being chosen.  However, in the second case, the families with two girls are more likely to be chosen than families with only one girl, because every girl has an equal chance of being chosen:  the two-girl families have doubled their odds by having two girls.  If children were raffle tickets, they would have bought two tickets while the one-girl families bought only one.  Thus, we should expect the probabilities in these two cases to be different.  Let's calculate them more rigorously (writing BG to mean "boy was born, then girl):   There are three equally probable family-types: BG , GB , and GG  ( BB was removed from consideration, because they have no girls) .  Since only one of the three has two girls, our chances of having two girls are 1/3 .  We have the same possibilities as above, but now GG is twice as likely as BG or GB .  Thus, the probabilities are GG: 2/4 , GB: 1/4 , and BG: 1/4 , meaning the probability of a girl-sibling is 2/4 = 1/2  (alternatively, we could have noted that there are only two equally-probable possibilities for the sibling:  boy or girl) .   Here lies the fallacy:  the model our intuition assumes is the second one, but the way the problem is worded strongly implies the first one.  When we think in terms of "randomly choosing a family (over a large number of families)," our intuition meshes perfectly with the result.   Let's take a look at another similar problem   In a family of two children, where the oldest child is a girl, what is the probability they are both girls?   Once again, I can see two different, plausible models for observing our random sample:   Consider only families with two children, the oldest of whom is a girl, and choose one randomly.  Consider only girls who have exactly one (younger) sibling, and choose one at random.   So once again, the question strongly implies the first model, though arguments for either could be made.  However, when we actually calculate the probability...   Same as before, but we've also eliminated BG , where the first child was a boy.  This leaves only two equally-probable possibilities, GB and GG .  Thus, the chances are 1/2 .  We've also eliminated BG from this case, leaving GB and GG .  However, unlike the original question, GG is no longer twice as likely, since the younger child can no longer be the one who was randomly chosen.  Thus, GB and GG are equally likely, and we again have a probability of 1/2  (alternatively, we could have noted that there are only two equally-probable possibilities for the sibling:  boy or girl) .   ...we find that the choice between these two models doesn't matter, because in this case both have the same probability!  Among two-child families with an older daughter, it doesn't matter if we randomly choose the family or the older-daughter, because in both cases there is only one of each per family.   Hopefully that all made sense.  For bonus points, try applying this reasoning to the Monty Hall problem.  What is our model - how are we making repeated observations?  Why does it clash with our intuition?  For even more bonus points, try to figure out the following question; the math isn't too difficult, but it took me a long while to figure out why, intuitively, the answer should be correct:   In a family of two children, one of whom is a girl named Florida, what are the chances of two girls?   (If you have troubles, post a question and leave a link to it in the comments, and I'll try to answer it there as best I can :) )     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 31 '14 at 16:57             answered Dec 21 '10 at 18:36       BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft   5,225 3 26 42              4      I don't completely agree with this analysis. Mathematically, there is no problem at all. Once we list the possible events and the favorable events, the probability is just the corresponding fraction. So the difficulty in these puzzles is just that English hasn't evolved a clear way to describe a probability space. There are two reasonable probability spaces here, and usual English is not clear about which of them is intended. But regardless what anyone knows about the children, I can still compute the probabilities in both these spaces, to get 1/3 and 1/2, respectively. – Carl Mummert  Dec 23 '10 at 15:06             @Carl: Then you must believe that the Monty Hall problem is ambiguous in exactly the same way, no?  I'm afraid I have to disagree with that. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Dec 23 '10 at 17:15         2      I do feel that the difficulty in the Monty Hall problem is also not "mathematical", in the sense that as soon as any probability model has been rigorously stated then the probabilities can be calculated using basic methods. The arguments about the Monty Hall problem stem from a lack of rigour in the statement, which I think is often intentional in order to make an otherwise easy probability exercise into a "puzzle". – Carl Mummert  Dec 23 '10 at 17:44            @Carl: In both cases, it's not that it's ambiguous or not mathematically-defined, it's just counter-intuitive. – BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft  Dec 23 '10 at 21:29        2      The two puzzles are similar, and you've made a nice comparison.  They each have two simple probability models, and it's clear which gives the clever, counter-intuitive solution.  But if you admit any more complexity, there's a lot of ambiguity in both problems.  For example, given a room full of people convinced that switching doors is the right strategy, an adversarial Monty Hall can make sure no one wins by offering the switch only to those who first choose the car.  In real life, I would assume ratings and TV gimmicks affect what choices I'm given, and I have no probability model for that! – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 23 '10 at 23:04        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  10  down vote      Here's some idea.  Suppose you sample $4n$ families with two children, where $n$ is a very large integer. Then, with a very high probability, about $n$ of them have two boys, about $n$ have two girls, and about $2n$ have one girl and one boy.
Since you ignore the families with two boys, the desired probability is given by $n/(3n) = 1/3$.  EDIT: The above solution corresponds to the following situation. You visit a large number of families. In each family, you check if there are two kids. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you check if one of the kids is a girl. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you check if both kids are girls.  EDIT: Among all the OP's examples, only one is relevant here. Namely, "I visit this family. I know they have 2 kids. One of them, a girl, comes into the room. The probability that the 2nd kid is also a girl is 1/2, no?". Well, in this situation the probability is indeed $1/2$, assuming the following interpretation. You visit a large number of families. In each family, you check if there are two kids. If no, you ignore this family. If yes, you wait until one of the kids comes into the room. If it is a boy, you ignore this family; otherwise you check if both kids are girls. It is readily understood that this leads to a probability of $1/2$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 21 '10 at 13:52             answered Dec 21 '10 at 12:47       Shai Covo   20.7k 1 27 52              4      Of course, a lot depends on how we interpret the question. – Shai Covo  Dec 21 '10 at 12:52        1      @NotSuper: It all depends a lot on the precise formulation, as Shai already pointed out. Let's say you visit a friend who flips a coin twice. Given that at least one of the outcomes is Heads, the probability of two Heads is indeed 1/3. – Hendrik Vogt  Dec 21 '10 at 13:35        1      @NotSuper: Shai is right indeed: You can see only one of them , say the one closer to you, and it's a head. So you know more than in the experiment I formulated. In that experiment, I assumed that you know that at least one of the two outcomes is Heads, but if it's only one head, then you don't know which coin it is! In your experiment you know that that coin lying closer to you is a head, so it's a different experiment. – Hendrik Vogt  Dec 21 '10 at 15:38         1      @NotSuper: I understand that this is a bit difficult. Let me put my experiment in different words: When I write "Given that at least one of the outcomes is Heads", then this means: someone looked at both coins and provided you with the information that one of the outcomes is Heads. In your experiment, you look only at one of the coins. – Hendrik Vogt  Dec 21 '10 at 17:46        1      @NotSuper: No. Looking at only one coin and looking a two coins gives different knowledge.

(The original question is a little ambiguous, but I agree that 1/3 is the best answer.)  The marble example and the example of the firstborn daughter are the same situation-- the second trial is independent, and the odds are 1/2.  In these cases you know the first trial is independent, and you can ignore it.  The original question intends you to imagine a randomly chosen 2 child family from among all families with at least 1 daughter.  For example, suppose there is a social science study on 2 child families with at least 1 daughter-- in this situation, about 1/3 of the families will be daughter-daughter, 1/3 will be daughter-son, and 1/3 will be son-daughter.  You have to consider the full probability space of two trials (d-d,d-s,s-d,s-s) and eliminate the s-s possibility.  This leaves a 1/3 chance of 2 daughters.  For other variations on this question, you have to decide the appropriate probability space before answering.  (One common, confusing variation is to suppose the family has two children, one of which is a son born on a Tuesday-- what are the odds of two sons?)  In your example where the first child in the room is a daughter, if we suppose that the order the children enter has nothing to do with sex, then the probability the other child is a daughter is 1/2.  However, maybe the family encourages their daughters to play inside and their sons outside-- then you could assume the other child is a son, since he hasn't come in yet.  Maybe the culture has a tradition that the oldest daughter in the household (if there is a daughter) offers guests drinks-- then you know the family has at least one daughter, and the odds that they have another daughter is 1/3.  Once you've chosen your assumptions, you can define the probability space and compute the answer.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 21 '10 at 14:03       Jonas Kibelbek   5,049 1 21 28              1      @Jonas  It isn't at all clear that "The original question intends you to imagine a randomly chosen 2 child family from among all families with at least 1 daughter." Instead I imagined I hadn't seen my nephew in a decade, and we hadn't kept in touch. But I had heard that he had 2 kids and one was a girl. I was going to visit him soon and was wondering about the other child. Girl? or boy? I figured the chances of a girl was 1 in 2, and I still do. I found the Wikipedia article linked to by Rawling enlightening. – NotSuper  Dec 21 '10 at 15:15             @NotSuper: Yes, I agree it's ambiguous.  It is clear that I gave Mlodinow's intended interpretation only because he gave the answer 1/3.  But your nephew scenario is ambiguous as well-- how did you hear that one child is a girl?  You could learn that among their children is at least one daughter (maybe they send an old dollhouse to your grandchildren), which gives 1/3.  Or, you could specify one of their children (oldest, first to answer the phone, etc., as long as it's independent of sex) and learn she is a girl, which gives 1/2. – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 21 '10 at 15:42            These correspond to the two probability spaces described in my answer and in the Wikipedia article.  When you hear that one child is a girl, can you cross off son-son and son-daughter, or can you just cross off son-son?  (With other information and messier probability models, we could get other answers than 1/2 and 1/3 as well.  But these are the two most sensible models to apply.) – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 21 '10 at 15:46             @Jonas "How did you hear that one child is a girl?" I wrote "I had heard that he had 2 kids and one was a girl." I think that implies that someone told me that (or possibly wrote that to me in a letter or email), and that's all I know about my nephew's children. Isn't that the standard interpretation? – NotSuper  Dec 24 '10 at 13:34             @NotSuper: To quote from Carl's answer, "one child" can be interpreted several ways in English: "one particular child," "at least one child," or "exactly one child."  If the letter or e-mail gives you enough context to pick one interpretation, then it's easy to compute the probability.  Your intuitive answer of 1/2 is a correct answer, provided you recognize you are using the "one particular child" interpretation.  But, since this is a puzzle or riddle, the smallest assumption ("at least one child"), which gives the counter-intuitive answer, is the riddler's preferred answer.  Do you agree? – Jonas Kibelbek  Dec 24 '10 at 16:34        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  2  down vote      This is really a continuation of BlueRaja's answer, where I'm changing the question slightly to give another illustration of the underlying point.  Consider the following two procedures:  Procedure A: I flip two coins, a nickel and a penny.  After the flip, I
pick one at random, and report its value to you.  Procedure B: I flip two coins, a nickel and a penny.  If exactly one lands
heads, I report that one's value to you, i.e. I say either "the nickel
landed heads" or "the penny landed heads" as appropriate.  If both land
heads, I report on one of them chosen at random.  If neither lands
heads, I say "both landed tails."  Now, if I follow Procedure A and say "the nickel landed
heads", then the probability that the penny landed heads is 50/50.  But
if I say the very same thing after following Procedure B, the
probability that the penny landed heads is 1 in 3.  Now take the following problem:  I flip two coins and say to you "the
nickel landed heads".  What is the probability that the penny landed
heads? Clearly there's no way to answer without knowing or assuming something about the procedure I'm following.  (All this having been said, I agree that the best answer to the original question is 1/3.)     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 22 '10 at 22:47       Larry Denenberg   656 3 10              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?  0%.

In this case we are given that one or both of the children is a girl, but not given any information about which one(s) -- so a simple evaluation of the 4 possible scenarios (for a two-child family) reveals the answer of 33%.  The confusion stems from the slightly ambiguous language used.  The phrase one of the children was used to mean one or both of the children .  Based on that language, our brains trick us into thinking that a specific  one of the children is given and therefore we can evaluate the other child independently.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 6 '13 at 4:24       nobar   101 2                  A link to this Wikipedia article was given in the main comments, but I wanted to point out that the article addresses the psychology of this problem , in an attempt to expose the seeming "paradox" of common intuition. – nobar  May 13 '13 at 2:20             youtu.be/be2wuOaglFY?t=37m0s "This problem is famous for being ill-posed." – nobar  Mar 3 '17 at 1:43            There is some ambiguity about whether I should have said "4 possible scenarios" or "3 possible scenarios". – nobar  Mar 3 '17 at 1:46        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Let $X$ be the event "one of the children is a girl" Let $BG$ refer to the event the family has one boy and one girl (I'm not distinguishing $BG$ and $GB$), and so forth. Everything is conditioned on the family having two children.  $$ P(GG | X) = \frac{P(GG \wedge X)}{P(X)} 
= \frac{P(X|GG) P(GG)}{P(X|GG) P(GG) + P(X|BG)P(BG) + P(X|BB)P(BB)}

1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + P(X|BG) \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}}

$$  (note that I am assuming this isn't taken as a "trick" question, so that $P(X|GG) = 1$ is meant, rather than $P(X|GG)=0$)  So everything boils down to the probability of "one of the children is a girl" given that the family has a boy and a girl.  Now, what does the phrase "one of the children is a girl" mean? There are two typical options   This phrase simply means that this is not an all-boy family. In this case, $P(X|BG) = 1$, and $P(GG|X) = 1/3$.  The phrase means that a particular child was chosen and it could just has easily have been the boy, so that $P(X|BG) = 1/2$, and $P(GG|X) = 1/2$.   In my opinion, an English speaker would almost always interpret the phrase the first way rather than the second way.  However, there is a nasty linguistic trap: even meaning it the first way, we may often pick a girl to be the referent of "one" (e.g. so that we can speak of the "other" child). And since we've picked a girl, we get stuck in the second interpretation. This is exacerbated by the fact the second interpretation has a very appealing shortcut for reasoning out the solution.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 17 '15 at 3:51             answered Oct 17 '15 at 3:37       Hurkyl   102k 8 100 237              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      You have to read carefully.

girl".  Two of them lead to the 1/2 and 1/3 answers which have been discussed
at length, but I found only one brief
answer covering the third
interpretation (though I did only skim).  The meaning of the statement, and consequently the correct answer, can be
altered by considering it to answer different questions.   "How many of your children are girls?"  "One of my children is a girl."  "Is one of your children a girl?"  "Yes, one of my children is a girl."  "Is the child in the stroller a boy or a girl?"  "This one is a girl."   Suppose you've just had the first discussion; what do you think the other child
will be in that case?  There is no chance the other is a girl.  The second question would prompt most people to search their set of children
for a girl and answer "yes" if they can find one or "no" otherwise.
Consequently, out of the 3/4 of two-child parents who can answer yes, about 1/3
of those will have another girl.  However it's conceivable that some kind of contrarian may resolve "one of your
children" even before they have considered the rest of the question, choosing
one at random regardless of its gender, and answering the rest of the question
with respect to that random choice.  This renders the situation equivalent to
the third case.  In the third case, obviously, the gender of the other child is independent of
all the information we have.  So it's a 1/2 chance.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:20       Community ♦   1        answered Feb 22 '17 at 18:54       sh1   117 2                  This is entirely incorrect.

I set $q=P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \mbox{He has $\{B,G\}$})$.  If you sample at family level, then you ask the father if he has at least a daughter or you check official records. In that case $q=1$.  If you sample at child level, by for instance meeting the father in the company of one child or otherwise happening to find out about one child, then $q=1/2$. In this case you will half the time miss this family because you happen to see the son first.  Using Bayes' formula, we get
$$
P(\{B,G\}) \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})
= \frac{P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{B,G\}) P(\{B,G\})}
{P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})}.
$$  Since
$$P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter}) = P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{B,G\}) P(\{B,G\}) + P(\mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter} \mid \{G, G\}) P(\{G, G\}),
$$  we get 
$$
P(\{B,G\} \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter}) = (q \times 1/2)/(q \times 1/2 + 1 \times 1/4) = 2q/(1 + 2q),
$$  and it follows that 
$$
P(\{G, G\} \mid \mbox{You say that he has at least one daughter})=1/(1 + 2q).
$$  If $q=1/2$, we get $P=1/2$, and $q=1$ gives $P=1/3$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 2 '17 at 18:23       Helmer.Aslaksen   21 2              add a comment |             up vote  -2  down vote      Ok let us consider the unknown. A couple has a girl child. The wife gets pregnant. What are the odds the second child will be a (girl) or (boy).  Now we have reduced the question to a single possibility set.
 the child will have x-x chromosomes
 The child will have x-y Chromosomes  The wife ONLY provides X chromosomes. The husband has the coin toss x or y.
As there is ONLY one coin being thrown (the second x or y in our fair coin toss) then the odds remain 50%. We are NOT Throwing two fair coins to find an answer in this case.  Given a fair coin, the odds are 50% of either outcome, period. We can now use this theory regardless of anything else when asking about the next occurrence (or unknown previous occurrence) as it is separate from any other occurrence and not related in any way. There are TWO options only.  You can stack all the "possibilities and probabilities" you want to, however we KNOW that given a coin toss the next toss has a 50% chance of either outcome. IT is ONLY in looking backward at "n" tosses and in the ORDER of results that any other probability exists and that does not apply to the next toss itself. Having tossed three Y's consecutively does not increase the odds of an X on the next toss, nor reduce it.  Where the first toss is unknown (the second child is a girl) then it still makes no difference...there is an xx, xy possibility genetically as to the first toss. Therefore 50% chance. Ignore english completely...look at the basic problem, unless you care about order or statistics of results over "n" tosses etc.  The ONLY way that one ever has a statistic of 
gg
gb
bg
bb  is when a fair coin is tossed n times and actually create the "expected" result given above. It is not possible to change the odds of "next throw" of a fair coin(s). Only to look backward to the odds that a specific result might be expected over n tosses in a specific order or not. We only have ONE toss involved (next or unknown previous toss) then there is only one possible answer, a 50% chance an x or y chromosome exists.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 26 '16 at 22:55       Djea3   1              add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      It's 1/2 as order is not important, just the physical combination.  i.e. BG == GB.

I dont see any ambiguity with this question. Clearly, the OP, didnt specify the position of the first girl. Even if the OP, asked "...if the Eldest is a girl, that both children are girls?" and we have to include the 'order' of the genders in determining the probability of the 2nd child the answer is still 1/2.  General basis...that there's a 50% chance that the 2nd child is either a boy or a girl(gender is an independent event). Therefore, (ignoring reality that the ratio of boys and girls is skewed in favor of girls) its distribution within a population (multiple events) is equally, half boys and half girls, for the second child.  Proof of this is by looking at genetics. Males, carries the xy chromosomes and xx for the females.  A child can be either xx or xy.  In a family of 2 children then the distribution of chromosomes would be the following combination...  xx xx (all girls) xy xy (all boys) xx xy (a girl and a boy)  *note the 3rd combination, it's not order specific, which also represent the combination xy xx  It's given that one child is a girl therefore we can remove the combination xy xy. We end up with only 2 combination, one of the combination is xx xx (all girls) therefore the chance of that happening is 1/2.  If we have to be specific with the gender order then our combination would be...  xx xx xy xy xx xy xy xx  and "...if the Eldest is a girl..."  a) one child is a girl therefore we can remove the xy xy combination  b) eldest is a girl therefore we can remove the xy xx combination (boy is older)  which leaves us with the following combination....  xx xy xx xx  clearly 1/2  Why 1/3 is wrong...  The original assumption is that there are 4 combinations as oppose to 3. The 4 combinations only applies if the order is specified either the eldest or the youngest.  If the known girl is the eldest then the combination BG has to be excluded for consideration.  If the known girl is the youngest then the combination GB has to be excluded for consideration.  The 1/3 proponent assume that there is no order and represented the boy and girl combination both ways instead of one. Or, there is order but neglected to remove the combination that doesnt represent the actual position of the known girl.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 21 '13 at 8:30             answered Dec 21 '13 at 8:22       nick   1 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

These are the statistics of the likelihood of having one gender over another after studying over 6,000 families that have over 12,000 children between them. This a more thorough study than most the ones I see on much more important issues (like circumcising or delayed vaccinations) so I thought it was pretty cool.  If anyone was confused and thinks you should start painting the nursery after reading these statistics, that's not true!! They are just the odds that other families have shown.  I think it is really interesting that families of 1, 3, or 4+ girls has a greater than 50% chance of having a boy, but with a family with 2 girls, the chance of a boy is slightly lower than 50%. Statistics are interesting not the rule    --  **Alyssa** Rockin' Mom to  Julia  (3.13.04) and Maribel  (3.06.08) and  TTC Our Last Punk              Reply            Report this comment       0               / 2      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

Policebaby#3    Last edited 02/17/2014        What are the odds of having all children of the same sex?  And when I ask this, I mean 3 or more.  I think the odds are astronomical to have all of your children the same sex when it comes to 3 or more.  It is a theory I have and was curious to what others thought.  If you think about it, you have a 50/50 shot.  I know of people who have 5 boys, some who have 4 girls..I find it hard to believe that 50/50 shot deal because how can you have that luck each and every time that you produce only boys or only girls?  I honestly think there could be a possibility that some men cannot produce the opposite sex sperm (X or Y) or that the woman's body kills off the opposite sex sperm.  I am sure this is hogwash, but it gets me thinking.  My friend has all girls, 3.  My uncle has 2 boys from a prior marriage and now 2 boys from his new marriage.  I know XY sperm (boy) swim faster and if you time it just right they will get their first and it could just happen the deed is done right at the time they will get to the egg but this would have had to have been done each time....however I just think the odds are very high.  I honestly thought I my body rejected female sperm until I got pregnant with a girl this time but I know many people who have a few children or more and they are all boys or all girls.  Any thoughts on this or am I just bored and thinking too deep about it?  Be honest I would love to hear other thoughts on this.  It is always something that intrigued me.

With any given preg., the odds are 50/50.  So, odds of having a girl with one preg = 1 in 2.  1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4, so the odds of having all girls with 2 kids is 1 in 4.  1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8, so the odds of having all girls with 3 kids is 1 in 8.  1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/16, so the odds of having all girls with 4 kids is 1 in 16.

Report this comment        7                  corbinator   Posted 05/09/2010      The odds are 50/50 because you only have two choices, boy or girl, like heads or tails. And since each pregnancy is independent, the chance is still 50/50 no matter how many of one gender you've had in any specific order. And I am pretty sure you are right, the sperm theory is hogwash. It's just nature. Everyone's different so even if the sperm theory was accepted, we're creating new beings all the time and the data could never keep up with every single fertile couple on Earth to prove it wrong. We just have to let it take it's course.                       Report this comment        1                     AshR822    Posted 05/09/2010      I know two different families with five girls each.

I had two miscarriages before I had my youngest son and I know that one was a girl, so I guess I know its possible. I kept thinking that if the other baby was a girl, maybe I can't carry them because a month after the last miscarriage I got pregnant with my youngest son. Anyway, I don't mind having another boy as long as he is healthy,but I always think about having my little girl someday!     --  Proud mama to 3 boys: Darrain 11/26/2003 , Damire' 11/14/2004, Braylon 9/26/2009, and Cameron 3/12/2012!!

Never tried it, but most the time we dtd was days before ovulation. (can see why we have girls)I was actually doing family planning and the the only times were day 9 and day18. That makes it 4-5 days before ovulation or after.

Tuesday, November 08, 2016  Are large families of the same gender a statistical fluke? Mother of four sons, Gwen Loughman goes behind the myths In 1970’s Ireland, families with six or more children were the norm. CSO figures almost five decades later however, sees numbers for such families drop from 15,000 to a mere 3,000. Having four children in 21st century Ireland is considered a large family but to have more, and for those children to be all of the same gender, is a rarity and an attraction in itself.  Myths about how to conceive a girl or boy child have been around for centuries. During the reign of King Henry VIII it was widely believed the responsibility to produce the desired male gender fell to the female. Science has since proven otherwise.  Therese Murphy, lecturer in Medical Sciences, University of Exeter clears up just who determines the baby’s gender. “A baby’s genetic sex is determined by the man’s sperm as the sperm cell will contain either an X or a Y chromosome. It is the Y chromosome that is essential for the development of the male reproductive organs. When a Y chromosome is not present an embryo will develop into a female.”  Sex ratio  Carmel Kennedy, Ballyphehane, Cork with her eight sons. Carmel Kennedy from Ballyphehane, Cork with eight sons aged 37 to 20 is no stranger to people passing comments about her brood over the years. “I could talk for hours about some of the things people said. I did have girls but did not go to term with them. I always wanted a large family; I’m one of six girls and four boys and we had a beautiful childhood. Now I have eight healthy, respectful sons and lovely grand-daughters of my own,” she says. Professor Louise Kenny from Cork University Maternity Hospital Perinatal Medicine says in general, worldwide, slightly more boys are born than girls. “If left to nature there will be about 105 boys born for every 100 girls. However, 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 107 boys born for every 100 girls, largely driven by the skewed ratio caused by sex selection prior to birth in China, where about 118 boys are born for every 100 girls.” Statistical coincidence? Michelle Masterson Power and husband David have four daughters aged eight to 14. Their sons are six and four. “Because we were used to being parents of just girls, it meant we didn’t know any differently. David grew up with five sisters and one brother so he was very comfortable being a father of daughters. But once the boys came along, we learned the truth in that old saying, boys wreck the house. That one is so true! “ Michelle says her house was a very different one before the boys arrived. “It was very girly. Civilised, I’d say.” Michelle Masterson Power and Cillian, Orlagh, Ciarán, Eimear, Aoife, Ailbhe, Masterson Power. Naturally, there was great excitement when Cillian arrived, creating a particular interest in nappy changes! “The girls each took turns holding him and I had to time them! They were amazed when he wee’d all over me one day.” The odds of having a girl or a boy are the same with a one in two chance of it being one or the other. 50/50 if you like. However, what about bigger families of the same gender; are they a statistical coincidence? Dr Murphy again: “The probability of having a boy or a girl from a genetics point of view, remain the same each time a baby is conceived. However, there is some epidemiological evidence to suggest other factors may influence sex determination in humans. There is an argument about the motility and/ or survival of Y-carrying sperm and X-carrying sperm and timing of ovulation but it’s important to note that there are no robust ‘biological’ explanations for their observations to date.” There are various techniques and methods that allegedly improve the chances of conceiving a girl or a boy such as The Shettles Method and The Whelan Methods. Not forgetting particular diets and the slightly even more dubious practice of female douching. All have their believers and sceptics. Professor Louise Kenny has this to say. “In a nutshell there is no evidence that timing of intercourse affects sex ratio. There are several scientific studies that have disproven this. Furthermore, there is evidence that limiting intercourse within the fertile time will reduce your chances of getting pregnant at all. So my advice to couples would be to accept that at every conception there is approximately a 50:50 chance of conceiving a child of either sex and there’s very little than can be done to materially alter this,” she says. Historically speaking, there were massive gender divides. Concerns such as providing dowries for daughters and the birth of a male heir guaranteeing property retention saw one gender being preferred over the other. Thankfully, times have changed and when it comes to large families, issues like privacy and parental support are more relevant. Gwen Loughman with her sons Liam, Conor, Brendan, and Iarla. Carmel Kennedy had her own alternative support system in place when her boys were younger. “My sisters and I were there for each other and my sons had lots of friends and were always out playing so we mums would all stand at our gates and keep an eye on the kids. My coffee mornings were a cup of tea at the gate! And at night we called to each other’s houses.” She would agree being surrounded by menfolk meant privacy was limited. “I didn’t have any, I suppose. It’s only in the last seven years I have had my own bedroom space really as I always had a child or two asleep in my room. When they were babies and I was trying to shower, they used to scream at the door till I finished,” she says. Konrad, 26, is Carmel’s sixth-born and says life with seven brothers was for him just normal but, “for an outsider looking in it must have looked mental. It was never a silent house. We were all into music so it was loud and with eight boys comes a tonne of friends so people were always in and out. My mother was very relaxed. I think she likes the noise. I think we all turned out fairly well. We know now it was tough for my mother. But she never let it show,” he says. The teenage years are on the horizon for the Masterson Power family but Michelle is a woman of little or no fear. She feels can handle the mood swings and teenage dramas thanks to her daughters. “The girls are great with their brothers. They are very much the bosses but are also quite tolerable as the boys are much more demanding physically. Their dad grew up with sisters and has a great understanding of girls particularly in the teenage years, I think the boys will be the same.” Michelle and David encourage their children to have the same values as their parents when they grow up. “I tell the girls to find a man like their dad.”   © Irish Examiner Ltd.

  heterozygous for a simple Mendelian autosomal gene alpha have a child, the probability 
  that the child will show the dominant phenotype is 3/4. Let's ask
  a somewhat more complex question. If this couple has a total of four children, 
  what is the probability that 3 of the 4 will show the dominant phenotype? To 
  answer this, we will first derive the appropriate formula and then use it to 
  calculate the numerical answer. The same formula allows us to understand the 
  expected statistical distribution of the various possible phenotype patterns 
  in four-child ( or any other size) families in a large population.    1. Review: How can some simple overall probabilities be calculated 
  by combining the multiplication and addition "rules" we covered earlier?  Let's start with a very simple case: asking about gender probabilities in families 
  of three children.  What is the probability that all three children in a family will be the same 
  gender? P(all female)= 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all male ) = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all one gender) = P(all female) + P(all male) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4  What is the probability that a three-child family is two girls and one boy? Each possible birth order has P=1/8. That is, P(G,G,B)=P(G,B,G)=P(B,G,G)=1/8. So, P(2G,1B)= 3/8 and P(1G,2B)= 3/8.  This allows us to write the overall gender probability distribution for families 
  of three children as follows: 1/8 will be three girls 3/8 will be two girls and one boy 3/8 will be one girl and two boys 1/8 will be three boys Adding it all up, we have 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 1 (100%)     2. How can we understand and use "Pascal's triangle" 
  and the "general rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities", 
  formula 1 (page 161 in textbook)?  Consider the numerators of the fractions in the above three-child family gender 
  equation: 1 , 3 , 3 , 1. These numbers are the coefficients in the expansion of the term 
  (p + q) cubed. In general, the coefficients of any such binomial expansion { the 
  term (p+q) raised to any power} give the "number of ways" that something 
  can happen.  Figure 4.21, "Pascal's triangle", shows these coefficients for the expansion 
  of (p + q) raised to any power up to 10. The numbers in any row can be used 
  just as described above. For example, assume that over the next two decades 
  you have 6 kids. There are 64 possible gender birth orders, with 20 of these 
  resulting in you having three girls and three boys.  The terms p and q are the individual probabilities for a specific outcome from 
  a single "event". For "gender" calculations, the probabilities p and 
  q are equal, both = 1/2 (the equal probabilities of male and female births).  For "dominant : recessive phenotype" type of calculations, p and q will usually 
  not be equal. For a simple Mendelian inheritance from two heterozygotic parents, 
  p will = 3/4 (if AA and Aa give dominant phenotype) and q will 
  = 1/4 ( aa gives recessive phenotype).  Generalizing this, we get to the formula on page 161 in your text that is "the general 
  rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities". The term (n!/s!t!) 
  is the number of possible ways (orders) of getting a certain net outcome ( "a 
  total of n ; with s of one and t of the other"). This 
  number can either be calculated or taken directly from Pascal's triangle.    3. Sample problem: You and your mate are both heterozygous 
  for some simple Mendelian gene alpha (i.e., each of you has genotype Aa , and both of you show the dominant phenotype) on chromosome #1. Over 
  the next decade, you proceed to have four children. What is the probability 
  that 3 of your children will show the dominant phenotype and one will show the 
  recessive phenotype? What are the probabilities of the other possible outcomes?  If we were looking at thousands of such families, we know that the overall ratio 
  of dominant to recessive phenotypes in the children would average out to 3:1, 
  as shown by a simple Punnett square. But for one couple having four children, 
  what's the probability, P(3D,1r)?  To calculate P(3D,1r), we use formula 1 for the case n=4, s=3, t=1, p=3/4, 
  q=1/4. P(3D,1r)= 4!/3! x (3/4)cubed x (1/4) = 4 x (27/64) x 1/4 = .42 ( 42% )  By also calculating the other four possibilities, we can construct a graph that shows the statistical distribution you would expect 
  to see in a large population.      Problem S-4: "Heterozygous parents; have three children".  Modify the sample problem above to do the calculations for you and your mate (both Aa ) having THREE children. Do the calculations for the probabilities that all three, two, one, or none of the three children will show the dominant phenotype from gene alpha . Construct the graph and compare the result with the "four children" graph done in class.

It's in your genes, dad  By Fiona Macrae for the Daily Mail    Updated: 18:28 EDT, 10 December 2008                     View comments          The 'fatherhood gene': Researchers claim a man's chances of having a boy or a girl are decided by his genes  A man's chances of fathering a boy or a girl are written in his genes, research suggests.   Analysis of more than 900 family trees dating back to 1600 has suggested the existence of a ' fatherhood gene' that determines the sex of a man's children.   As men inherit the gene from their parents, males who have lots of brothers are likely to have sons and those with many sisters have high odds of fathering daughters. Corry Gellatly, a research scientist at Newcastle University, analysed the histories of 927 European and American families, comprising more than 500,000 people. The results suggested that a gene controls whether a man's sperm contains more X or Y chromosomes, which in turn determine the sex of his children. A child's sex is determined by the father because a woman's eggs only contain X chromosomes. When one of these combines with a sperm carrying an X chromosome, a girl is created. If it combines with a Y, the result is a boy.    It is thought that the gene comes in three forms. Men that inherit the first produce more Y sperm and have more sons. Those with the second-type produce equal numbers of X and Y sperm and so are as likely to have a boy as a girl. The third form skews the tendency towards daughters, the journal Evolutionary Biology reports. Mr Gellatly said the simple system would help keep the number of boys and girls born roughly equal. He said: 'If there are too many males in the population, for example, females will more easily find a mate, so men who have more daughters will pass on more of their genes, causing more females to be born in later generations.' The theory could also explain why shortly after the First World War an extra two boys were born for every 100 girls in the UK compared with before. Mr Gellatly said the odds were in favour of men with more sons seeing a son return from the war.  The soldiers would have inherited the tendency to have sons and so be more likely to father boys themselves. By contrast, men with more daughters may have lost their only sons in the war.

Anyway, just wondering if you did something different to increase your chances of having a girl? Also, how was your pregnancy different from with your boys. My hubby and I didn't do anything to "try" and get a girl. In fact, this baby was not planned at all. It was a ONE time "whoopsie" and I was shocked when I got a positive pregnancy test. Anyway, my symptoms are kind of different. I started feeling really nauseous super early (a little over 4 wks) and it also starts from the time I wake up. It was always later in the day with my first four pregnancies. I don't know what I'm trying to do by asking y'all this. It's not going to change anything ;-) Just curious, I guess. I really do think it's going to be another boy. Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  71 Posts T  TEWhatley I am pregnant with my 5th after four boys. We will find out Wednesday what this one is, but like you I am anticipating another boy. I feel like this pregnancy was a little different with nausea and such, but I think I get my hopes up a little each time thinking it is different:-). Good luck! I know many would disagree that it is silly to have gender disappointment, but it happens for me. I have always dreamed of having that mother/daughter bond, but once my boys are born, I love them to death. We will see Wednesday. Reply  Close m  maui_luau Pregnant with #5 too. Another boy ;) 5 boys will be crazy Reply  Close s  sarahjcampbell Hi I am pregnant 15weeks and have four sons. This pregnancy like yours wasn't really planned was a surprise and a one of time but nether the less I'm so excited and happy. I'm also hoping for a little girl but will still love a son unconditionally. This pregnancy is different well for me, with the boys I was sick morning noon and night for almost 6mths. I would say this time around im sick of a night time only and sickness cleared up by 10weeks. Also heartbeat was 162 on Friday. Thinking like every mum of 4 boys there is still a little questioning and hope for a girl but I think deep down I'm carrying a boy and to be honest I would find it very difficult to believe it's a girl until she's here. I'm so used to boys haha. Roll on 20 weeks or until he/she is born :) :) Reply  Close n  nicoleprzy @TEWhatley  I feel the same as you. I would love a daughter but if it's a boy- I will still fall in love. I look forward to hearing what you are having!!

No girl yet thoe maybe next time Reply  Close S  SierraJ82 I can feel all your pain. Been there and done it many times. I have 5 boys...and sitting in my arms as I type this is my 7 week old baby girl!!! I know what it's like to love your boys with all your heart, but always feel a part of u missing without having a daughter. I am very close with my mom and felt like I would be missing something in life without a daughter to grow with. The beginning of this year I told my husband I wanted to "try" for one more. It may sound stupid but I got an app called GET BABY which keeps track of ur cycle as well as tells u when u ovulate and which days u r likEly to have a girl or a boy. Well it told me that my best chance for a girl was the day after my period finished which is exactly what I did. The one day...that's it. Then waited. ( obviously with 5 ..we've never had a problem getting pregnant. ..lol.) We'll the next month...boom...took pregnancy test and yes we were! Felt exactly like u ladies....prob would be another boy. I can say nausea was same as with boys...started around 6 weeks and gone at 12. The only thing that I personally noticed and let me say it was DRASTIC....I-was-exhausted. I would come home from work at 5 and fall asleep on the couch for hours...with 5 boys making noise all around me. I couldn't keep my eyes open. My husband luckily was very helpful and took over because he could see I just couldn't stay awake. I would wake up sometime around 11 or 12 and then just go straight to bed. I was like this until about 14 weeks and then slowly got more energy. But honestly that was the only difference for me and I remember laying on the couch falling asleep and saying to my husband...what is with me? I thought maybe because I was older.... ( this was my 1st baby in my 30's...all my boys were in my 20's) It crossed my mind for a sec that it could be a girl but I was scared to say it out loud. Lol. Sorry this is long...but I feel for you all.❤❤ That 1st ultrasound when they told me...I cried and cried... and cried all the way home...and ..all the way back to work. The next 4 months were a dream. Like I said she is 7 weeks now and has changed our house like nothing before. Watching my boys with her is soooo sweet and seeing my husband with her melts my heart. My shopping trips are filled with bags of pinks and purples...lol. she has more clothes already than any of her brothers ever did. Lol. Ladies...I wish you the best. I hope you all get a daughter to fill ur heart. There is nothing sweeter. And don't let anyone tell u that after you've had so many boys a girl is not possible. IT IS!!!! Good luck and best wishes!!!!! Reply  Close m  mjmccallop I just found out I am 4 weeks pregnant with my 5th. We already have 4 girls (20, 13, 4, and 2).

I had sex 3 days before I ovulated to get that girl! And that was it. 3 days before and not again until after ovulation was over.

I just couldn't believe it it took me 30min to get myself back so the tech could finish my ultrasound lol My tech also cried lol she hugged me at the end she said she was so happy and she was honored to share such wonderful news I had my 4th baby at the same OBGYN so the nurses and of course doctors knew me, funny thing is for my 4th I told my doctor ok I need to tie and burn these very fertile tubes lol my doctor said no one more I looked at him like what??, I signed the papers for the procedure but my midwifes where bombarded with other women giving birth at the same time as me So they told me they couldn't do it that day I would have to wait 2 extra days I said no! I will pass 3 years later in May 2015 I'm pregnant it was such a shock I thought ok well I guess I'm doing this again lol but I felt iffy because here I am in my 30's this time I did have moments where I was like I can't do this I felt so weak and I felt the worse ever I would take a bite of ANYTHING and I would throw up like I eat a full course meal lol sorry for TMI Finally came 5 months and I just couldn't believe it, I carry around my ultrasound of when we found out lol I look at it and shed tears because it's just hard to swallow I'm over excited of the day that will be "it's time" I'm currently 32 weeks and overwhelmed :-) Reply  Close h  hillfamily10 I am 9 wks today with # 7 ( maybe #8 ) I feel bigger then normal so maybe twins . Anyway I had 4 boys and then 2 girls. My first girl we had the tect put the gender pic in an envelope and we found out a few days later our whole church screamed when we heard girl I was in shock I thought for sure another boy lol our second girl was such a surprise. After this one no more surprises lol I am not finding out till birth this time which my husband isn't crazy about. The only thing I found different for us is my boys birth years were odd #s (05,07,09,11) and the girls were even (12,14) so maybe a girl this time too lol I did carry my boys in my ribs and my girls super low the whole time ;) Reply  Close n  nicoleprzy Had a 12 week 2 day ultrasound (along with my MaterniT21 test) and the tech told me BOY. He got a decent between the legs shot so I have no reason not to believe him. He said 80%. I am still processing it. I love this baby no matter what but just knowing I will never have a daughter makes me kinda sad. I will get confirmation when my test results come back in the next couple weeks. Reply  Close n  nicoleprzy @maui_luau  Found out #5 is a boy. How did you feel about finding out? I feel so guilty for feeling such disappointment. Reply  Close m  mzdmommy @nicoleprzy  I felt guilty after always hearing it's a boy for 4 times in a row!!! Lol But as I heard the words it's a girl I was in total shock i just still can't believe it sometimes hehehe But I am just great full to be able to have babies as I know some can't :-( Reply  Close T  Ttblessed2016 @nicoleprzy  V Reply  Close T  Ttblessed2016 @Ttblessed2016  I'm going through the same thing. Excepting my 3rd girl. Love them to death but wanted a boy to balance and give hubby a buddy since he's an only child. I felt like crap and cried for a day but the girls are so excited about having another sister that it's easing my disappointment. From what I hear it will disappear as soon as the baby is born. But those feelings are valid and are not wrong or bad. They are valid. Feel better!

Lucy6boys wrote: Hi, just wondering if anyone has any ideas of gender stats for di/di twins? eg, boy/girl higher chances than g/g or b/b? Thanks in advance Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  29 Posts F  FirstOneNov08 I read somewhere that B/G has a higher chance but I'm not sure at all. Will be following this as I know from my MatrrniT21 test I have at least one boy!! Would love the other to be a girl. L  Lucy6boys @FirstOneNov08  Hoping some ladies even just comment what there bundles of joy were. I have 4 boys already :) D  DoubleUnicornPoo Based on general statistics and assuming your di/di twins are fraternal (there's always a chance they are identical if they are same sex), each embryo has a 50% chance of being either gender. So you basically have 4 combos: A is a boy and B is a boy. A is a boy and B is a girl. A is a girl and B is a boy. A is a girl and B is a girl. Since the 2 middle combinations are the same, you basically have a 25% chance of boy/boy, 25% girl/girl and 50% chance of boy/girl. Again, this is assuming you have fraternal twins and using basic statistics. It's probably not exactly those numbers but close to it. j  jackster185 I know I've heard that chances are higher of b/g with di/di but I don't know the statistics either. Mine are b/g, we knew at least one was a boy from NIPT and found out the other was a girl at our 19w scan. Good luck! L  Lucy6boys @DoubleUnicornPoo  Thank you so much for explaining so simply. I am paying private on 16th dec so will find out then. Xx L  Lucy6boys @jackster185  That's great and I'm hoping I have maybe one girl in there, if not I will be a mummy of 6 boys :) R  Raenstoirm @DoubleUnicornPoo  This makes sense. I also have b/g. C  Crystal4432015 I'm having girl/girl di/di twins :) We were told if they were the same sex they could be identical but not as likely if di/di k  kittykat91981 I'm having di/di twins, two boys :-) And they are most likely fraternal but my OB and MFM still say there is a chance they could be identical. s  sawchuk @Lucy6boys  I am having di/di girls t  thejenchile I have b/g. j  jlo27916 @Lucy6boys  We read somewhere it goes like this: most common to least common- b/g, g/g frat, b/b frat, g/g identical, b/b identical s  seeyouinmarch @Lucy6boys  I'm 25 wks with g/b :) d  dmblair I am 20 weeks with b/g r  renata612phd @DoubleUnicornPoo  Love the scientific explanation! And it's spot on!! o  operationmiracle @DoubleUnicornPoo  I agree with your calculation. That's what we came up with too. And we're having b/g :) I was really really hoping for at least 1 girl. We calculated a 66.6% chance of having at least one girl: Not caring who is born first or second, out of 3 options: 2 boys 2 girls 1boy/1girl 2 of the 3 options have at least 1 girl (or 66.6% chance). S  Susef 29 weeks with b/g :-) D  DaisyVc 29 weeks with g/g!! =) m  mds41 @operationmiracle  you are closer to 75% chance of a girl based on simple2525 explanation of statistics which is correct.

NO!!! sxymom99 wrote: Ok. So I have 3 little boys, and I am 15wks,4days pregnant with number 4. I want a girl so bad!! But I just feel like it is another boy. Then I had a lady tell me at a restaurant the other day that I had less than a 1% chance of having a baby of a different gender after 3 of the same! Is this true? Has anyone else heard this? I will  love this baby regardless, but I burst in to tears when I heard that! I love my boys dearly and wouldn"t trade them for the world, so maybe it would be easier to just have another one, and it will just be an even 4 boys. LOL. Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  22 Posts 7  7XsBlessed @sxymom99  I had 5 boys before I had a little girl. B  BabyBump92101 It's a 50/50 chance every time. I have never heard that! Statistically speaking, you would actually have a better chance if a girl b/c the odds of boy 4/4 times is slimmer. For example, think about when you flip a coin. If u flip it four times, it is worse odds you would get the same side all four times. GL! :) 3  3crazybirds @sxymom99  My parents had three girls, a boy, then another girl. I think that woman was crazy! B  BeEspin Crazy crazy. And what a beezy for telling you such a thing! Especially if she knew you were hoping for a girl. Genders are 50/50! N  Navy-Mom05 @sxymom99  It is all in you SO's DNA. Who did thar woman think she is to tell you that? N  NYCmama2 @sxymom99  Where did this woman get her data from? I'm not British, but what she said is pure "rubbish" ;) K  Ketch24 @NYCmama2  I come from a large family- 10 of us. All biological and no twins. The first three are girls then a boy. Then two more girls and another boy, then three more girls LOL! So 8 girls and 2 boys. That lady was wacked! s  sxymom99 Thank you all for your support!! That makes me feel better! My sister had 3 boys before she got her girl, so I am still hopeful!! My boys are so attached to me!! It's funny cause my husband says he wants a girl so at least one will like him. LOL. W  Wife2jeff @sxymom99  I just took genetics and you have a 50/50 chance with each pregnancy. They are completely seporate events that are independent from one another. That lady must have not learned about probability. Lol. M  Motocrossmama It is totally 50/50!! Just because you have 3 boys doesn't mean you won't have a girl! I'm in the same situation with 3 boys and hoping for a girl as well. J  JSS2001 My SIL had 3 boys and then a girl, so it's totally possible, and one of my brothers had 2 boys and then a girl,- so it's totally possible to have the same of one gender and then have the other gender! 50/50 chance! l  lmm242s What a crazy lady!!! That's the most far fetched opinion ever. I do think it's 50/50 but timing of conception can also play a part. l  lmhartle @sxymom99  I know you've heard this tons already nut just another reassuring voice (sort of)... It's 50/50 for each. Now your husband's sperm does play a part as well as the pH of your vaginal canal at the time of cinception, but that is a bygone. That all said, I have two wonderful boys and just expected this to be a boy as well. My DH and I used to joke he must only make boys, but we just found out we are having a girl so it can happen. Good luck!! E  Estrella422 @sxymom99  Poster Trisha_w has 3 boys and posted in Oct 4 that she is having a girl. There's always a chance. My in laws have 4 boys and 4 grandsons. My FIL is sooo hoping for a girl. I did count days to make sure some X sperms would have a chance at the egg first. Guess we will see soon enough. M  MEaMOM2010 @sxymom99  I don't think the lady that told you that you had a less than 1% chance of having a girl is right.  However, I did read some research that shows that statistically, 51% of first babies are boys and 49% are girls.  If the first baby was a boy, then second babies were 52% boys and 48% girls.  Same for third babies.  However, women who had girls first were more likely to have a boy the second time also.  So basically, even though more women who had boys the first time also had boys the second and third times, after that there was no statisticly relevant difference.  Besides, a 52% chance of having a boy is definitely not 99% chance you're having a boy!  Good luck, because I know how you feel.  I only have one boy and I'm constantly praying I get my girl this time!!! m  mommy2coryell @sxymom99  Always 50/50 chance...sorry lady at the restaurant. Â LOL. Â My friend had three girls and is now almost due with her boy. Â Happens all the time (hey, not to everyone, but keep positive!). D  DrGnome @sxymom99  As everyone else has said, each pregnancy has a 50/50 chance for gender. The lady in the restaurant was ignorant and mean--why would you ever say that to a woman who just told you she is hoping for a girl?! M  MommyAllen2010 Actually, in-gender has the stats but ... The chance of have same sex gender after two is still 50 but then after three goes down to 25% and after four goes down to 12.6% and after five goes down to 6% and so on and so forth. So, that lady has no idea what she is talking about. If anything you have a greater chance of having a girl this go around! D  DrGnome @MommyAllen2010  The chance is 50/50 every single time. However, the chance of having 3 of the same gender in a row is 12.5%, and the chance of having 4 of the same gender in a row is 6%. The gender of children you already have doesn't influence every new pregnancy. Does that make sense? It's absolutely true. I have a degree in genetics :-) Related Articles & Discussions Thoughts Pregnant Moms Have After Finding Out the Sex of Their Baby  Finding out whether you're having a boy or a girl is one of the most magical moments during pregnancy.
