Multiple births Facts and a timeline on some of the more publicized multiple births in Canada and around the world. CBC News · Posted: Jan 27, 2009 3:52 PM ET | Last Updated: January 30, 2009 The birth of octuplets in California in January 2009 was only the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said. The mother gave birth to six boys and two girls weighing between one pound, eight ounces and three pounds, four ounces, said doctors at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center near Los Angeles. The hospital had scheduled a caesarean section for seven babies, but doctors said they were surprised when an eighth came out. In January 2008, the birth of sextuplets at a Vancouver hospital marked the first time a set of six babies has been delivered in Canada. Once an extremely rare phenomenon, fertility treatments have made multiple births slightly more common today. But conceiving sextuplets without the use of fertility treatments is extremely rare. In fact, the odds of giving birth to sextuplets spontaneously are one in 4.7 billion. The grandmother of the octuplets in Los Angeles told reporters that her daughter had fertility treatments in order to conceive. It's not known whether fertility treatments were involved in the Vancouver births. The birth of sextuplets has only been recorded approximately 160 times worldwide and few sets survived in full. Currently, the U.S. is home to six sets of sextuplets, all of which are surviving. Twins are the most common form of multiple birth and can occur naturally once in every 90 births. The odds increase for triplets and other multiple births, according to Multiple Births Canada. Spontaneously these births occur in Canada: Once in 8,100 births for triplets. Once in 729,000 births for quadruplets. Once in 65,610,000 births for quintuplets. In recent years, the incidence of multiple births in Canada is on the rise due to the increased use of fertility drugs. It is estimated that 60 per cent of triplets, 90 per cent of quadruplets and 99 per cent of quintuplets are the result of these treatments. Below is a timeline of some of the more publicized multiple births in Canada and across the world. Jan. 26, 2009: Octuplets born in California were the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said. Jan. 7, 2007 A woman gives birth to sextuplets in Vancouver resulting in Canada's first set of sextuplets. The babies were born at just 25 weeks into the mother's pregnancy. Two later died. July 28, 1999 In Saskatoon, the Gilmour family welcomed Canada's eighth set of quintuplets with the assistance of infertility treatments. Originally, six babies were conceived, but one died in the womb, leaving only five. Dec. 8-20, 1998 Octuplets were born to Nkem and Ike Chukwu in Houston, Texas, over a span of 12 days. The eldest baby was born on Dec. 8, but doctors stopped the delivery to give the remaining seven more time in the womb. The rest of the set was born on Dec. 20. A week later, the smallest of the babies died. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the first set of octuplets was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1971, although none of the babies survived. Jan. 14, 1998 The Humair septuplets made headlines when they were born in Abha, Saudi Arabia, not only because they were the second set of septuplets ever recorded, but also because they were born to a 40-year-old mother. Nov. 19, 1997 Born nine weeks premature, the McCaughey septuplets became the world's first set of seven to survive. Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey became the proud parents of the septuplets by way of fertility drugs. May 25, 1993 Holding the title of the first sextuplets born in the U.S., the Dilley sextuplets were delivered in Indiana. The four boys and two girls were conceived using an infertility treatment called Pergonal. Nov. 11, 1983 The United Kingdom received its first set of sextuplets when the Walton babies were born in Liverpool. Jan. 11, 1974 The first known sextuplets were born in Cape Town, South Africa, to Susan and Colin Rosenkowitz. May 28, 1934 Canada's most famous multiple birth, the Dionne quintuplets, were delivered in a northern Ontario farmhouse. The set would become known internationally during the Great Depression and become a tourist attraction. The quints were the world's first set to survive through infancy and were born naturally before the advent of fertility treatments. Jan. 4, 1915 The Keys quadruplets were born in Oklahoma and would grow to become the first all-female set to survive infancy and carry on into adulthood.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

An individual that is part of such a set is called a quintuplet and sometimes referred to as a quint . Types of Quintuplets Quintuplets can be fraternal ( multi zygotic ), identical ( monozygotic ) or a combination of both. Multi zygotic quintuplets occur from five unique egg/sperm combinations. Monozygotic multiples are the result of a fertilized egg that splits into two or more embryos.         It is possible for a split to occur more than once, producing ​ monozygotic triplets or even a rare set of monozygotic quintuplets. Fully monozygotic quintuplets are rare, so rare that it is difficult to assess the odds. Quintuplets can be all male, all female, or a combination of both. (Monozygotic quintuplets will always be of the same gender.) Most quintuplets are a combination of boys and girls; all male or all female quintuples are rare. The first set of all-female quintuplets were born in the United States in 2015. In 2008, a Polish woman gave birth to a set of "probably identical" girls without the aid of fertility drugs. Odds of Quintuplets In 2005, the National Vital Statistics report for the United States reported the birth of 68 quintuplets and higher order multiples. Because this number includes the possible birth of sextuplets, septuplets or more, it is not determined exactly how many of those births were quintuplets.   The spontaneous conception of quintuplets is rare, the average estimate is 1 in about 60 million births. Most recent quintuplet births are the result of assisted reproductive techniques such as fertility enhancing drugs or in-vitro fertilization. Quintuplets do not always share the same birthdate. A delayed interval delivery (also known as iatrogenic asynchronous birth) may mean that individual babies are born days or even weeks apart.         Pregnancy With Quintuplets The average gestation for a quintuplet pregnancy is 29 weeks, as opposed to 40 weeks for a full-term baby. The longest gestation I've discovered was 35 weeks, a record held by the mother of the Stanford quintuplets in Rhode Island. Many mothers will gain more than fifty pounds during their pregnancy and will require cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is sewn shut to prevent preterm labor. Nearly all quintuplet pregnancies result in a cesarean delivery. The average birth weight of a quintuplet is about 2 pounds, 12 ounces and most quintuplets receive medical care in a hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) until they reach their original birth date. Dionne Quintuplets Perhaps the most famous quintuplets are the Dionne Quintuplets born in Canada in 1934. They were the first surviving set of all identical quintuplets. The girls - Annette, Émilie, Yvonne, Cécile, and Marie - attracted worldwide attention. They were removed from their parent's care and placed in the custody of a doctor, who displayed them as a tourist attraction. Interesting Facts About Quintuplets The Wilkinson quintuplets weighed more than 21 pounds combined when they were born at about 34 weeks in 2007. The heaviest quintuplet births on record, according to the Guinness Book of World Records was 25 pounds combined, attributed to two mothers, Liu Saulian (China, 1953) and Mrs. Kamalammal (India, 1956).         Parents of quintuplets will change more than 35,000 diapers before their kids are potty trained. The first set of quintuplets born in the United States were reported to be the Kanouse quints in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1875. They were all boys and did not survive. The Fischer quintuplets were the first surviving quintuplets in the United States, born in 1963 in South Dakota, according to Wikipedia. Baseball player Melvin Mora is a dad of quintuplets born in 2001 (3 girls and 2 boys). The mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics are quintuplets. A 2004 television show, "Quintuplets" starred Andy Richter and Rebecca Creskoff as parents of teenage quints.  The 1994 novel, Feather Crowns , is about a young Kentucky farm couple who gives birth to quintuplets. Support Groups for Families Are you having quintuplets? It's important for families to seek support and advice from other families in the same situation. Here are some organizations that can offer resources and assistance: MOST (Mothers of Supertwins) (United States) Multiple Births Canada's Higher Order Multiples Support Network Australian Multiple Birth Association (AMBA) New Zealand Multiple Birth Association (NZMBA) Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba) (United Kingdom) Strollers for Quintuplets Five-seat quintuplet strollers are available and are a convenient -- though pricey -- option for transporting quints. The most prevalent brand is Runabout , a company that crafts multi-seat tandem strollers with hand-welded steel frames. They are quite expensive, costing nearly $1000 new from the manufacturer, but are widely available on the secondary market. Many families find it convenient to use a combination of double and triple strollers to accommodate all five babies.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Multiple births Facts and a timeline on some of the more publicized multiple births in Canada and around the world. CBC News · Posted: Jan 27, 2009 3:52 PM ET | Last Updated: January 30, 2009 The birth of octuplets in California in January 2009 was only the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said. The mother gave birth to six boys and two girls weighing between one pound, eight ounces and three pounds, four ounces, said doctors at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center near Los Angeles. The hospital had scheduled a caesarean section for seven babies, but doctors said they were surprised when an eighth came out. In January 2008, the birth of sextuplets at a Vancouver hospital marked the first time a set of six babies has been delivered in Canada. Once an extremely rare phenomenon, fertility treatments have made multiple births slightly more common today. But conceiving sextuplets without the use of fertility treatments is extremely rare. In fact, the odds of giving birth to sextuplets spontaneously are one in 4.7 billion. The grandmother of the octuplets in Los Angeles told reporters that her daughter had fertility treatments in order to conceive. It's not known whether fertility treatments were involved in the Vancouver births. The birth of sextuplets has only been recorded approximately 160 times worldwide and few sets survived in full. Currently, the U.S. is home to six sets of sextuplets, all of which are surviving. Twins are the most common form of multiple birth and can occur naturally once in every 90 births. The odds increase for triplets and other multiple births, according to Multiple Births Canada. Spontaneously these births occur in Canada: Once in 8,100 births for triplets. Once in 729,000 births for quadruplets. Once in 65,610,000 births for quintuplets. In recent years, the incidence of multiple births in Canada is on the rise due to the increased use of fertility drugs. It is estimated that 60 per cent of triplets, 90 per cent of quadruplets and 99 per cent of quintuplets are the result of these treatments. Below is a timeline of some of the more publicized multiple births in Canada and across the world. Jan. 26, 2009: Octuplets born in California were the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said. Jan. 7, 2007 A woman gives birth to sextuplets in Vancouver resulting in Canada's first set of sextuplets. The babies were born at just 25 weeks into the mother's pregnancy. Two later died. July 28, 1999 In Saskatoon, the Gilmour family welcomed Canada's eighth set of quintuplets with the assistance of infertility treatments. Originally, six babies were conceived, but one died in the womb, leaving only five. Dec. 8-20, 1998 Octuplets were born to Nkem and Ike Chukwu in Houston, Texas, over a span of 12 days. The eldest baby was born on Dec. 8, but doctors stopped the delivery to give the remaining seven more time in the womb. The rest of the set was born on Dec. 20. A week later, the smallest of the babies died. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the first set of octuplets was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1971, although none of the babies survived. Jan. 14, 1998 The Humair septuplets made headlines when they were born in Abha, Saudi Arabia, not only because they were the second set of septuplets ever recorded, but also because they were born to a 40-year-old mother. Nov. 19, 1997 Born nine weeks premature, the McCaughey septuplets became the world's first set of seven to survive. Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey became the proud parents of the septuplets by way of fertility drugs. May 25, 1993 Holding the title of the first sextuplets born in the U.S., the Dilley sextuplets were delivered in Indiana. The four boys and two girls were conceived using an infertility treatment called Pergonal. Nov. 11, 1983 The United Kingdom received its first set of sextuplets when the Walton babies were born in Liverpool. Jan. 11, 1974 The first known sextuplets were born in Cape Town, South Africa, to Susan and Colin Rosenkowitz. May 28, 1934 Canada's most famous multiple birth, the Dionne quintuplets, were delivered in a northern Ontario farmhouse. The set would become known internationally during the Great Depression and become a tourist attraction. The quints were the world's first set to survive through infancy and were born naturally before the advent of fertility treatments. Jan. 4, 1915 The Keys quadruplets were born in Oklahoma and would grow to become the first all-female set to survive infancy and carry on into adulthood.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Credit:  Allen Jones, University Marketing, VCU Medical Center     A woman in Virginia recently gave birth to sextuplets, after she and her husband had tried to conceive for nearly two decades. But how does such a high-order pregnancy happen?  The six babies — three boys and three girls — were born on May 11 at VCU Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia. The babies ranged in size from 1 lb., 10 ounces (0.74 kilograms) to 2 lbs., 15 ounces (1.33 kg) and required a 40-person team to coordinate the delivery. Prior to this pregnancy, the mother, Ajibola Taiwo, and father, Adeboye Taiwo, had tried unsuccessfully to become pregnant for 17 years, according to VCU Medical Center.  "It's not every day that parents bring home sextuplets," Dr. Ronald Ramus, director of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at VCU Medical Center, said in a statement . "Mrs. Taiwo was eating, sleeping and breathing for seven."       Adeboye and Ajibola Taiwo are the parents of sextuplets.  Credit: Allen Jones, University Marketing, VCU Medical Center    A multiple pregnancy, in which a woman is pregnant with two or more fetuses at the same time, happens either when a fertilized egg splits before it implants in the uterus (as is the case with identical twins) or when separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm (making fraternal twins), according to the Cleveland Clinic. [ 7 Baby Myths Debunked ]  But pregnancies involving three or more fetuses are rare. Nearly 4 million live births occurred in the United States in 2015, and 3,871 of these were triplets, while 228 were quadruplets and just 24 were quintuplets or other higher-order births (like sextuplets), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It's very rare for such high-order pregnancies to happen naturally, without the help of fertility treatments .  "The chance for high-multiple gestations — four and above — to happen spontaneously, is extremely, extremely rare," said Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of Northwell Health Fertility in Manhasset, New York, who is not involved in the sextuplets' care.  Fertility drugs increase the chances of a multiple pregnancy because these medicines stimulate the ovaries to produce many eggs. If some of these many eggs are fertilized at the same time, they can result in multiple babies, according to the University of Rochester.   In vitro fertilization (IVF) can also result in a multiple pregnancy, but this is less common today than in the past. That's because, in the past, the chances of becoming pregnant with IVF were quite low, so doctors would transfer multiple embryos to the uterus to increase the chances of pregnancy, Hershlag said.  "In the early days of IVF, [it] was still responsible for a high percentage of multiples, because it was not uncommon to put [in] three, four, five or even six embryos at a time," Hershlag said. But as researchers optimized IVF techniques, they increased the likelihood that each embryo transferred would result in a pregnancy.  "Our field has now moved to strictly limit the number of embryos transferred," Hershlag told Live Science. In general, almost all younger women treated at reputable fertility centers will have a single embryo transferred, he said.  The reduction in embryos transferred during IVF has contributed to a decline in triplets and other higher-order births in the United States; from 1998 to 2015, the rate of triplets and other higher-order births in the U.S. dropped 46 percent, according to the CDC. And a 2013 study found that fertility drugs alone are responsible for a greater proportion of high-order births (triplets or more), compared with IVF.  Hershlag stressed that multiple pregnancies are associated with a higher risk of complications than single pregnancies, including an increased risk of preterm birth.  "High-multiple births is not a boon to any fertility center. This is not an achievement," Hershlag said. "While I'm wishing health and good outcomes ultimately to the couple that just gave birth to the sextuplets, I need to emphasize that such an occurrence should be long in the past. Fertility physicians should make a huge effort to transfer single embryos as much as possible."  All six babies are being treated in the neonatal intensive care unit and are doing well, VCU said. Ajibola Taiwo was released from the hospital on May 18, and she and her husband are actively participating in their babies' care, the statement said.   Original article on Live Science .

Multiples in pregnancy Twins triplets quads identical and fraternal            Home : Ovulation Planner : Duedate : Baby Names : Week by Week : Site Map :             Types of Multiples in pregnancy   A pregnancy of two or more fetuses is called a multiple pregnancy. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

This is a list of multiple births , consisting of notable higher order (4+) multiple births and pregnancies. Twins and triplets are sufficiently common to have their own separate articles. With the use of reproductive technology such as fertility drugs and in vitro fertilization (IVF) such births have become increasingly common. This list contains only multiple births which have some claim to notability, such as being the first recorded in a country, the first to survive to adulthood in a country, or the heaviest, lightest or longest lived (globally).

The series ended in 2011, with the last episode airing on September 12 of that year, then resumed with a new season in January 2015.  The Hayes sextuplets (born September 14, 2004, in Long Branch, New Jersey ) are the first surviving sextuplets to be born in New Jersey .

The babies were later returned to the parents. [86] [87]  The Carpio sextuplets (born October 6, 2008, in the New York City borough of Queens ) are the first Hispanic sextuplets to be born in America. It is not known if their parents, Victor and Digna Carpio, conceived using fertility treatments. The babies (Justin, Jadon, Jezreel, Danelia, Genesis, and Joel) were delivered by Caesarean section at 25 weeks.

The identical sisters were born just outside Callander, Ontario , near the village of Corbeil . All five survived to adulthood.  The Dionne girls were born two months premature . After four months with their family, they were made wards of the state for the next nine years under the Dionne Quintuplets' Guardianship Act, 1935 . [1] The Ontario provincial government and those around them began to profit by making them a significant tourist attraction.  The identical quintuplet sisters were, in order of birth:   Yvonne Édouilda Marie Dionne (died 2001)  Annette Lillianne Marie Allard (living)  Cécile Marie Émilda Langlois (living)  Émilie Marie Jeanne Dionne (died 1954)  Marie Reine Alma Houle (died 1970)      Contents    1  Biography   1.1  Family  1.2  Birth  1.3  Taken from parents  1.4  At the Dafoe Nursery  1.5  Film career  1.6  Return to family  1.7  Adult years  1.8  Dionne Quints Museum    2  In popular culture  3  References  4  Bibliography  5  External links   5.1  Media       Biography [ edit ]  Family [ edit ]  The Dionne family was headed by father Oliva-Edouard (1904–1979) and mother Elzire (Legros) Dionne (1909–1986), who married on September 15, 1925. They lived just outside Corbeil , in a farmhouse in unregistered territory. Oliva, through his father, was a descendant of Zacharie Cloutier [2] (via Louise Cloutier 1632–1699, Charlotte Mignault 1669–1747, and Antoine Dionne 1641-1721). The Dionnes were a French-speaking farming family with five older children, Ernest (1926–1995), Rose Marie (1928–1995), Thérèse (b. 1929), Daniel (1932–1995), and Pauline (b. 1933), who was only eleven months older than the quintuplets. A sixth child, Léo (b. 1930), died of pneumonia shortly after birth.  The Dionnes also had three sons after the quintuplets: Oliva Jr. (1936–2017), Victor (1938–2007), and Claude (1946–2009).  Birth [ edit ]  Elzire suspected she was carrying twins, but no one was aware that quintuplets were even possible. The quintuplets were born two months premature. In 1938, the doctors had a theory that was later proven correct when genetic tests showed that the girls were identical , meaning they were created from a single egg cell. Elzire reported having had cramps in her third month and passing a strange object which may have been a sixth fetus. [3]  Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe is credited with ensuring the successful live birth of the quintuplets. Originally, he diagnosed Elzire with a "fetal abnormality". He delivered the babies with the help of two midwives, Aunt Donalda and Madame Benoit Lebel, who were summoned by Oliva Dionne in the middle of the night. [3]  Émilie and Marie shared an embryonic sac, Annette and Yvonne shared an embryonic sac, and it is believed that Cécile shared an embryonic sac with the miscarried sixth baby. [4] All but Émilie were later discovered to be right-handed [5] and all but Marie had a counter-clockwise whorl in their hair. [6] [7]  The quintuplets' total weight at birth was 13 pounds, 6 ounces. Their individual weights and measurements were not recorded. The quintuplets were immediately wrapped in cotton sheets and old napkins, and laid in the corner of the bed. Elzire went into shock, but she recovered in two hours. [3] [7]  The babies were kept in a wicker basket borrowed from the neighbours, covered with heated blankets. They were brought into the kitchen and set by the open door of the stove to keep warm. One by one, they were taken out of the basket and massaged with olive oil. Every two hours for the first twenty-four, they were fed water sweetened with corn syrup. By the second day they were moved to a slightly larger laundry basket and kept warm with hot-water bottles. They were watched constantly and often had to be roused. They were then fed with "seven-twenty" formula: cow's milk, boiled water, two spoonfuls of corn syrup, and one or two drops of rum for a stimulant. [8]  News of the unusual birth spread quickly, sparked by Oliva's brother's inquiry to the local newspaper editor about how much he would charge for an announcement of five babies at a single birth. Before long, people from all over North America were offering assistance. Individuals sent supplies and well-meant advice (a famous letter from Appalachia recommends tiny doses of burnt rye whiskey to prevent diarrhoea ); [9] one hospital sent two incubators.  Taken from parents [ edit ]     En route to Toronto for presentation to Queen Elizabeth in 1939    Oliva, already poor with five children, was approached by fair exhibitors for Chicago 's Century of Progress exhibition within days of the girls' birth, seeking to put the quintuplets on display and show them to the world. (At the time it was not unusual for so-called "incubator babies" to be displayed at fairs and other exhibitions. [10] ) The parents were persuaded to agree, and although the contract was revoked before it was ever put into effect, it raised the issue of exploitation of the children. [11]  Four months after the birth of the sisters, the Ontario government intervened and found the parents to be unfit for the quintuplets (although not for their previous children). Custody of the five babies was withdrawn from their parents by the Lieutenant Governor - in-Council , on the advice of Premier  Mitchell Hepburn , in 1935. The guardianship was initially for two years. Although Oliva Dionne remained part of the guardianship, the children were put under the guidance of Dr. Dafoe and two others. The stated reason for removing the quintuplets from their parents' legal custody was to ensure their survival.  The government realised there was massive public interest in the sisters and proceeded to engender a tourist industry around them. [12] The girls were made wards of the provincial Crown , planned until they reached the age of 18. [ citation needed ]  At the Dafoe Nursery [ edit ]  Across the road from their birthplace, the Dafoe Hospital and Nursery was built for the five girls and their new caregivers. The girls were moved from the farmhouse to this nursery at the end of September and lived there until they were nine years old. [12] The compound had an outdoor playground designed to be a public observation area. It was surrounded by a covered arcade, which allowed tourists to observe the sisters behind one-way screens. The facility was funded by a Red Cross fundraiser. It was a nine-room nursery with a staff house nearby. The staff house held the three nurses and the three policemen in charge of guarding them, while a housekeeper and two maids lived in the main building with the quintuplets. The buildings were surrounded by a seven-foot barbed-wire fence. The sisters were brought to the playground for thirty minutes two or three times a day. [ citation needed ]  The Dionne sisters were constantly tested, studied, and examined, with records being taken of everything. While living at the compound, they had a somewhat rigid lifestyle. They were not required to participate in chores and were privately tutored in the same building where they lived. Cared for primarily by nurses, they had limited exposure to the world outside the boundaries of the compound except for the daily rounds of tourists, who, from the sisters' point of view, were generally heard but not seen. [12] They also had occasional contact with their parents and siblings across the road. Every morning they dressed together in a big bathroom, had doses of orange juice and cod-liver oil, and then went to have their hair curled. They then said a prayer, a gong was sounded, and they ate breakfast in the dining room. After thirty minutes, they had to clear the table. They then went and played in the sunroom for thirty minutes, took a fifteen-minute break, and at nine o'clock had their morning inspection with Dr. Dafoe. Every month they had a different timetable of activities. They bathed every day before dinner and put on their pajamas. Dinner was served at precisely six o'clock. They then went into the quiet playroom to say their evening prayers. Each girl had a colour and a symbol to mark whatever belonged to her. Annette's colour was red and her design a maple leaf, Cecile's green and a turkey. Emilie had white and a tulip, Marie blue and a teddy bear, and Yvonne pink and a bluebird. [13]  Approximately 6,000 people per day visited the observation gallery that surrounded the outdoor playground to view the Dionne sisters. Ample parking was provided and almost 3,000,000 people walked through the gallery between 1936 and 1943. Oliva Dionne ran a souvenir shop and a concession store opposite the nursery and the area acquired the name "Quintland". The souvenirs, picturing the five sisters, included autographs and framed photographs, spoons, cups, plates, plaques, candy bars, books, postcards and dolls. Oliva also sold stones from the Dionne farm that were supposed to have a magical power of fertility. Midwives Madame LeGros and Madame LeBelle also opened their own souvenir and dining stand. [14] The quintuplets brought in more than $50 million in total tourist revenue to Ontario. [15] Quintland became Ontario's biggest tourist attraction of the era, surpassing the Canadian side of Niagara Falls . [ citation needed ] It was only rivaled by Radio City Music Hall , Mount Vernon , and Gettysburg in the United States. Hollywood stars who came to Callander to visit the Quints included Clark Gable , James Stewart , Bette Davis , James Cagney , and Mae West . Amelia Earhart also visited Callander just six weeks before her ill-fated flight in 1937. [ citation needed ]  The sisters, their likenesses and images, along with Dr. Dafoe, were used to publicize commercial products including Karo  corn syrup and Quaker Oats . They increased the sales of condensed milk, toothpaste, disinfectant, and many other products through their promotions. [ citation needed ]  Film career [ edit ]  The Dionne girls starred in three Hollywood feature films, which were essentially fictionalised versions of their story. They played the 'Wyatt Quintuplets' in all three films:   The Country Doctor (1936) – directed by Henry King and starring Jean Hersholt  Five of a Kind (1938) - The sequel to the above film.  Reunion (1936) [16]   In the first two films, the Dionne quintuplets didn't so much act as simply appear. Their scenes were filmed at Quintland in Callendar, and largely consisted of them playing and interacting with each other, as one would expect of normal 2- and 4-year-old children. Both films concentrated more on telling the (fictionalized) story of the heroic doctor who delivered the Wyatts and took care of them, than it did on the Wyatt quintuplets themselves. [ citation needed ]  The Dionne quintuplets also appeared in numerous newsreels and a short documentary film called Five Times Five in 1939. This film was nominated for an Oscar in 1940. [ citation needed ] In 1942, they appeared in one of James A. Fitzpatrick's Traveltalks  Land of the Quintuplets shortly before they were returned to their parents. In 1998, the three surviving sisters, Cécile, Annette and Yvonne, participated in an hour-long documentary, "Full Circle: The Untold Story of the Dionne Quintuplets", written and directed by Maya Gallus , and broadcast on the CBC documentary series Life & Times . [ citation needed ]  Return to family [ edit ]     The quintuplets in 1947 with their parents and a priest in the background    In November 1943, the Dionne parents won back custody of the sisters. The entire family moved into a newly built house within walking distance of Quintland. The yellow brick, 20-room mansion was paid for out of the quintuplets' fund. The home had many amenities that were considered luxuries at the time, including telephones, electricity and hot water and was nicknamed "The Big House". The building is now a retirement home. [17]  The nursery was eventually converted into an accredited school house where the sisters finished their secondary education along with ten girls from the area who were chosen to attend. In later years, it was used by the Recluses of Corbeil as a convent. [ citation needed ]  While the parents claimed that they wished to integrate the quintuplets into the family, the sisters frequently travelled to perform at various functions, still dressed identically. According to the accounts of the surviving sisters, the parents often treated them at home as a five-part unit, and frequently lectured them about the trouble they had caused the family by existing. They were sometimes denied privileges the other children received, and were more strictly disciplined and punished. They also received a heavier share of the housework and farmwork. [ citation needed ] They were unaware for many years that the lavish house, the expensive food and the series of cars the family enjoyed were paid for with money they themselves had earned. [ citation needed ]  In particular, Oliva Dionne was resentful and suspicious of outsiders as a result of his having lost custody of the girls. In 1995, the three surviving sisters alleged that their father had sexually abused them during their teenaged years. [18]  Adult years [ edit ]  The quintuplets left the family home upon turning 18 years old in 1952 and had little contact with their parents afterwards. Three went on to marry and have children: Marie had two daughters, Annette three sons, and Cécile five children, including one who died in infancy and twins Bruno and Bertrand. [19] Émilie devoted her brief life to becoming a nun . Yvonne finished nursing school before turning to sculpting, then later becoming a librarian. [20] Émilie died at the age of 20 as a result of a seizure. She had a series of seizures while she was a postulant at a convent and had asked not to be left unattended, but the nun who was supposed to be watching her thought she was asleep and went to Mass . Émilie had another seizure, rolled onto her belly and, unable to raise her face from her pillow, accidentally suffocated. [21] In 1970, Marie was living alone in an apartment and her sisters were worried after not hearing from her in several days. Her doctor went to her home and found her in bed, Marie having been dead for days. Her estranged husband quickly reported to the media that there had been a blood clot in her brain. [ citation needed ]  Annette and Cécile both eventually divorced and by the 1990s, the three surviving sisters lived together in the Montreal suburb of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville . [ citation needed ]  In 1965, author James Brough wrote a book, in cooperation with the then four surviving sisters, called We Were Five . Pierre Berton published a biography called The Dionne Years: A Thirties Melodrama in 1977 and narrated a 1978 National Film Board of Canada documentary. [ citation needed ] John Nihmey and Stuart Foxman published the fictional Time of Their Lives — The Dionne Tragedy in 1986. Nihmey and Foxman's book was the basis for the 1994 TV miniseries Million Dollar Babies (1994), produced by CBC Television and CBS Television and starring Beau Bridges , Roy Dupuis and Céline Bonnier . [ citation needed ]  In 1997, the three surviving sisters wrote an open letter to the parents of the McCaughey septuplets , warning against allowing too much publicity for the children. The letter read: [22] [23]   Dear Bobbi and Kenny,  If we emerge momentarily from the privacy we have sought all our adult lives, it is only to send a message to the McCaughey family. We three would like you to know we feel a natural affinity and tenderness for your children. We hope your children receive more respect than we did. Their fate should be no different from that of other children. Multiple births should not be confused with entertainment, nor should they be an opportunity to sell products.  Our lives have been ruined by the exploitation we suffered at the hands of the government of Ontario, our place of birth. We were displayed as a curiosity three times a day for millions of tourists. To this day we receive letters from all over the world. To all those who have expressed their support in light of the abuse we have endured, we say thank you. And to those who would seek to exploit the growing fame of these children, we say beware.  We sincerely hope a lesson will be learned from examining how our lives were forever altered by our childhood experience. If this letter changes the course of events for these newborns, then perhaps our lives will have served a higher purpose.  Sincerely, Annette, Cécile and Yvonne Dionne   In 1998, the sisters reached a $2.8 million settlement with the Ontario government as compensation for their exploitation. [24] [25]  As of December 2017 there are two surviving sisters, Annette and Cécile. Yvonne died in 2001. [26]  Dionne Quints Museum [ edit ]  A sibling of the quintuplets was the first to open the Dionne home as a museum. [ citation needed ] The original family homestead was moved around 1960 to a location on Highway 11B (near the present Clarion Resort ), and again in 1985 to North Bay and converted into the non-profit Dionne Quintuplets Museum. The museum is located at the intersection of Highway 11 and the Trans Canada Highway and features many artifacts from the quints' early days and their growing years. As of October, 2016, the museum is now closed, and the city of North Bay is considering selling the building as surplus, though a petition is being circulated by citizens to have it designated and preserved as a historical structure. In 2017, plans surfaced for the city to sell the building, and relocate it to a fairground in the village of Sundridge 75 km south of North Bay. [12] On November 9, 2017 the City of North Bay announced plans to move the house on November 19 to a new site in downtown North Bay (on Oak Street in a vacant area between Marina Point Retirement Residence and Discovery North Bay Museum , a former CPR Station c. 1903) and will re-open in May 2018. [27]  In popular culture [ edit ]      Dionne Quintuplets – School Days , painting by Andrew Loomis, 1938    Canadian mystery writer Louise Penny said the fictional Ouellet quintuplets in her book How The Light Gets In "were certainly inspired by the Dionne girls". [28]  Stephen Sondheim referenced the quintuplets in his song " I'm Still Here " from the musical Follies with the line "I got through Abie's Irish Rose , five Dionne babies, Major Bowes ...". [29]  The fourth episode of the Amazon television series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is called "The Disappointment of the Dionne Quintuplets". Three of the Dionne Quintuplets were referenced by Curly Howard in a 'Three Stooges' episode entitled 'False Alarms', aired August 15, 1936.  In 2018, the birth of the quints was named a National Historic Event . [30]  References [ edit ]    ^  Lillian Barker (1951). The Dionne Legend: Quintuplets in Captivity .

(July 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The Genain quadruplets (born in 1930) are a set of identical quadruplet sisters. All four developed schizophrenia , suggesting a large genetic component to the cause of the disease. [1] The pseudonym Genain , used to protect the identity of the family, comes from the Greek , meaning dire (αἶνος) birth (γεν-). [1] The sisters were given the pseudonyms Nora, Iris, Myra and Hester, to represent each of the four letters in NIMH, the acronym for the United States  National Institute of Mental Health . [1] Nora, Iris, and Hester were hospitalized for their schizophrenia at least once each. [1] As of 2011, Iris and Hester have died [2]     Contents    1  Personal lives  2  Illness and scientific research  3  References  4  Further reading     Personal lives [ edit ]  The sisters were born in a midwestern American town (nicknamed “Envira”) on April 14, 1930. [3] They were considered local celebrities due to the quadruple nature of their birth. [3]  The four sisters grew up with their parents in the same household. The Genain sisters' parents were described as "disturbed". [1] Their paternal grandmother may have had paranoid schizophrenia, and their father was described as abusive. Myra and Nora were probably treated more favorably by their parents, while Iris and Hester were treated more harshly. [3] The parents considered Hester to be a “habitual masturbator” [1] and referred to her as a “moron type” or “sex maniac”. [3] Iris and Hester were both circumcised as children in order to prevent them from masturbation. [4] [3] The quadruplets were reportedly physically abused by their father, pseudonymed as Mr. Genain .  Subsequently, the Genains accepted an offer by the NIMH to take the daughters into their clinic and each was diagnosed with schizophrenia.  All of the sisters except Hester graduated from high school. [3]  Myra worked as a secretary for most of her life. She married and had two sons. [3] When she grew older, she frequently visited her sisters Nora and Hester. Her eldest son contracted HIV after a blood transfusion and died in 1996, while her younger son became a maintenance worker and retained a close relationship with his mother. [3] Nora later managed the income the sisters received for having their photograph published in textbooks. [3] Iris worked as a beautician for a while but most of her adult life was spent institutionalized. [5]  Illness and scientific research [ edit ]  All four of the sisters developed schizophrenia by the age of 24. [3]  There was a history of mental illness in Mr. Genain's family that might have been an example of genetics being linked with mental illness or it may have just been a dysfunctional and abusive family free from a specific genetic component.  Mr. Genain's mother had had a three-year nervous breakdown in her late teens. The NIMH had recorded behaviors in Mr. Genain's siblings indicative of mental illness.

[1] [2] The children are Hannah, Lucy, Ruth, Sarah, Kate and Jennifer.  The children were born to Graham and Janet (née Timperley) Walton (born 1952) who had been trying to have children for several years and had just been accepted as potential adoptive parents before their thirteenth attempt at fertility treatment bore spectacular results. [3] The children grew up in the family's seven-bedroom home in Wallasey , Merseyside . On 13 June 2011 the sextuplets were featured in the ITV1 programme Moving On .

Photo reprinted with permission of Jon Gosselin.       More in Ages and Stages        Multiples       Through the Years     Babies     Toddlers     Preschoolers     School-Age Kids     Tweens     Teens        Sextuplets are a set of six offspring born at one birth. An individual that is part of such a set is called a sextuplet . Types Sextuplets can be fraternal (multizygotic), identical (monozygotic) or a combination of both. Multizygotic sextuplets occur from six unique egg/sperm combinations. Monozygotic multiples are the result of a fertilized egg that splits into two or more embryos.         It is possible for the split to occur more than once, producing monozygotic triplets or potentially even a set of monozygotic sextuplets, although none have been documented. It is also possible for sextuplets to include one or more sets of monozygotic twins among the six individuals. Sextuplets can be all male, all female, or a combination of both. Monozygotic multiples will always be of the same gender. Statistics Facts About Multiples records 179 sets of sextuplets in the world as of November 2007. The first surviving set of sextuplets was born in South Africa in 1974. The first surviving set of sextuplets from the United States were the Dilley sextuplets born in 1993, often referred to as the "Dilley Six Pack". Very few incidences of spontaneous conception of sextuplets have been reported; nearly all of the sextuplet births in the last 30 years were the result of fertility enhancements such as ovulation-stimulating drugs.   Sextuplets do not necessarily have to share the same birthdate. A delayed interval delivery (also known as iatrogenic asynchronous birth) may mean that individual babies are born days or even weeks apart, such as the Van Houten babies born in 2004. Pregnancy The average gestation for a sextuplet pregnancy is 29.1 weeks, as opposed to 40 weeks for a full-term baby.         During a pregnancy with sextuplets, a mother will gain 40-100 pounds. According to Mothers of Super Twins (MOST), the average weight gain is 55 pounds. Many mothers will require cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is sewn shut to prevent preterm labor . Nearly all sextuplet pregnancies result in a caesarean delivery; only 3 cases of natural delivery of sextuplets are cited at Facts About Multiples. The average birthweight of a sextuplet is about 2 1/2 pounds, and nearly all sextuplets require medical care in a hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) for several weeks to months after birth. Interesting Facts Sextuplets have been widely followed in the media, from the Dilley "Six Pack" born in 1993 to the television series "Jon & Kate Plus 8" which documents the daily life of the Gosselin family who have both twins and sextuplets. Six sets of sextuplets were born in the United States in 2004. The Walton sextuplets of Great Britain were the first surviving set of all-female sextuplets; there are no known surviving sets of all male sextuplets. There were two sextuplet births on June 10, 2007: the Masches in Arizona and the Morrisons in Minnesota (only one of the Morrison babies survived.)         Many parents of sextuplets are urged to consider selective reduction, reducing the number of viable fetuses to two in order to protect the health of the mother and give the babies the best chance of survival. Many parents of sextuplets have deep religious convictions that preclude them from seeking a reduction, and their faith sustains them through their extreme pregnancy. Support Groups Are you having sextuplets? It's important for families to seek support and advice from other families in the same situation. Here are some organizations that can offer resources and assistance: MOST (Mothers of Supertwins : http://www.mostonline.org/index.htm (United States) Multiple Births Canada's Higher Order Multiples Support Network:  http://multiplebirthscanada.org/index.php/parents/support/higher-order-multiples-support-network (Canada) The Triplet Connection : http://www.tripletconnection.org/ (United States) National Organization of Mothers of Twins Clubs (NOMOTC):  http://www.multiplesofamerica.org/ (United States) Australian Multiple Birth Association (AMBA):  http://www.amba.org.au/ (Australia) New Zealand Mutiple Birth Association (NZMBA):  http://www.nzmba.info/ (New Zealand) Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba):  https://www.tamba.org.uk/big-research-appeal?tab=1 (United Kingdom)  Strollers Six-seat strollers are available and are a convenient -- though pricey -- option for transporting six babies. Runabout crafts multi-seat strollers with hand-welded steel frames and manufactures a model with six seats. They are quite expensive, costing nearly $1500 new from the manufacturer, but may be available on the secondary market. (Triplet Connection also offers discounts for parents of multiples.)

naturally conceived sextuplets, were delivered by ­caesarean section
within five minutes of each other.  The four
girls and two boys were 14 weeks premature and weigh between 1lb 7oz
and 2lb 2oz. Last night they were being monitored in an intensive care
unit.  Neonatal consultant Clifford Mayes, who
led the 30-strong delivery team at the Royal ­Hospital in Belfast,
said: “This is both a happy time and a potentially difficult time.  “It
is an extraordinary thing to have witnessed but you are also struck by
the fact that there are little babies in intensive care.”  Lead
midwife Patricia Denvir said: “It was a very stressful situation for
staff and for the parents, but it went very well. Both parents were
composed.”  Britain’s last sextuplets were girls born in 1983 to Janet Walton, who had fertility treatment.    Their
father Graham Walton, 58, said yesterday: “The new parents will have to
be organised. There was so much to do and think about and there was
never enough time.  “But all you can do is keep smiling and enjoy every minute of it.”  Sextuplets occur naturally in one out of 4.5million pregnancies but fertility treatments have led to a rise in multiple births.  However, the babies were conceived naturally without the aid of IVF.  Dr
Mayes said there had been weeks of preparation involving experts from
across the country working to ensure the babies arrived safely.    The
birth “went as well as we had hoped it would,” he said. “The care of
the babies would be the care we would normally expect for any baby.”  Dr
Mayes said it would be impossible for a woman to go full term with six
babies – she might make 30 weeks at best – but the mother had carried
them for 26 weeks. Midwife Mrs Denvir added: “The mother was very
composed. Under a very stressful situation both parents were very
composed and they dealt with it very well.  “It is a very emotional time but it’s also very stressful for all concerned.”  Keith
Reed, chief executive of the Twins and Multiple Births Association,
said the case was unique in the UK and described the babies as
“miracles”.    He said: “This is wonderful news
and everyone in the multiple birth community will be keeping their
fingers crossed that mother and babies thrive.  “Around
half of the 11,000 multiple births each year are premature resulting in
one or more of their babies being cared for in a Neo Natal Intensive
Care Unit so our families understand the roller coaster of emotions
this family will be on.”  The news follows the case of single mother Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to octuplets in California in January.  Britain’s
most famous multiple birth mother is probably Mandy Allwood, who in
1996 miscarried all eight of her babies at 19 weeks.    But in 1983 the Walton sextuplets were born in Liverpool. Hannah, Lucy, Ruth, Sarah, Kate and Jenny are now 25.  Sextuplet
father Mr Walton, 58, added: “My wife is so very organised. We had to
be, changing nappies, feeding, sleeping, at all hours of the day and
night.  “There was always so much to think about and never enough time to do it.  “All
I can say to them is that there will be lots of tears, as with any
family, but there will also be lots of fun and special times ahead.”  on pregnancies but fertility treatments have led to a rise in multiple births.

March 23, 2011 12:16 PM   Subscribe  What are the odds, really, of having identical triplets?   Okay, I'm not really asking for the odds, but I do want to be able to dispute a statistic that is often quoted  in  the media and by other people.  It is often said that the odds of having identical triplets are 1:200 million. Which to me sounds ridiculous, but I'm not sure if my reasoning is sound.  We have identical triplets, born in December of 2007. I know of several other sets, also born in 2007. At least 3 (one set in 4/2007, one in 8/2007, and another set in 12/2007.) These are only ones I've met online. I'm assuming there are more out there.   According to the CDC , there were 4,317,119 births in 2007. (I don't know if they count a multiples birth as one, or if it's one per kid, but I don't think that really matters for the purposes of this question.) Four of those, at least, were ID triplets. That's more like 1:1,000,000, and those are only the sets I know. So it's likely to be even less than that. Right?  I'm just annoyed by reading that 1:200 million  statistic, and would like to be able to refute it intelligently.  (I'm just posting information from 2007 since that's what I have, but I assume the birth rates are the same every year.)  As you can tell from a previous question , I don't really understand probability and statistics all that well. So use layman's terms, if you don't mind.  posted by pyjammy to Science & Nature (24 answers total) 2 users marked this as a favorite           you need to find out, from the CDC or whomever tracks those birth statistics, how many of those births were triplets.  Then, you need to look at data over a span of several decades, not just one year.  Then, you can calculate the correct odds.  What you're suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 10 times, and did not get 5 heads and 5 tails, therefore the 50/50 odds of coinflips is wrong." posted by k5.user at 12:24 PM on March 23, 2011  Here's two data points:   The National Center for Health Statistics says there were 294 sets of triplets born in the United States in 1944 out of a total of 2,794,800 births.  There is no record of how many of the 294 were identical triples. But Dr. Louis G. Keith of the Northwestern University Medical School, who has written extensively on this subject, believes most of those 294 were probably identical.  With fertility treatments affecting birth rates now, in 2002 there were 6,898 sets of triplets out of 4,021,726 births in the U.S. and again, there is no record of how many of these were identical. Fertility treatments do not cause identical triplets to be born as they utilize individual eggs for their zygotes. Identical triplets are mono-zygotic (a single zygote which splits into three). So with more triplets being born and the rate of identical triplets staying the same, identical triplets are more rare now than they were back in 1944.  The odds of conceiving "spontaneous" triplets is about 1 in 8,100. In the early '80s, triplets occurred 1 in every 6,400. Today, odds are that 1 in every 1,300 are triplets. Over the last decade, increases in the number of triplet births averaged 11 percent a year.  The 1 in 200 million quote seems completely fabricated, if "most" triplets born pre-fertility-drugs were identical. However, keep in mind triplets born in 2007 are still fairly young; they might not look as identical as they get older. We'll need DNA tests to be sure. posted by gerryblog at 12:28 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 3 favorites ]  Are they genetically identical or just looks REALLY REALLY similar? Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, for example, are not genetically identical (I read somewhere in the last 2 decades.) posted by k8t at 12:29 PM on March 23, 2011  According to this page identical triplets occur in 1 in 62500 pregnancies.  It looks truthy and facty to me, though who knows. posted by PercussivePaul at 12:35 PM on March 23, 2011  Based on UK statistics (2009, Office of National Statistics, General Registry Office Scotland and GRO Northern Ireland), the rate of any twin is 16 in 1000 births, and the rate of identical twins is 1/3 that, or figure 5 in 1000 births.  I think the formation of an identical triplet would require first the formation of an identical twin, and then one of those twins to form another identical twin. So my estimate would be 5 in one million. posted by babbageboole at 12:37 PM on March 23, 2011  And, of course, I can't multiply. I meant 25 in one million, or 1 in 40,000. That seems a bit high, though. posted by babbageboole at 12:38 PM on March 23, 2011  gerryblog - that's a great article!  k8 - send me your address and I'll send you one.  PercussivePaul, I've always liked that statistic. It seems more realistic to me. That's the one I generally tell people when they ask how rare it is. I think I must have gotten it from that same page.  Babbageboole, I like the way you came up with that. That makes sense to me. posted by pyjammy at 12:47 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 2 favorites ]  If the odds of having identical triplets were one in 200 million, there would be about thirty-five sets of them in the world -- seven billion divided by 200 million. This seems unreasonably low.  babbageboole: there's something called "Hellin's Law" which is a rule of thumb for the incidence of all multiple births, not just identical ones; it states that the frequency of twins is one in 89, of triplets is one in 89 2 , and so on. This agrees with your intuition but I don't know enough about the mechanism to say whether it would apply specifically to identical multiple births. posted by madcaptenor at 12:49 PM on March 23, 2011  Statistics are either true or false. Just because something "makes sense" or "seems more realistic" doesn't mean that it's any more likely to be true. posted by 23skidoo at 12:51 PM on March 23, 2011  23skidoo - really? What about incorrect statistics, like the one my question is about? posted by pyjammy at 12:54 PM on March 23, 2011  It's incorrect if someone shows it to be incorrect. It's not incorrect just because it seems wrong. posted by 23skidoo at 1:06 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 4 favorites ]  I'm seeing statistic similar to babbage's: worldwide, the rate for monozygotic twins is 4 in 1000, which (in theory) calculates out to 16:1000000 for triplets, or 1:62500.  As PercussivePaul points out, this is a number that a lot of places cite. posted by specialagentwebb at 1:17 PM on March 23, 2011  Ah well, I did say I'm not great at understanding statistics. posted by pyjammy at 1:24 PM on March 23, 2011  Then, you need to look at data over a span of several decades, not just one year.  Then, you can calculate the correct odds.  Not when the alleged probability is that far off from the observed figure.  If the alleged probability were, say, 1 in 2 million, while the observed rate in 2007 was about 1 in 1 million, you're right that you'd need to collect more data.  However, if the actual probability of a birth being identical triplets is 1 in 200,000,000, then the probability of 4 or more births out of 4317119 being identical triplets is on the order of 10 -8 .  (Calculated as 1 minus the probability of having 0-3 identical triplets out of those 4317119, which in turn is sum{i=0 to 3} p i (1-p) N-1 C[N,i], where p=1/200000000, N=4317119, and C[x,y] is the binomial coefficent.)  You might object that that would be the probability in a randomly chosen year, and there may be some selection bias—no one questions the lack of identical triplets in years when that never happens.  Which would be a valid objection.  So the probability of 4 identical triplets being born in the same year any time in US history would be less than 2x10 -6 (probably much less, given that most of those years would have had far fewer than 4317119 births), if the cited probability were correct.  We can quite confidently reject the hypothesis that the probability of identical triplets is 1 in 200 million per birth in the United States without the need to collect any further data.   What you're suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 10 times, and did not get 5 heads and 5 tails, therefore the 50/50 odds of coinflips is wrong."  No, what pyjammy is suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 32 times and it came up heads 31 times and tails once, therefore this coin does not have a 0.5 probability of coming up heads on a single flip." posted by DevilsAdvocate at 1:34 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 3 favorites ]  Well, just remember that there are lies, damn lies, and statistics. Also, 23skidoo... statistics isn't about truth, it's about estimation. If you want to estimate something random, you have to measure it, and then assume a particular random process, and even then statistics will tell you how likely it is that your estimate matches your assumption.  "Makes sense" and "seems realistic" are just intuitive methods of determining the likelihood of your estimate matching an underlying process, just as statistical hypothesis testing is a mathematical method. posted by babbageboole at 1:36 PM on March 23, 2011  Does this count? I don't think so.  I know one set of triplets: the two girls are identical and there's also a boy (not identical). Is it worth mentioning they were born on February 29?  Other than the leap year business, is this more common? posted by crankyrogalsky at 2:03 PM on March 23, 2011  Even if I concede that statistics is about estimation, that's still not a reason to promote "making sense" and "seeming realistic" as good things to do when evaluating statistics, because people suck at estimating. posted by 23skidoo at 2:07 PM on March 23, 2011  that's still not a reason to promote "making sense" and "seeming realistic" as good things to do when evaluating statistics, because people suck at estimating  What? Really? If we do a calculation and come up with a figure that the average person owns 63 cars, we shouldn't ask ourselves if that makes sense as a means to evaluate whether or not the calculation was done correctly? How do you propose we detect when statistical things were figured incorrectly? The statistic of 1 in 200 million births being triplets defies expectation because (it seems) most people know a set of triplets, but we know most people don't know 200 million people. It absolutely warrants further investigation on that basis. posted by 0xFCAF at 2:20 PM on March 23, 2011  Are they genetically identical or just looks REALLY REALLY similar? Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, for example, are not genetically identical (I read somewhere in the last 2 decades.)  The New York Times mentioned it in their story about the Olsen twins in this article . Their younger sister also looks very similar to them . posted by anniecat at 2:49 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 1 favorite ]  crankyrogalsky - that is not all that uncommon, actually. "Pair and a spare" is sometimes what it's called. The birthday, however, is certainly unusual! I mean, not statistically , because I'm only guessing. posted by pyjammy at 3:18 PM on March 23, 2011  I would guess that most "identical" twins and triplets are not genetically identical. Twins run in my family quite a bit and I don't think any of them are genetic twins (based on them saying/knowing definitively they're not) although most of them do look very alike. My mom and her twin sister look identical to non family but they're not. posted by fshgrl at 3:38 PM on March 23, 2011  FWIW, unless any of your acquaintances live in Portland, I know of YET ANOTHER set of identical triplets born in 2007. posted by KathrynT at 10:10 PM on March 23, 2011  fshgrl - only fraternal twins "run" in families, identical twins/triplets are flukes. I am only counting people who knew for sure that their triplets are identical. I had mine DNA tested, but when you have 20 ultrasounds in your pregnancy, it's easy to know that they are indeed monochorionic (i.e., identical.)  kathryn - interesting! I don't think I know that set. (The ones I know all have blogs or are online in some way. If they do, you can message me.) posted by pyjammy at 4:16 AM on March 24, 2011  If we do a calculation and come up with a figure that the average person owns 63 cars, we shouldn't ask ourselves if that makes sense as a means to evaluate whether or not the calculation was done correctly?  I didn't say you shouldn't question statistics that sound way off. I said that when you hear a statistic that sounds way off, and one that you think "sounds right", you shouldn't go "Oh, the second one SEEMS right, it's probably correct". Seems right based on what? It's easy to think about whether or not you know anyone with 63 cars to give you a sense about whether that statistic is wrong. But like, what're the odds (without looking it up or doing the math) of getting a straight flush in poker? I imagine what most people think is the right answer would be really far away from the right answer. posted by 23skidoo at 8:05 AM on March 25, 2011   « Older Pirozhki Dough recipe?   |   Looking for realtime vocal feature tracking...

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

Multiple births Facts and a timeline on some of the more publicized multiple births in Canada and around the world. CBC News · Posted: Jan 27, 2009 3:52 PM ET | Last Updated: January 30, 2009 The birth of octuplets in California in January 2009 was only the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said. The mother gave birth to six boys and two girls weighing between one pound, eight ounces and three pounds, four ounces, said doctors at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center near Los Angeles. The hospital had scheduled a caesarean section for seven babies, but doctors said they were surprised when an eighth came out. In January 2008, the birth of sextuplets at a Vancouver hospital marked the first time a set of six babies has been delivered in Canada. Once an extremely rare phenomenon, fertility treatments have made multiple births slightly more common today. But conceiving sextuplets without the use of fertility treatments is extremely rare. In fact, the odds of giving birth to sextuplets spontaneously are one in 4.7 billion. The grandmother of the octuplets in Los Angeles told reporters that her daughter had fertility treatments in order to conceive. It's not known whether fertility treatments were involved in the Vancouver births. The birth of sextuplets has only been recorded approximately 160 times worldwide and few sets survived in full. Currently, the U.S. is home to six sets of sextuplets, all of which are surviving. Twins are the most common form of multiple birth and can occur naturally once in every 90 births. The odds increase for triplets and other multiple births, according to Multiple Births Canada. Spontaneously these births occur in Canada: Once in 8,100 births for triplets. Once in 729,000 births for quadruplets. Once in 65,610,000 births for quintuplets. In recent years, the incidence of multiple births in Canada is on the rise due to the increased use of fertility drugs. It is estimated that 60 per cent of triplets, 90 per cent of quadruplets and 99 per cent of quintuplets are the result of these treatments. Below is a timeline of some of the more publicized multiple births in Canada and across the world. Jan. 26, 2009: Octuplets born in California were the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said. Jan. 7, 2007 A woman gives birth to sextuplets in Vancouver resulting in Canada's first set of sextuplets. The babies were born at just 25 weeks into the mother's pregnancy. Two later died. July 28, 1999 In Saskatoon, the Gilmour family welcomed Canada's eighth set of quintuplets with the assistance of infertility treatments. Originally, six babies were conceived, but one died in the womb, leaving only five. Dec. 8-20, 1998 Octuplets were born to Nkem and Ike Chukwu in Houston, Texas, over a span of 12 days. The eldest baby was born on Dec. 8, but doctors stopped the delivery to give the remaining seven more time in the womb. The rest of the set was born on Dec. 20. A week later, the smallest of the babies died. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the first set of octuplets was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1971, although none of the babies survived. Jan. 14, 1998 The Humair septuplets made headlines when they were born in Abha, Saudi Arabia, not only because they were the second set of septuplets ever recorded, but also because they were born to a 40-year-old mother. Nov. 19, 1997 Born nine weeks premature, the McCaughey septuplets became the world's first set of seven to survive. Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey became the proud parents of the septuplets by way of fertility drugs. May 25, 1993 Holding the title of the first sextuplets born in the U.S., the Dilley sextuplets were delivered in Indiana. The four boys and two girls were conceived using an infertility treatment called Pergonal. Nov. 11, 1983 The United Kingdom received its first set of sextuplets when the Walton babies were born in Liverpool. Jan. 11, 1974 The first known sextuplets were born in Cape Town, South Africa, to Susan and Colin Rosenkowitz. May 28, 1934 Canada's most famous multiple birth, the Dionne quintuplets, were delivered in a northern Ontario farmhouse. The set would become known internationally during the Great Depression and become a tourist attraction. The quints were the world's first set to survive through infancy and were born naturally before the advent of fertility treatments. Jan. 4, 1915 The Keys quadruplets were born in Oklahoma and would grow to become the first all-female set to survive infancy and carry on into adulthood.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Abid Katib / Getty Images       More in Ages and Stages        Multiples       Through the Years     Babies     Toddlers     Preschoolers     School-Age Kids     Tweens     Teens        Quintuplets are a set of five offspring born at one birth. An individual that is part of such a set is called a quintuplet and sometimes referred to as a quint . Types of Quintuplets Quintuplets can be fraternal ( multi zygotic ), identical ( monozygotic ) or a combination of both. Multi zygotic quintuplets occur from five unique egg/sperm combinations. Monozygotic multiples are the result of a fertilized egg that splits into two or more embryos.         It is possible for a split to occur more than once, producing ​ monozygotic triplets or even a rare set of monozygotic quintuplets. Fully monozygotic quintuplets are rare, so rare that it is difficult to assess the odds. Quintuplets can be all male, all female, or a combination of both. (Monozygotic quintuplets will always be of the same gender.) Most quintuplets are a combination of boys and girls; all male or all female quintuples are rare. The first set of all-female quintuplets were born in the United States in 2015. In 2008, a Polish woman gave birth to a set of "probably identical" girls without the aid of fertility drugs. Odds of Quintuplets In 2005, the National Vital Statistics report for the United States reported the birth of 68 quintuplets and higher order multiples. Because this number includes the possible birth of sextuplets, septuplets or more, it is not determined exactly how many of those births were quintuplets.   The spontaneous conception of quintuplets is rare, the average estimate is 1 in about 60 million births. Most recent quintuplet births are the result of assisted reproductive techniques such as fertility enhancing drugs or in-vitro fertilization. Quintuplets do not always share the same birthdate. A delayed interval delivery (also known as iatrogenic asynchronous birth) may mean that individual babies are born days or even weeks apart.         Pregnancy With Quintuplets The average gestation for a quintuplet pregnancy is 29 weeks, as opposed to 40 weeks for a full-term baby. The longest gestation I've discovered was 35 weeks, a record held by the mother of the Stanford quintuplets in Rhode Island. Many mothers will gain more than fifty pounds during their pregnancy and will require cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is sewn shut to prevent preterm labor. Nearly all quintuplet pregnancies result in a cesarean delivery. The average birth weight of a quintuplet is about 2 pounds, 12 ounces and most quintuplets receive medical care in a hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) until they reach their original birth date. Dionne Quintuplets Perhaps the most famous quintuplets are the Dionne Quintuplets born in Canada in 1934. They were the first surviving set of all identical quintuplets. The girls - Annette, Émilie, Yvonne, Cécile, and Marie - attracted worldwide attention. They were removed from their parent's care and placed in the custody of a doctor, who displayed them as a tourist attraction. Interesting Facts About Quintuplets The Wilkinson quintuplets weighed more than 21 pounds combined when they were born at about 34 weeks in 2007. The heaviest quintuplet births on record, according to the Guinness Book of World Records was 25 pounds combined, attributed to two mothers, Liu Saulian (China, 1953) and Mrs. Kamalammal (India, 1956).         Parents of quintuplets will change more than 35,000 diapers before their kids are potty trained. The first set of quintuplets born in the United States were reported to be the Kanouse quints in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1875. They were all boys and did not survive. The Fischer quintuplets were the first surviving quintuplets in the United States, born in 1963 in South Dakota, according to Wikipedia. Baseball player Melvin Mora is a dad of quintuplets born in 2001 (3 girls and 2 boys). The mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics are quintuplets. A 2004 television show, "Quintuplets" starred Andy Richter and Rebecca Creskoff as parents of teenage quints.  The 1994 novel, Feather Crowns , is about a young Kentucky farm couple who gives birth to quintuplets. Support Groups for Families Are you having quintuplets? It's important for families to seek support and advice from other families in the same situation. Here are some organizations that can offer resources and assistance: MOST (Mothers of Supertwins) (United States) Multiple Births Canada's Higher Order Multiples Support Network Australian Multiple Birth Association (AMBA) New Zealand Multiple Birth Association (NZMBA) Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba) (United Kingdom) Strollers for Quintuplets Five-seat quintuplet strollers are available and are a convenient -- though pricey -- option for transporting quints. The most prevalent brand is Runabout , a company that crafts multi-seat tandem strollers with hand-welded steel frames. They are quite expensive, costing nearly $1000 new from the manufacturer, but are widely available on the secondary market. Many families find it convenient to use a combination of double and triple strollers to accommodate all five babies.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Multiple births Facts and a timeline on some of the more publicized multiple births in Canada and around the world. CBC News · Posted: Jan 27, 2009 3:52 PM ET | Last Updated: January 30, 2009 The birth of octuplets in California in January 2009 was only the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said. The mother gave birth to six boys and two girls weighing between one pound, eight ounces and three pounds, four ounces, said doctors at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center near Los Angeles. The hospital had scheduled a caesarean section for seven babies, but doctors said they were surprised when an eighth came out. In January 2008, the birth of sextuplets at a Vancouver hospital marked the first time a set of six babies has been delivered in Canada. Once an extremely rare phenomenon, fertility treatments have made multiple births slightly more common today. But conceiving sextuplets without the use of fertility treatments is extremely rare. In fact, the odds of giving birth to sextuplets spontaneously are one in 4.7 billion. The grandmother of the octuplets in Los Angeles told reporters that her daughter had fertility treatments in order to conceive. It's not known whether fertility treatments were involved in the Vancouver births. The birth of sextuplets has only been recorded approximately 160 times worldwide and few sets survived in full. Currently, the U.S. is home to six sets of sextuplets, all of which are surviving. Twins are the most common form of multiple birth and can occur naturally once in every 90 births. The odds increase for triplets and other multiple births, according to Multiple Births Canada. Spontaneously these births occur in Canada: Once in 8,100 births for triplets. Once in 729,000 births for quadruplets. Once in 65,610,000 births for quintuplets. In recent years, the incidence of multiple births in Canada is on the rise due to the increased use of fertility drugs. It is estimated that 60 per cent of triplets, 90 per cent of quadruplets and 99 per cent of quintuplets are the result of these treatments. Below is a timeline of some of the more publicized multiple births in Canada and across the world. Jan. 26, 2009: Octuplets born in California were the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said. Jan. 7, 2007 A woman gives birth to sextuplets in Vancouver resulting in Canada's first set of sextuplets. The babies were born at just 25 weeks into the mother's pregnancy. Two later died. July 28, 1999 In Saskatoon, the Gilmour family welcomed Canada's eighth set of quintuplets with the assistance of infertility treatments. Originally, six babies were conceived, but one died in the womb, leaving only five. Dec. 8-20, 1998 Octuplets were born to Nkem and Ike Chukwu in Houston, Texas, over a span of 12 days. The eldest baby was born on Dec. 8, but doctors stopped the delivery to give the remaining seven more time in the womb. The rest of the set was born on Dec. 20. A week later, the smallest of the babies died. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the first set of octuplets was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1971, although none of the babies survived. Jan. 14, 1998 The Humair septuplets made headlines when they were born in Abha, Saudi Arabia, not only because they were the second set of septuplets ever recorded, but also because they were born to a 40-year-old mother. Nov. 19, 1997 Born nine weeks premature, the McCaughey septuplets became the world's first set of seven to survive. Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey became the proud parents of the septuplets by way of fertility drugs. May 25, 1993 Holding the title of the first sextuplets born in the U.S., the Dilley sextuplets were delivered in Indiana. The four boys and two girls were conceived using an infertility treatment called Pergonal. Nov. 11, 1983 The United Kingdom received its first set of sextuplets when the Walton babies were born in Liverpool. Jan. 11, 1974 The first known sextuplets were born in Cape Town, South Africa, to Susan and Colin Rosenkowitz. May 28, 1934 Canada's most famous multiple birth, the Dionne quintuplets, were delivered in a northern Ontario farmhouse. The set would become known internationally during the Great Depression and become a tourist attraction. The quints were the world's first set to survive through infancy and were born naturally before the advent of fertility treatments. Jan. 4, 1915 The Keys quadruplets were born in Oklahoma and would grow to become the first all-female set to survive infancy and carry on into adulthood.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Credit:  Allen Jones, University Marketing, VCU Medical Center     A woman in Virginia recently gave birth to sextuplets, after she and her husband had tried to conceive for nearly two decades. But how does such a high-order pregnancy happen?  The six babies — three boys and three girls — were born on May 11 at VCU Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia. The babies ranged in size from 1 lb., 10 ounces (0.74 kilograms) to 2 lbs., 15 ounces (1.33 kg) and required a 40-person team to coordinate the delivery. Prior to this pregnancy, the mother, Ajibola Taiwo, and father, Adeboye Taiwo, had tried unsuccessfully to become pregnant for 17 years, according to VCU Medical Center.  "It's not every day that parents bring home sextuplets," Dr. Ronald Ramus, director of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at VCU Medical Center, said in a statement . "Mrs. Taiwo was eating, sleeping and breathing for seven."       Adeboye and Ajibola Taiwo are the parents of sextuplets.  Credit: Allen Jones, University Marketing, VCU Medical Center    A multiple pregnancy, in which a woman is pregnant with two or more fetuses at the same time, happens either when a fertilized egg splits before it implants in the uterus (as is the case with identical twins) or when separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm (making fraternal twins), according to the Cleveland Clinic. [ 7 Baby Myths Debunked ]  But pregnancies involving three or more fetuses are rare. Nearly 4 million live births occurred in the United States in 2015, and 3,871 of these were triplets, while 228 were quadruplets and just 24 were quintuplets or other higher-order births (like sextuplets), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It's very rare for such high-order pregnancies to happen naturally, without the help of fertility treatments .  "The chance for high-multiple gestations — four and above — to happen spontaneously, is extremely, extremely rare," said Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of Northwell Health Fertility in Manhasset, New York, who is not involved in the sextuplets' care.  Fertility drugs increase the chances of a multiple pregnancy because these medicines stimulate the ovaries to produce many eggs. If some of these many eggs are fertilized at the same time, they can result in multiple babies, according to the University of Rochester.   In vitro fertilization (IVF) can also result in a multiple pregnancy, but this is less common today than in the past. That's because, in the past, the chances of becoming pregnant with IVF were quite low, so doctors would transfer multiple embryos to the uterus to increase the chances of pregnancy, Hershlag said.  "In the early days of IVF, [it] was still responsible for a high percentage of multiples, because it was not uncommon to put [in] three, four, five or even six embryos at a time," Hershlag said. But as researchers optimized IVF techniques, they increased the likelihood that each embryo transferred would result in a pregnancy.  "Our field has now moved to strictly limit the number of embryos transferred," Hershlag told Live Science. In general, almost all younger women treated at reputable fertility centers will have a single embryo transferred, he said.  The reduction in embryos transferred during IVF has contributed to a decline in triplets and other higher-order births in the United States; from 1998 to 2015, the rate of triplets and other higher-order births in the U.S. dropped 46 percent, according to the CDC. And a 2013 study found that fertility drugs alone are responsible for a greater proportion of high-order births (triplets or more), compared with IVF.  Hershlag stressed that multiple pregnancies are associated with a higher risk of complications than single pregnancies, including an increased risk of preterm birth.  "High-multiple births is not a boon to any fertility center. This is not an achievement," Hershlag said. "While I'm wishing health and good outcomes ultimately to the couple that just gave birth to the sextuplets, I need to emphasize that such an occurrence should be long in the past. Fertility physicians should make a huge effort to transfer single embryos as much as possible."  All six babies are being treated in the neonatal intensive care unit and are doing well, VCU said. Ajibola Taiwo was released from the hospital on May 18, and she and her husband are actively participating in their babies' care, the statement said.   Original article on Live Science .

Multiples in pregnancy Twins triplets quads identical and fraternal            Home : Ovulation Planner : Duedate : Baby Names : Week by Week : Site Map :             Types of Multiples in pregnancy   A pregnancy of two or more fetuses is called a multiple pregnancy. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

This is a list of multiple births , consisting of notable higher order (4+) multiple births and pregnancies. Twins and triplets are sufficiently common to have their own separate articles. With the use of reproductive technology such as fertility drugs and in vitro fertilization (IVF) such births have become increasingly common. This list contains only multiple births which have some claim to notability, such as being the first recorded in a country, the first to survive to adulthood in a country, or the heaviest, lightest or longest lived (globally).

[1]  Dominica, 1790: According to The Times , a Dr. Giuseppe of Dominica reported that an unnamed Afro-Dominican woman (enslaved servant) living on the estate of Thomas Jemmitt gave birth to four girls, three of them almost eighteen hours after the first was born. All survived birth. [2]  The Gehri quadruplets (born September 26, 1880, in Switzerland ) were the first recorded to have survived to adulthood. There were two boys (Oskar and Arthur) and two girls (Bertha and Rosa). [3]  The Page quadruplets (born January 8, 1890, in Redwater, Texas ) were the first recorded quadruplets born in the United States. [4] [5]  The Keys quadruplets (born June 4, 1915, in Hollis, Oklahoma ) were the first same-sex quadruplets known to survive to adulthood. They attended Baylor University on scholarships and graduated in 1937. Roberta Keys Torn, the last surviving sister, died at 96 years in August 2011.

The identical sisters were born just outside Callander, Ontario , near the village of Corbeil . All five survived to adulthood.  The Dionne girls were born two months premature . After four months with their family, they were made wards of the state for the next nine years under the Dionne Quintuplets' Guardianship Act, 1935 . [1] The Ontario provincial government and those around them began to profit by making them a significant tourist attraction.  The identical quintuplet sisters were, in order of birth:   Yvonne Édouilda Marie Dionne (died 2001)  Annette Lillianne Marie Allard (living)  Cécile Marie Émilda Langlois (living)  Émilie Marie Jeanne Dionne (died 1954)  Marie Reine Alma Houle (died 1970)      Contents    1  Biography   1.1  Family  1.2  Birth  1.3  Taken from parents  1.4  At the Dafoe Nursery  1.5  Film career  1.6  Return to family  1.7  Adult years  1.8  Dionne Quints Museum    2  In popular culture  3  References  4  Bibliography  5  External links   5.1  Media       Biography [ edit ]  Family [ edit ]  The Dionne family was headed by father Oliva-Edouard (1904–1979) and mother Elzire (Legros) Dionne (1909–1986), who married on September 15, 1925. They lived just outside Corbeil , in a farmhouse in unregistered territory. Oliva, through his father, was a descendant of Zacharie Cloutier [2] (via Louise Cloutier 1632–1699, Charlotte Mignault 1669–1747, and Antoine Dionne 1641-1721). The Dionnes were a French-speaking farming family with five older children, Ernest (1926–1995), Rose Marie (1928–1995), Thérèse (b. 1929), Daniel (1932–1995), and Pauline (b. 1933), who was only eleven months older than the quintuplets. A sixth child, Léo (b. 1930), died of pneumonia shortly after birth.  The Dionnes also had three sons after the quintuplets: Oliva Jr. (1936–2017), Victor (1938–2007), and Claude (1946–2009).  Birth [ edit ]  Elzire suspected she was carrying twins, but no one was aware that quintuplets were even possible. The quintuplets were born two months premature. In 1938, the doctors had a theory that was later proven correct when genetic tests showed that the girls were identical , meaning they were created from a single egg cell. Elzire reported having had cramps in her third month and passing a strange object which may have been a sixth fetus. [3]  Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe is credited with ensuring the successful live birth of the quintuplets. Originally, he diagnosed Elzire with a "fetal abnormality". He delivered the babies with the help of two midwives, Aunt Donalda and Madame Benoit Lebel, who were summoned by Oliva Dionne in the middle of the night. [3]  Émilie and Marie shared an embryonic sac, Annette and Yvonne shared an embryonic sac, and it is believed that Cécile shared an embryonic sac with the miscarried sixth baby. [4] All but Émilie were later discovered to be right-handed [5] and all but Marie had a counter-clockwise whorl in their hair. [6] [7]  The quintuplets' total weight at birth was 13 pounds, 6 ounces. Their individual weights and measurements were not recorded. The quintuplets were immediately wrapped in cotton sheets and old napkins, and laid in the corner of the bed. Elzire went into shock, but she recovered in two hours. [3] [7]  The babies were kept in a wicker basket borrowed from the neighbours, covered with heated blankets. They were brought into the kitchen and set by the open door of the stove to keep warm. One by one, they were taken out of the basket and massaged with olive oil. Every two hours for the first twenty-four, they were fed water sweetened with corn syrup. By the second day they were moved to a slightly larger laundry basket and kept warm with hot-water bottles. They were watched constantly and often had to be roused. They were then fed with "seven-twenty" formula: cow's milk, boiled water, two spoonfuls of corn syrup, and one or two drops of rum for a stimulant. [8]  News of the unusual birth spread quickly, sparked by Oliva's brother's inquiry to the local newspaper editor about how much he would charge for an announcement of five babies at a single birth. Before long, people from all over North America were offering assistance. Individuals sent supplies and well-meant advice (a famous letter from Appalachia recommends tiny doses of burnt rye whiskey to prevent diarrhoea ); [9] one hospital sent two incubators.  Taken from parents [ edit ]     En route to Toronto for presentation to Queen Elizabeth in 1939    Oliva, already poor with five children, was approached by fair exhibitors for Chicago 's Century of Progress exhibition within days of the girls' birth, seeking to put the quintuplets on display and show them to the world. (At the time it was not unusual for so-called "incubator babies" to be displayed at fairs and other exhibitions. [10] ) The parents were persuaded to agree, and although the contract was revoked before it was ever put into effect, it raised the issue of exploitation of the children. [11]  Four months after the birth of the sisters, the Ontario government intervened and found the parents to be unfit for the quintuplets (although not for their previous children). Custody of the five babies was withdrawn from their parents by the Lieutenant Governor - in-Council , on the advice of Premier  Mitchell Hepburn , in 1935. The guardianship was initially for two years. Although Oliva Dionne remained part of the guardianship, the children were put under the guidance of Dr. Dafoe and two others. The stated reason for removing the quintuplets from their parents' legal custody was to ensure their survival.  The government realised there was massive public interest in the sisters and proceeded to engender a tourist industry around them. [12] The girls were made wards of the provincial Crown , planned until they reached the age of 18. [ citation needed ]  At the Dafoe Nursery [ edit ]  Across the road from their birthplace, the Dafoe Hospital and Nursery was built for the five girls and their new caregivers. The girls were moved from the farmhouse to this nursery at the end of September and lived there until they were nine years old. [12] The compound had an outdoor playground designed to be a public observation area. It was surrounded by a covered arcade, which allowed tourists to observe the sisters behind one-way screens. The facility was funded by a Red Cross fundraiser. It was a nine-room nursery with a staff house nearby. The staff house held the three nurses and the three policemen in charge of guarding them, while a housekeeper and two maids lived in the main building with the quintuplets. The buildings were surrounded by a seven-foot barbed-wire fence. The sisters were brought to the playground for thirty minutes two or three times a day. [ citation needed ]  The Dionne sisters were constantly tested, studied, and examined, with records being taken of everything. While living at the compound, they had a somewhat rigid lifestyle. They were not required to participate in chores and were privately tutored in the same building where they lived. Cared for primarily by nurses, they had limited exposure to the world outside the boundaries of the compound except for the daily rounds of tourists, who, from the sisters' point of view, were generally heard but not seen. [12] They also had occasional contact with their parents and siblings across the road. Every morning they dressed together in a big bathroom, had doses of orange juice and cod-liver oil, and then went to have their hair curled. They then said a prayer, a gong was sounded, and they ate breakfast in the dining room. After thirty minutes, they had to clear the table. They then went and played in the sunroom for thirty minutes, took a fifteen-minute break, and at nine o'clock had their morning inspection with Dr. Dafoe. Every month they had a different timetable of activities. They bathed every day before dinner and put on their pajamas. Dinner was served at precisely six o'clock. They then went into the quiet playroom to say their evening prayers. Each girl had a colour and a symbol to mark whatever belonged to her. Annette's colour was red and her design a maple leaf, Cecile's green and a turkey. Emilie had white and a tulip, Marie blue and a teddy bear, and Yvonne pink and a bluebird. [13]  Approximately 6,000 people per day visited the observation gallery that surrounded the outdoor playground to view the Dionne sisters. Ample parking was provided and almost 3,000,000 people walked through the gallery between 1936 and 1943. Oliva Dionne ran a souvenir shop and a concession store opposite the nursery and the area acquired the name "Quintland". The souvenirs, picturing the five sisters, included autographs and framed photographs, spoons, cups, plates, plaques, candy bars, books, postcards and dolls. Oliva also sold stones from the Dionne farm that were supposed to have a magical power of fertility. Midwives Madame LeGros and Madame LeBelle also opened their own souvenir and dining stand. [14] The quintuplets brought in more than $50 million in total tourist revenue to Ontario. [15] Quintland became Ontario's biggest tourist attraction of the era, surpassing the Canadian side of Niagara Falls . [ citation needed ] It was only rivaled by Radio City Music Hall , Mount Vernon , and Gettysburg in the United States. Hollywood stars who came to Callander to visit the Quints included Clark Gable , James Stewart , Bette Davis , James Cagney , and Mae West . Amelia Earhart also visited Callander just six weeks before her ill-fated flight in 1937. [ citation needed ]  The sisters, their likenesses and images, along with Dr. Dafoe, were used to publicize commercial products including Karo  corn syrup and Quaker Oats . They increased the sales of condensed milk, toothpaste, disinfectant, and many other products through their promotions. [ citation needed ]  Film career [ edit ]  The Dionne girls starred in three Hollywood feature films, which were essentially fictionalised versions of their story. They played the 'Wyatt Quintuplets' in all three films:   The Country Doctor (1936) – directed by Henry King and starring Jean Hersholt  Five of a Kind (1938) - The sequel to the above film.  Reunion (1936) [16]   In the first two films, the Dionne quintuplets didn't so much act as simply appear. Their scenes were filmed at Quintland in Callendar, and largely consisted of them playing and interacting with each other, as one would expect of normal 2- and 4-year-old children. Both films concentrated more on telling the (fictionalized) story of the heroic doctor who delivered the Wyatts and took care of them, than it did on the Wyatt quintuplets themselves. [ citation needed ]  The Dionne quintuplets also appeared in numerous newsreels and a short documentary film called Five Times Five in 1939. This film was nominated for an Oscar in 1940. [ citation needed ] In 1942, they appeared in one of James A. Fitzpatrick's Traveltalks  Land of the Quintuplets shortly before they were returned to their parents. In 1998, the three surviving sisters, Cécile, Annette and Yvonne, participated in an hour-long documentary, "Full Circle: The Untold Story of the Dionne Quintuplets", written and directed by Maya Gallus , and broadcast on the CBC documentary series Life & Times . [ citation needed ]  Return to family [ edit ]     The quintuplets in 1947 with their parents and a priest in the background    In November 1943, the Dionne parents won back custody of the sisters. The entire family moved into a newly built house within walking distance of Quintland. The yellow brick, 20-room mansion was paid for out of the quintuplets' fund. The home had many amenities that were considered luxuries at the time, including telephones, electricity and hot water and was nicknamed "The Big House". The building is now a retirement home. [17]  The nursery was eventually converted into an accredited school house where the sisters finished their secondary education along with ten girls from the area who were chosen to attend. In later years, it was used by the Recluses of Corbeil as a convent. [ citation needed ]  While the parents claimed that they wished to integrate the quintuplets into the family, the sisters frequently travelled to perform at various functions, still dressed identically. According to the accounts of the surviving sisters, the parents often treated them at home as a five-part unit, and frequently lectured them about the trouble they had caused the family by existing. They were sometimes denied privileges the other children received, and were more strictly disciplined and punished. They also received a heavier share of the housework and farmwork. [ citation needed ] They were unaware for many years that the lavish house, the expensive food and the series of cars the family enjoyed were paid for with money they themselves had earned. [ citation needed ]  In particular, Oliva Dionne was resentful and suspicious of outsiders as a result of his having lost custody of the girls. In 1995, the three surviving sisters alleged that their father had sexually abused them during their teenaged years. [18]  Adult years [ edit ]  The quintuplets left the family home upon turning 18 years old in 1952 and had little contact with their parents afterwards. Three went on to marry and have children: Marie had two daughters, Annette three sons, and Cécile five children, including one who died in infancy and twins Bruno and Bertrand. [19] Émilie devoted her brief life to becoming a nun . Yvonne finished nursing school before turning to sculpting, then later becoming a librarian. [20] Émilie died at the age of 20 as a result of a seizure. She had a series of seizures while she was a postulant at a convent and had asked not to be left unattended, but the nun who was supposed to be watching her thought she was asleep and went to Mass . Émilie had another seizure, rolled onto her belly and, unable to raise her face from her pillow, accidentally suffocated. [21] In 1970, Marie was living alone in an apartment and her sisters were worried after not hearing from her in several days. Her doctor went to her home and found her in bed, Marie having been dead for days. Her estranged husband quickly reported to the media that there had been a blood clot in her brain. [ citation needed ]  Annette and Cécile both eventually divorced and by the 1990s, the three surviving sisters lived together in the Montreal suburb of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville . [ citation needed ]  In 1965, author James Brough wrote a book, in cooperation with the then four surviving sisters, called We Were Five . Pierre Berton published a biography called The Dionne Years: A Thirties Melodrama in 1977 and narrated a 1978 National Film Board of Canada documentary. [ citation needed ] John Nihmey and Stuart Foxman published the fictional Time of Their Lives — The Dionne Tragedy in 1986. Nihmey and Foxman's book was the basis for the 1994 TV miniseries Million Dollar Babies (1994), produced by CBC Television and CBS Television and starring Beau Bridges , Roy Dupuis and Céline Bonnier . [ citation needed ]  In 1997, the three surviving sisters wrote an open letter to the parents of the McCaughey septuplets , warning against allowing too much publicity for the children. The letter read: [22] [23]   Dear Bobbi and Kenny,  If we emerge momentarily from the privacy we have sought all our adult lives, it is only to send a message to the McCaughey family. We three would like you to know we feel a natural affinity and tenderness for your children. We hope your children receive more respect than we did. Their fate should be no different from that of other children. Multiple births should not be confused with entertainment, nor should they be an opportunity to sell products.  Our lives have been ruined by the exploitation we suffered at the hands of the government of Ontario, our place of birth. We were displayed as a curiosity three times a day for millions of tourists. To this day we receive letters from all over the world. To all those who have expressed their support in light of the abuse we have endured, we say thank you. And to those who would seek to exploit the growing fame of these children, we say beware.  We sincerely hope a lesson will be learned from examining how our lives were forever altered by our childhood experience. If this letter changes the course of events for these newborns, then perhaps our lives will have served a higher purpose.  Sincerely, Annette, Cécile and Yvonne Dionne   In 1998, the sisters reached a $2.8 million settlement with the Ontario government as compensation for their exploitation. [24] [25]  As of December 2017 there are two surviving sisters, Annette and Cécile. Yvonne died in 2001. [26]  Dionne Quints Museum [ edit ]  A sibling of the quintuplets was the first to open the Dionne home as a museum. [ citation needed ] The original family homestead was moved around 1960 to a location on Highway 11B (near the present Clarion Resort ), and again in 1985 to North Bay and converted into the non-profit Dionne Quintuplets Museum. The museum is located at the intersection of Highway 11 and the Trans Canada Highway and features many artifacts from the quints' early days and their growing years. As of October, 2016, the museum is now closed, and the city of North Bay is considering selling the building as surplus, though a petition is being circulated by citizens to have it designated and preserved as a historical structure. In 2017, plans surfaced for the city to sell the building, and relocate it to a fairground in the village of Sundridge 75 km south of North Bay. [12] On November 9, 2017 the City of North Bay announced plans to move the house on November 19 to a new site in downtown North Bay (on Oak Street in a vacant area between Marina Point Retirement Residence and Discovery North Bay Museum , a former CPR Station c. 1903) and will re-open in May 2018. [27]  In popular culture [ edit ]      Dionne Quintuplets – School Days , painting by Andrew Loomis, 1938    Canadian mystery writer Louise Penny said the fictional Ouellet quintuplets in her book How The Light Gets In "were certainly inspired by the Dionne girls". [28]  Stephen Sondheim referenced the quintuplets in his song " I'm Still Here " from the musical Follies with the line "I got through Abie's Irish Rose , five Dionne babies, Major Bowes ...". [29]  The fourth episode of the Amazon television series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is called "The Disappointment of the Dionne Quintuplets". Three of the Dionne Quintuplets were referenced by Curly Howard in a 'Three Stooges' episode entitled 'False Alarms', aired August 15, 1936.  In 2018, the birth of the quints was named a National Historic Event . [30]  References [ edit ]    ^  Lillian Barker (1951). The Dionne Legend: Quintuplets in Captivity .

(July 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The Genain quadruplets (born in 1930) are a set of identical quadruplet sisters. All four developed schizophrenia , suggesting a large genetic component to the cause of the disease. [1] The pseudonym Genain , used to protect the identity of the family, comes from the Greek , meaning dire (αἶνος) birth (γεν-). [1] The sisters were given the pseudonyms Nora, Iris, Myra and Hester, to represent each of the four letters in NIMH, the acronym for the United States  National Institute of Mental Health . [1] Nora, Iris, and Hester were hospitalized for their schizophrenia at least once each. [1] As of 2011, Iris and Hester have died [2]     Contents    1  Personal lives  2  Illness and scientific research  3  References  4  Further reading     Personal lives [ edit ]  The sisters were born in a midwestern American town (nicknamed “Envira”) on April 14, 1930. [3] They were considered local celebrities due to the quadruple nature of their birth. [3]  The four sisters grew up with their parents in the same household. The Genain sisters' parents were described as "disturbed". [1] Their paternal grandmother may have had paranoid schizophrenia, and their father was described as abusive. Myra and Nora were probably treated more favorably by their parents, while Iris and Hester were treated more harshly. [3] The parents considered Hester to be a “habitual masturbator” [1] and referred to her as a “moron type” or “sex maniac”. [3] Iris and Hester were both circumcised as children in order to prevent them from masturbation. [4] [3] The quadruplets were reportedly physically abused by their father, pseudonymed as Mr. Genain .  Subsequently, the Genains accepted an offer by the NIMH to take the daughters into their clinic and each was diagnosed with schizophrenia.  All of the sisters except Hester graduated from high school. [3]  Myra worked as a secretary for most of her life. She married and had two sons. [3] When she grew older, she frequently visited her sisters Nora and Hester. Her eldest son contracted HIV after a blood transfusion and died in 1996, while her younger son became a maintenance worker and retained a close relationship with his mother. [3] Nora later managed the income the sisters received for having their photograph published in textbooks. [3] Iris worked as a beautician for a while but most of her adult life was spent institutionalized. [5]  Illness and scientific research [ edit ]  All four of the sisters developed schizophrenia by the age of 24. [3]  There was a history of mental illness in Mr. Genain's family that might have been an example of genetics being linked with mental illness or it may have just been a dysfunctional and abusive family free from a specific genetic component.  Mr. Genain's mother had had a three-year nervous breakdown in her late teens. The NIMH had recorded behaviors in Mr. Genain's siblings indicative of mental illness.

More in Ages and Stages        Multiples       Through the Years     Babies     Toddlers     Preschoolers     School-Age Kids     Tweens     Teens        Sextuplets are a set of six offspring born at one birth. An individual that is part of such a set is called a sextuplet . Types Sextuplets can be fraternal (multizygotic), identical (monozygotic) or a combination of both. Multizygotic sextuplets occur from six unique egg/sperm combinations. Monozygotic multiples are the result of a fertilized egg that splits into two or more embryos. It is possible for the split to occur more than once, producing monozygotic triplets or potentially even a set of monozygotic sextuplets, although none have been documented.         It is also possible for sextuplets to include one or more sets of monozygotic twins among the six individuals. Sextuplets can be all male, all female, or a combination of both. Monozygotic multiples will always be of the same gender. Statistics Facts About Multiples records 179 sets of sextuplets in the world as of November 2007. The first surviving set of sextuplets was born in South Africa in 1974. The first surviving set of sextuplets from the United States were the Dilley sextuplets born in 1993, often referred to as the "Dilley Six Pack". Very few incidences of spontaneous conception of sextuplets have been reported; nearly all of the sextuplet births in the last 30 years were the result of fertility enhancements such as ovulation-stimulating drugs. Sextuplets do not necessarily have to share the same birthdate. A delayed interval delivery (also known as iatrogenic asynchronous birth) may mean that individual babies are born days or even weeks apart, such as the Van Houten babies born in 2004.   Pregnancy The average gestation for a sextuplet pregnancy is 29.1 weeks, as opposed to 40 weeks for a full-term baby. During a pregnancy with sextuplets, a mother will gain 40-100 pounds. According to Mothers of Super Twins (MOST), the average weight gain is 55 pounds. Many mothers will require cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is sewn shut to prevent preterm labor .         Nearly all sextuplet pregnancies result in a caesarean delivery; only 3 cases of natural delivery of sextuplets are cited at Facts About Multiples. The average birthweight of a sextuplet is about 2 1/2 pounds, and nearly all sextuplets require medical care in a hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) for several weeks to months after birth. Interesting Facts Sextuplets have been widely followed in the media, from the Dilley "Six Pack" born in 1993 to the television series "Jon & Kate Plus 8" which documents the daily life of the Gosselin family who have both twins and sextuplets. Six sets of sextuplets were born in the United States in 2004. The Walton sextuplets of Great Britain were the first surviving set of all-female sextuplets; there are no known surviving sets of all male sextuplets. There were two sextuplet births on June 10, 2007: the Masches in Arizona and the Morrisons in Minnesota (only one of the Morrison babies survived.) Many parents of sextuplets are urged to consider selective reduction, reducing the number of viable fetuses to two in order to protect the health of the mother and give the babies the best chance of survival. Many parents of sextuplets have deep religious convictions that preclude them from seeking a reduction, and their faith sustains them through their extreme pregnancy.         Support Groups Are you having sextuplets? It's important for families to seek support and advice from other families in the same situation. Here are some organizations that can offer resources and assistance: MOST (Mothers of Supertwins : http://www.mostonline.org/index.htm (United States) Multiple Births Canada's Higher Order Multiples Support Network:  http://multiplebirthscanada.org/index.php/parents/support/higher-order-multiples-support-network (Canada) The Triplet Connection : http://www.tripletconnection.org/ (United States) National Organization of Mothers of Twins Clubs (NOMOTC):  http://www.multiplesofamerica.org/ (United States) Australian Multiple Birth Association (AMBA):  http://www.amba.org.au/ (Australia) New Zealand Mutiple Birth Association (NZMBA):  http://www.nzmba.info/ (New Zealand) Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba):  https://www.tamba.org.uk/big-research-appeal?tab=1 (United Kingdom)  Strollers Six-seat strollers are available and are a convenient -- though pricey -- option for transporting six babies. Runabout crafts multi-seat strollers with hand-welded steel frames and manufactures a model with six seats. They are quite expensive, costing nearly $1500 new from the manufacturer, but may be available on the secondary market. (Triplet Connection also offers discounts for parents of multiples.)

By Sarah Westcott     PUBLISHED:  00:00, Sat, May 23, 2009               MIRACLE: The six babies are thought to be the UK’s only naturally conceived sextuplets (Pic posed by     The six babies, thought to be the UK’s only
naturally conceived sextuplets, were delivered by ­caesarean section
within five minutes of each other.  The four
girls and two boys were 14 weeks premature and weigh between 1lb 7oz
and 2lb 2oz. Last night they were being monitored in an intensive care
unit.  Neonatal consultant Clifford Mayes, who
led the 30-strong delivery team at the Royal ­Hospital in Belfast,
said: “This is both a happy time and a potentially difficult time.  “It
is an extraordinary thing to have witnessed but you are also struck by
the fact that there are little babies in intensive care.”  Lead
midwife Patricia Denvir said: “It was a very stressful situation for
staff and for the parents, but it went very well. Both parents were
composed.”  Britain’s last sextuplets were girls born in 1983 to Janet Walton, who had fertility treatment.    Their
father Graham Walton, 58, said yesterday: “The new parents will have to
be organised. There was so much to do and think about and there was
never enough time.  “But all you can do is keep smiling and enjoy every minute of it.”  Sextuplets occur naturally in one out of 4.5million pregnancies but fertility treatments have led to a rise in multiple births.  However, the babies were conceived naturally without the aid of IVF.  Dr
Mayes said there had been weeks of preparation involving experts from
across the country working to ensure the babies arrived safely.    The
birth “went as well as we had hoped it would,” he said. “The care of
the babies would be the care we would normally expect for any baby.”  Dr
Mayes said it would be impossible for a woman to go full term with six
babies – she might make 30 weeks at best – but the mother had carried
them for 26 weeks. Midwife Mrs Denvir added: “The mother was very
composed. Under a very stressful situation both parents were very
composed and they dealt with it very well.  “It is a very emotional time but it’s also very stressful for all concerned.”  Keith
Reed, chief executive of the Twins and Multiple Births Association,
said the case was unique in the UK and described the babies as
“miracles”.    He said: “This is wonderful news
and everyone in the multiple birth community will be keeping their
fingers crossed that mother and babies thrive.  “Around
half of the 11,000 multiple births each year are premature resulting in
one or more of their babies being cared for in a Neo Natal Intensive
Care Unit so our families understand the roller coaster of emotions
this family will be on.”  The news follows the case of single mother Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to octuplets in California in January.  Britain’s
most famous multiple birth mother is probably Mandy Allwood, who in
1996 miscarried all eight of her babies at 19 weeks.    But in 1983 the Walton sextuplets were born in Liverpool. Hannah, Lucy, Ruth, Sarah, Kate and Jenny are now 25.  Sextuplet
father Mr Walton, 58, added: “My wife is so very organised. We had to
be, changing nappies, feeding, sleeping, at all hours of the day and
night.  “There was always so much to think about and never enough time to do it.  “All
I can say to them is that there will be lots of tears, as with any
family, but there will also be lots of fun and special times ahead.”  on pregnancies but fertility treatments have led to a rise in multiple births.

March 23, 2011 12:16 PM   Subscribe  What are the odds, really, of having identical triplets?   Okay, I'm not really asking for the odds, but I do want to be able to dispute a statistic that is often quoted  in  the media and by other people.  It is often said that the odds of having identical triplets are 1:200 million. Which to me sounds ridiculous, but I'm not sure if my reasoning is sound.  We have identical triplets, born in December of 2007. I know of several other sets, also born in 2007. At least 3 (one set in 4/2007, one in 8/2007, and another set in 12/2007.) These are only ones I've met online. I'm assuming there are more out there.   According to the CDC , there were 4,317,119 births in 2007. (I don't know if they count a multiples birth as one, or if it's one per kid, but I don't think that really matters for the purposes of this question.) Four of those, at least, were ID triplets. That's more like 1:1,000,000, and those are only the sets I know. So it's likely to be even less than that. Right?  I'm just annoyed by reading that 1:200 million  statistic, and would like to be able to refute it intelligently.  (I'm just posting information from 2007 since that's what I have, but I assume the birth rates are the same every year.)  As you can tell from a previous question , I don't really understand probability and statistics all that well. So use layman's terms, if you don't mind.  posted by pyjammy to Science & Nature (24 answers total) 2 users marked this as a favorite           you need to find out, from the CDC or whomever tracks those birth statistics, how many of those births were triplets.  Then, you need to look at data over a span of several decades, not just one year.  Then, you can calculate the correct odds.  What you're suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 10 times, and did not get 5 heads and 5 tails, therefore the 50/50 odds of coinflips is wrong." posted by k5.user at 12:24 PM on March 23, 2011  Here's two data points:   The National Center for Health Statistics says there were 294 sets of triplets born in the United States in 1944 out of a total of 2,794,800 births.  There is no record of how many of the 294 were identical triples. But Dr. Louis G. Keith of the Northwestern University Medical School, who has written extensively on this subject, believes most of those 294 were probably identical.  With fertility treatments affecting birth rates now, in 2002 there were 6,898 sets of triplets out of 4,021,726 births in the U.S. and again, there is no record of how many of these were identical. Fertility treatments do not cause identical triplets to be born as they utilize individual eggs for their zygotes. Identical triplets are mono-zygotic (a single zygote which splits into three). So with more triplets being born and the rate of identical triplets staying the same, identical triplets are more rare now than they were back in 1944.  The odds of conceiving "spontaneous" triplets is about 1 in 8,100. In the early '80s, triplets occurred 1 in every 6,400. Today, odds are that 1 in every 1,300 are triplets. Over the last decade, increases in the number of triplet births averaged 11 percent a year.  The 1 in 200 million quote seems completely fabricated, if "most" triplets born pre-fertility-drugs were identical. However, keep in mind triplets born in 2007 are still fairly young; they might not look as identical as they get older. We'll need DNA tests to be sure. posted by gerryblog at 12:28 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 3 favorites ]  Are they genetically identical or just looks REALLY REALLY similar? Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, for example, are not genetically identical (I read somewhere in the last 2 decades.) posted by k8t at 12:29 PM on March 23, 2011  According to this page identical triplets occur in 1 in 62500 pregnancies.  It looks truthy and facty to me, though who knows. posted by PercussivePaul at 12:35 PM on March 23, 2011  Based on UK statistics (2009, Office of National Statistics, General Registry Office Scotland and GRO Northern Ireland), the rate of any twin is 16 in 1000 births, and the rate of identical twins is 1/3 that, or figure 5 in 1000 births.  I think the formation of an identical triplet would require first the formation of an identical twin, and then one of those twins to form another identical twin. So my estimate would be 5 in one million. posted by babbageboole at 12:37 PM on March 23, 2011  And, of course, I can't multiply. I meant 25 in one million, or 1 in 40,000. That seems a bit high, though. posted by babbageboole at 12:38 PM on March 23, 2011  gerryblog - that's a great article!  k8 - send me your address and I'll send you one.  PercussivePaul, I've always liked that statistic. It seems more realistic to me. That's the one I generally tell people when they ask how rare it is. I think I must have gotten it from that same page.  Babbageboole, I like the way you came up with that. That makes sense to me. posted by pyjammy at 12:47 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 2 favorites ]  If the odds of having identical triplets were one in 200 million, there would be about thirty-five sets of them in the world -- seven billion divided by 200 million. This seems unreasonably low.  babbageboole: there's something called "Hellin's Law" which is a rule of thumb for the incidence of all multiple births, not just identical ones; it states that the frequency of twins is one in 89, of triplets is one in 89 2 , and so on. This agrees with your intuition but I don't know enough about the mechanism to say whether it would apply specifically to identical multiple births. posted by madcaptenor at 12:49 PM on March 23, 2011  Statistics are either true or false. Just because something "makes sense" or "seems more realistic" doesn't mean that it's any more likely to be true. posted by 23skidoo at 12:51 PM on March 23, 2011  23skidoo - really? What about incorrect statistics, like the one my question is about? posted by pyjammy at 12:54 PM on March 23, 2011  It's incorrect if someone shows it to be incorrect. It's not incorrect just because it seems wrong. posted by 23skidoo at 1:06 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 4 favorites ]  I'm seeing statistic similar to babbage's: worldwide, the rate for monozygotic twins is 4 in 1000, which (in theory) calculates out to 16:1000000 for triplets, or 1:62500.  As PercussivePaul points out, this is a number that a lot of places cite. posted by specialagentwebb at 1:17 PM on March 23, 2011  Ah well, I did say I'm not great at understanding statistics. posted by pyjammy at 1:24 PM on March 23, 2011  Then, you need to look at data over a span of several decades, not just one year.  Then, you can calculate the correct odds.  Not when the alleged probability is that far off from the observed figure.  If the alleged probability were, say, 1 in 2 million, while the observed rate in 2007 was about 1 in 1 million, you're right that you'd need to collect more data.  However, if the actual probability of a birth being identical triplets is 1 in 200,000,000, then the probability of 4 or more births out of 4317119 being identical triplets is on the order of 10 -8 .  (Calculated as 1 minus the probability of having 0-3 identical triplets out of those 4317119, which in turn is sum{i=0 to 3} p i (1-p) N-1 C[N,i], where p=1/200000000, N=4317119, and C[x,y] is the binomial coefficent.)  You might object that that would be the probability in a randomly chosen year, and there may be some selection bias—no one questions the lack of identical triplets in years when that never happens.  Which would be a valid objection.  So the probability of 4 identical triplets being born in the same year any time in US history would be less than 2x10 -6 (probably much less, given that most of those years would have had far fewer than 4317119 births), if the cited probability were correct.  We can quite confidently reject the hypothesis that the probability of identical triplets is 1 in 200 million per birth in the United States without the need to collect any further data.   What you're suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 10 times, and did not get 5 heads and 5 tails, therefore the 50/50 odds of coinflips is wrong."  No, what pyjammy is suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 32 times and it came up heads 31 times and tails once, therefore this coin does not have a 0.5 probability of coming up heads on a single flip." posted by DevilsAdvocate at 1:34 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 3 favorites ]  Well, just remember that there are lies, damn lies, and statistics. Also, 23skidoo... statistics isn't about truth, it's about estimation. If you want to estimate something random, you have to measure it, and then assume a particular random process, and even then statistics will tell you how likely it is that your estimate matches your assumption.  "Makes sense" and "seems realistic" are just intuitive methods of determining the likelihood of your estimate matching an underlying process, just as statistical hypothesis testing is a mathematical method. posted by babbageboole at 1:36 PM on March 23, 2011  Does this count? I don't think so.  I know one set of triplets: the two girls are identical and there's also a boy (not identical). Is it worth mentioning they were born on February 29?  Other than the leap year business, is this more common? posted by crankyrogalsky at 2:03 PM on March 23, 2011  Even if I concede that statistics is about estimation, that's still not a reason to promote "making sense" and "seeming realistic" as good things to do when evaluating statistics, because people suck at estimating. posted by 23skidoo at 2:07 PM on March 23, 2011  that's still not a reason to promote "making sense" and "seeming realistic" as good things to do when evaluating statistics, because people suck at estimating  What? Really? If we do a calculation and come up with a figure that the average person owns 63 cars, we shouldn't ask ourselves if that makes sense as a means to evaluate whether or not the calculation was done correctly? How do you propose we detect when statistical things were figured incorrectly? The statistic of 1 in 200 million births being triplets defies expectation because (it seems) most people know a set of triplets, but we know most people don't know 200 million people. It absolutely warrants further investigation on that basis. posted by 0xFCAF at 2:20 PM on March 23, 2011  Are they genetically identical or just looks REALLY REALLY similar? Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, for example, are not genetically identical (I read somewhere in the last 2 decades.)  The New York Times mentioned it in their story about the Olsen twins in this article . Their younger sister also looks very similar to them . posted by anniecat at 2:49 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 1 favorite ]  crankyrogalsky - that is not all that uncommon, actually. "Pair and a spare" is sometimes what it's called. The birthday, however, is certainly unusual! I mean, not statistically , because I'm only guessing. posted by pyjammy at 3:18 PM on March 23, 2011  I would guess that most "identical" twins and triplets are not genetically identical. Twins run in my family quite a bit and I don't think any of them are genetic twins (based on them saying/knowing definitively they're not) although most of them do look very alike. My mom and her twin sister look identical to non family but they're not. posted by fshgrl at 3:38 PM on March 23, 2011  FWIW, unless any of your acquaintances live in Portland, I know of YET ANOTHER set of identical triplets born in 2007. posted by KathrynT at 10:10 PM on March 23, 2011  fshgrl - only fraternal twins "run" in families, identical twins/triplets are flukes. I am only counting people who knew for sure that their triplets are identical. I had mine DNA tested, but when you have 20 ultrasounds in your pregnancy, it's easy to know that they are indeed monochorionic (i.e., identical.)  kathryn - interesting! I don't think I know that set. (The ones I know all have blogs or are online in some way. If they do, you can message me.) posted by pyjammy at 4:16 AM on March 24, 2011  If we do a calculation and come up with a figure that the average person owns 63 cars, we shouldn't ask ourselves if that makes sense as a means to evaluate whether or not the calculation was done correctly?  I didn't say you shouldn't question statistics that sound way off. I said that when you hear a statistic that sounds way off, and one that you think "sounds right", you shouldn't go "Oh, the second one SEEMS right, it's probably correct". Seems right based on what? It's easy to think about whether or not you know anyone with 63 cars to give you a sense about whether that statistic is wrong. But like, what're the odds (without looking it up or doing the math) of getting a straight flush in poker? I imagine what most people think is the right answer would be really far away from the right answer. posted by 23skidoo at 8:05 AM on March 25, 2011   « Older Pirozhki Dough recipe?   |   Looking for realtime vocal feature tracking...

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.
