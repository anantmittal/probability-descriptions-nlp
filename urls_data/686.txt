However, most medications, including antibiotics and birth control pills, don't affect the accuracy of home pregnancy tests.   Could a positive result be wrong?    Although rare, it's possible to get a positive result from a home pregnancy test when you're not actually pregnant. This is known as a false-positive.  A false-positive might happen if you had a pregnancy loss soon after the fertilized egg attached to your uterine lining (biochemical pregnancy) or you take a pregnancy test too soon after taking a fertility drug that contains HCG. An ectopic pregnancy, menopause or problems with your ovaries also might contribute to misleading test results.   Could a negative result be wrong?    It's possible to get a negative result from a home pregnancy test when you're actually pregnant. This is known as a false-negative — and it's much more likely to occur than is a false-positive. You might get a false-negative if you:   Take the test too early. The earlier after a missed period that you take a home pregnancy test, the harder it is for the test to detect HCG. For the most accurate results, take the test one week after a missed period — when the level of HCG in your urine is most likely to be detectable. If you can't wait that long, ask your health care provider for a blood test.  Check test results too soon. Be sure to give the test time to work. Consider setting a timer according to the package instructions.  Use diluted urine. For the most accurate results, take the test first thing in the morning — when your urine is the most concentrated.   What happens next?    Based on your test results, consider taking the following steps:   Your home pregnancy test is positive, or you've taken a few home pregnancy tests and gotten mixed results. Make an appointment with your health care provider. You might need a blood test or ultrasound to confirm your pregnancy. The sooner your pregnancy is confirmed, the sooner you can begin prenatal care.  Your home pregnancy test is negative. If your period doesn't begin, repeat the test in a few days or one week — especially if you took the test before or shortly after a missed period.  You continue to get negative test results, but your period doesn't begin or you still think you might be pregnant. Check with your health care provider. Many factors can lead to missed menstrual periods (amenorrhea), including thyroid disorders, low body weight, problems with your ovaries, excessive exercise and stress. If you're not pregnant, your health care provider can help you get your menstrual cycle back on track.    Previous  Share Tweet  Dec. 02, 2015  References   Bastian LA, et al.

The BabyCenter Editorial Team     The accuracy of a home pregnancy test depends on how and when you take the test, so it's possible that your negative pregnancy test result is not be accurate. What's a false negative pregnancy test result? A "false negative" pregnancy test result shows that you're not pregnant when you are. Why do false negative pregnancy test results happen? The test was taken too soon. If you take a home pregnancy test very soon after you think you may have conceived , or if you didn't follow the test instructions correctly, you might get a false negative test result. A home pregnancy test will be positive only if it detects the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). When an egg is fertilized after you ovulate , it takes about a week to travel through a fallopian tube to the uterus. And your body starts producing hCG only after a fertilized egg implants in the uterus . If it's very early in your pregnancy, your body might not have produced enough hCG yet. In that case, you'd get a negative result at first. Also, some tests are more sensitive than others, and no test is 100 percent accurate. And a few women have such low levels of hCG during pregnancy that home tests can't measure it. Although some tests can detect hCG the first day you miss your period, you'll have a better chance of getting an accurate result if you wait a week. Don't time the test based on when you think you might have conceived. Sperm can live in the fallopian tubes for up to five days, so it's possible you conceived several days after having sex. Hormones were low. For the most accurate result, follow the test instructions exactly, and take the test when you first get up in the morning. That's the time when your urine – and any hCG – is the most concentrated. What if the test is taken correctly and I get a negative result? If you're sure you've waited long enough to test and you're still getting a negative result , you're probably not pregnant. Pregnancy isn't the only reason for a missed period – stress, too much exercise, and thyroid problems, among other things, can all delay menstruation. If your period is weeks late without a positive test result, talk to your doctor to figure out whether you're pregnant or need help getting your menstrual cycle on track.

This is most often in one of your fallopian tubes. The fertilised egg can’t survive and you may need immediate treatment to prevent any complications.                           About ectopic pregnancy  In a usual, healthy pregnancy, an egg released by your ovary is fertilised by sperm in one of your fallopian tubes. It then travels to your womb where it implants in the lining and grows into a baby.  About one in every 100 pregnancies is ectopic, which means the fertilised egg implants outside your womb (uterus). Most often it implants in one of your fallopian tubes. Other places include:   at the point where your fallopian tube meets your womb  in one of your ovaries  at the neck of your womb (cervix)  in your abdomen (tummy)  in a caesarean scar    Unfortunately, the fertilised egg can’t survive. The pregnancy may end by itself or it could continue to grow. You may need immediate treatment to prevent any complications. If the egg keeps growing, it can split open (rupture) the fallopian tube and cause life-threatening internal bleeding.  Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy  Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy usually appear about six to eight weeks after you last had a period. There are three common symptoms:   not having periods  pelvic or abdominal (tummy) pain – this is usually on one side although it can spread across both  unusual bleeding from your vagina – the blood is often likened to prune juice and may or may not contain clots    However, not all women get these symptoms. Two in every 10 women with ectopic pregnancy don’t have bleeding and one in every 10 women doesn’t have pain.  Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are similar to those of a miscarriage and you and your doctor may not be able to tell the difference at first.  As they grow, ectopic pregnancies can bleed and eventually rupture. This may cause:   pain in the tip of your shoulder – this is caused by bleeding into your abdomen, which irritates nerves that run to your shoulder  feeling dizzy or faint – a ruptured fallopian tube can lead to serious internal bleeding,  causing you to collapse  diarrhoea and vomiting    If you’ve missed a period or could be pregnant and have any of the symptoms described, contact your doctor immediately.  Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy  Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine you. He or she may also ask you about your medical history.   Your GP will ask you to have a pregnancy test. You have a urine sample tested for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). This hormone is produced throughout pregnancy. If you have the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, a negative pregnancy test doesn’t rule out the possibility but does make it highly unlikely.  If your pregnancy test is positive, or your symptoms strongly suggest you have an ectopic pregnancy, your GP will refer you to a hospital specialist. This may be at a clinic called an early pregnancy assessment unit. If you have severe symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, your GP will call an ambulance to get you straight to hospital as an emergency.  At the clinic or hospital, you’ll have some further tests. Your doctor may ask you to have a blood test to check your progesterone levels. It won’t tell them if your pregnancy is ectopic, but can help them work out if it’s viable – meaning that it’s showing signs of developing into a successful pregnancy – or not. To work out if your pregnancy is ectopic, you may have a blood test for hCG and an ultrasound scan . This uses sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your womb. You may have an abdominal ultrasound or a transvaginal ultrasound, where the sound probe is put inside your vagina.  If the scan shows your womb is empty but your blood test shows high levels of hCG, it's very likely you have an ectopic pregnancy. You may need to have another hCG blood test two days later to help your doctor decide how best to treat you.  If your doctor is still unsure, you may need to have a procedure called a laparoscopy . Your surgeon will use a narrow, tube-like, telescopic camera (called a laparoscope) to look at your fallopian tubes, ovaries and abdomen. They put the laparoscope into your abdomen through a small cut. You usually have a general anaesthetic for a laparoscopy, so you’ll be asleep during the procedure.  Treatment of ectopic pregnancy  An ectopic pregnancy may either get smaller and end by itself, or get bigger and eventually split (rupture) your fallopian tube. This is a medical emergency. Your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are, how advanced your pregnancy is and whether or not your fallopian tube has ruptured.     Watchful waiting (expectant management) You might not need any treatment for an ectopic pregnancy because sometimes the pregnancy ends by itself. Before deciding that this is a safe option for you, your doctor will check that:  the mass in your fallopian tube is smaller than three centimetres and shrinking  you have low levels of pain and there isn’t anything else causing your doctor concern  you’re happy to agree to the necessary monitoring by the hospital    Your doctor will keep a close watch on your progress. They’ll ask you to have regular blood tests. You’ll have tests until hCG is no longer detectable.  Expectant management is successful for between seven and nine out of every 10 women who have it. If it doesn’t work for you, you can go on to have medical treatment or even surgery if necessary.     Medicines  Medical treatment for ectopic pregnancy involves one or more injections into a muscle of a medicine called methotrexate. This stops the growth of the embryo cells and the pregnancy will gradually be absorbed by your body. This treatment is successful in nine out of every 10 women who have it.  To have this treatment, the mass in your fallopian tube must be smaller than four centimetres. After your injection, your doctor will continue to monitor your hCG levels. If they don’t fall far enough within a week, you’ll need to have another dose of methotrexate. Up to one in four women will need a second injection. You’ll have blood tests until hCG is no longer found in your blood. Your doctor may also ask you to have another ultrasound scan.   Treatment with methotrexate does have side-effects. Around three out of every four women treated will have some pain two or three days after their injection. It’s thought this is caused by the pregnancy separating from your body. The injections can also cause sickness or diarrhoea.  It’s important not to get pregnant again within three months of having a methotrexate injection or within six months if you need two injections. If you become pregnant, methotrexate may harm your developing baby, so you’ll need to wait for its effects to wear off.  Some women can’t have treatment with methotrexate. You may not be able to have it if you have:   problems with your immune system  liver disease  lung disease  kidney disease  some types of blood disorder, including anaemia    If you can’t have methotrexate, or if treatment is unsuccessful, your doctor will suggest treatment with surgery.    Surgery You may need surgery to remove your fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy if:   medicines haven’t worked  your pregnancy is larger than three-and-a-half centimetres across  you have severe pain    Usually you’ll have keyhole surgery using a laparoscope for ectopic pregnancy. The laparoscope is a narrow, tube-like telescopic camera that is put into your body through a small cut.  If the fallopian tube that is unaffected by the ectopic pregnancy is healthy, your surgeon will most likely remove the affected tube and ectopic pregnancy. This is known as salpingectomy . If the fallopian tube unaffected by the ectopic pregnancy isn’t healthy,  your surgeon may try to preserve the affected tube and remove the pregnancy through the laparoscope. They’ll do this by cutting open the affected tube (known as salpingotomy) or sucking (aspirating) it out. By doing this, your surgeon attempts to increase your chance of being able to have children in the future.  If you have a salpingotomy, you’ll need to have follow-up tests to check your hCG levels. There’s a chance you’ll need to have the fallopian tube removed in future, or have further treatment with methotrexate. See our medicines section above for more information.  If your fallopian tube ruptures, you may need to have emergency surgery to stop the internal bleeding. You may also need fluids and a blood transfusion if the internal bleeding is severe.  If you have an ectopic pregnancy, your surgeon may do a laparotomy. During a laparotomy your surgeon does the operation through one large cut in your abdomen. In general, your surgeon will try to do keyhole surgery as the procedure and recovery times are shorter. However, they may need to convert the procedure to a laparotomy.  Causes of ectopic pregnancy  The cause is unknown for more than half of women who have an ectopic pregnancy. But there are some factors that can make it more likely that you’ll have one.  An ectopic pregnancy can develop if your fallopian tubes are damaged. The most common cause of this is a past infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease . If your fallopian tubes have been damaged, they may become inflamed, narrowed or scarred. This makes it harder for the fertilised egg to pass down them to your womb.   Other things that make an ectopic pregnancy more likely include:   having a previous ectopic pregnancy  a history of infertility (whether or not this was treated)  getting pregnant when using certain types of contraception – see our FAQ: Contraception and ectopic pregnancy for further information  smoking – may damage the tiny hair cells that normally help the fertilised egg move along the fallopian tube  being over 35  having had a sterilisation operation – if the surgery fails and you get pregnant, it’s possible this may be an ectopic pregnancy    It isn’t possible to prevent an ectopic pregnancy but you can reduce your risk. These include quitting smoking and taking measures to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) , which can damage your fallopian tubes.  Help and support  It’s important to recognise that an ectopic pregnancy can affect you emotionally as well as physically. You may feel sadness and a sense of loss after having an ectopic pregnancy. If you can, try to talk to someone about these feelings. Ask your doctor for information about support that’s available to you.  FAQ: Can an ectopic pregnancy develop normally?  No, ectopic pregnancies aren’t able to develop properly. It isn’t possible for a pregnancy to survive if it implants outside your womb. Only your womb provides the right environment for a baby to grow and receive all the nutrition it needs.  Because an ectopic pregnancy can’t survive, the most important thing to consider when deciding on treatment is your health.  FAQ: Can certain types of contraception increase my risk of ectopic pregnancy?  It’s very unlikely that you’ll become pregnant if you’re using contraception correctly. But if you do, there’s a risk with some types of contraception that your pregnancy is more likely to be ectopic. This risk is associated with the intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine system (IUS) and the progestogen-only pill (POP). Desogestrel – a type of POP – isn’t associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.   Of those women using the IUS and IUD who do become pregnant, four in every 100 have an ectopic pregnancy. Of those using the POP, 10 in every 100 pregnancies are ectopic. Overall, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy isn’t actually increased by using these contraceptives. This is because the overall risk of becoming pregnant goes down.  If you think you might be pregnant, go and see your GP as soon as possible. If you do have an ectopic pregnancy, it is easier to treat and the risk of complications is lower if it is diagnosed early on.  FAQ: Can I get pregnant again after an ectopic pregnancy?  For most women who have had an ectopic pregnancy, the chance of having a normal pregnancy afterwards is good. Even if you had your fallopian tube removed to treat the ectopic pregnancy, your chance of conceiving may only be slightly reduced. Two out of three women who have had a tube removed are able to conceive normally.  However, you may be more likely to have another ectopic pregnancy. Between one in five and one in 10 women will have another ectopic pregnancy. The risk rises to one in three women after two or more ectopic pregnancies. This is because if you have had an ectopic pregnancy, one of your fallopian tubes is likely to have been damaged or even removed. However, this will depend on the type of treatment you had.  If you get pregnant again, it’s important to see your GP as soon as you find out. You’ll need to have an ultrasound scan six to seven weeks into your pregnancy to check the embryo is developing in your womb. An ultrasound uses sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your body.  FAQ: Can untreated ectopic pregnancy lead to cancer?  There’s no link between untreated ectopic pregnancy and cancer. The biggest risk of an untreated ectopic pregnancy that continues to grow is that your fallopian tube could rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding. If you think you may have an ectopic pregnancy, you should contact a doctor.  There’s a very rare type of cancer that can start from cells of any type of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy. It is called choriocarcinoma and is very treatable. Nearly all women are cured. This type of cancer only happens in about one in 50,000 pregnancies, so the chance of getting it after an ectopic pregnancy is extremely low.

Perkins also has extensive experience working in home health with medically fragile pediatric patients.            A woman is holding a home pregnancy test.  Photo Credit: banarfilardhi/iStock/Getty Images          It's possible to have what appears to be a period, even if you're pregnant. It's also possible to have a negative home pregnancy test and still be pregnant. If you think you might be pregnant, even though you're having vaginal bleeding and you have a negative pregnancy test, talk to your medical provider. While you might be experiencing implantation spotting or be testing too early, you might also have a pregnancy complication such as an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. If you have a lot of bleeding or notice other symptoms like dizziness or severe abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention.   Video of the Day             Implantation Bleeding  As many as 25 percent of women have some bleeding in early pregnancy, according to an article published in June of 2009 in "American Family Physician." Some women experience bleeding -- often called implantation bleeding -- around the time of their first missed period, even though they're pregnant. Implantation bleeding occurs when the embryo burrows into the uterine lining. This may seem like a period, but the bleeding is generally less and lasts for a shorter time than your normal period. If you do a home pregnancy test at this time, it might read as negative even though you're pregnant.            Testing Too Early  Home pregnancy tests measure the level of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine. Usually, hCG levels rise rapidly in the first 2 months of pregnancy. Tests vary widely in their ability to detect an early pregnancy. While hCG levels greater than 6.3 mIU/mL can indicate that you're pregnant as early as the time of your first missed period, many tests don't read as positive until urine hCG levels increase to 25 to 100 mIU/mL or higher. Despite claims of accuracy on the packaging, over-the-counter tests can often fail to detect hCG early in pregnancy.  Bleeding in Early Pregnancy  At least 15 percent of pregnancies end in a miscarriage, according to an article published in July of 2011 in "American Family Physician." If you had a positive pregnancy test but now have a negative test and vaginal bleeding, you may be having an early miscarriage. Talk to your doctor if you suspect a miscarriage. Often no specific treatment is needed, but if you are experiencing a large amount of bleeding or feel dizzy or faint, obtain immediate medical care.  Ectopic Pregnancy  As many as 2 percent of pregnancies implant outside the uterus, usually in one of the fallopian tubes. This is called an "ectopic" pregnancy. In an ectopic pregnancy, your hCG levels might not rise as quickly as they would in a pregnancy that implants in the uterus. In this case, you might have a negative home pregnancy test because the hCG levels are too low to detect. Bleeding will also occur as the ectopic pregnancy progresses and the embryo grows too large for the fallopian tube. Eventually, the tube can rupture, producing severe abdominal pain and other symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, or vomiting. Seek immediate medical attention if you think you may have an ectopic pregnancy.                       Lose Weight. Feel Great!

Tho I'm sure I'm closer to 23 weeks by now, I'm much thinner this pregnancy, I'm carrying this baby down low and feeling kicks way inside...more like dull thuds...not like my first who was all out front!

There are pages of women posting they have the same issue - late period and pregnancy symptoms but negative hpt - but NO ONE has come back to say if they are actually pregnant or not. NONE of these posts have been helpful. The question is has ANYONE had negative hpt and ACTUALLY found out they ARE pregnant? Not a friends cousin, but someone here?           a BabyCenter member   Answered 1/4/11               198 found this helpful     My sister took 4 negative HPT went to the doctor got negative results they told her to come back in two weeks when she came back they gave her positive results and she was 10 weeks along then which meant she was gettin negative hpt results up until 10 weeks so its possible the your levels may still be too low                 renee77082    Answered 12/6/07               164 found this helpful     Yes! You can get a negative hcg test and still be pregnant at 5 weeks.. From my expierience, I had about 10 false pregnancy tests and even a false blood test.. On January 17 I had a 
Negative BLOOD TEST.. January 25 and 28 negative hcg test..and finally on feb 4th positive hcg and BLOOD TEST ... And my fist sonogram on feb 15 revealed I'm 7 weeks pregnant :) .. Hope I was helpful to y'all . God bless !                 alize5189    Answered 2/17/13               161 found this helpful     I have been reading this post over and over the last few weeks trying to figure out wether I could be one of these women who didn&#39;t produce much hcg or I was just driving myself crazy with imaginary pregnancy symptoms.
I done 100s of hpt and had 3 blood tests and an ultrasound.
I was driving myself crazy and wasting a lot of money on hpts and doctors visits. I&#39;m not a gambler but these past weeks I&#39;ve felt like a secret pokies addict guiltily sneaking off to pee on a stick thinking maybe this time I&#39;ll get my two little lines. 
I have much empathy for all the women out there like myself who have a secret hpt addiction it is very real and causes a lot of distress every time the test is bfn.
I am a Christian and finally I decided to pray about my predicament instead of driving my doctor mad and driving to pharmacies all over auckland to buy hpts.
Anyway I got my answer and stopped doing the tests having faith that I had heard right, 6weeks into pregnancy it has finally been confirmed.

I have been a 28 day cycle for almost 20 years and now I'm 7 days late! Took 3 tests, one with AM urine, and all were negative. My breasts are sore, hard tummy, mild nausea but worse after I eat, back ache, crampy, but not like PMS cramps at all much higher than those. I've NEVER been late with my period, EVER! I'd only be about 5 weeks along, but mom who works at an OB/GYN office and he co-workers all say I'm pregnant, but that the Hcg levels are not high enough to register yet. Am going to painstakingly wait the week out to see what happens and then go for a blood test. I'm so glad I'm not alone with this waiting game! Oh, and I didn't find out I was pregnant with my first and only child until I was 10 weeks along. Good luck to everyone waiting with me!                 Number4?!?    Answered 4/19/08               104 found this helpful     hello ladies, i too am in the same boat as everyone else. if pregnant i am 5wks and 6days preggo. just took a hpt test and the results were neg. but i know that i have to be preggo. i have never missed a period in 10yrs. today i am 10 days late and feeling very preggo. i have a hard bloated tummy, increased appetite, cramps, gas(mostly belching), head aches, backaches, light headed, and a little nausea with no vomitting. but very nervous because i want this baby soo bad. but also relieved there are soo many women like me going through the same thing.                 ms. nana    Answered 1/30/08               88 found this helpful     I've had three negative tests, one being a blood test, in the last two or three months. Now, I am starting to look pregnant (along with all the symptoms)...I will be having an ultrasound in two weeks. So if I am pregnant, i will know for sure at week 18. My Mother In Law's third one was testing negative at four months as well.                 Mrs_R_Wilkins    Answered 1/16/08               72 found this helpful     I've had two kids, and I think the longest I had to wait was about 6 1/2 weeks-7 weeks. Lonnnngest wait! However, it was cuz the HcG levels were too low to be detected...not cuz I wasn't pregnant. I'm in the waiting process now, myself at just over 5 weeks. HPT tests show the FAINTEST positive lines--which I'm not 100% sure is actually a positive...but I'm having all the pregnancy signs--including morning sickness. So, not knowing this time is REALLY frustrating. Hopefully, you'll get the results you want REALLY soon. I know the wait is a bear!                 smiliemama2009    Answered 12/30/07               60 found this helpful           / 96                 Reason for reporting   Offensive or inappropriate materials  Spamming or advertising  Vulgarity or profanity  Personal attack  Invasion of privacy  Copyright infringement       Cancel    Submit       Thank you for your feedback.

The BabyCenter Editorial Team     The accuracy of a home pregnancy test depends on how and when you take the test, so it's possible that your negative pregnancy test result is not be accurate. What's a false negative pregnancy test result? A "false negative" pregnancy test result shows that you're not pregnant when you are. Why do false negative pregnancy test results happen? The test was taken too soon. If you take a home pregnancy test very soon after you think you may have conceived , or if you didn't follow the test instructions correctly, you might get a false negative test result. A home pregnancy test will be positive only if it detects the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). When an egg is fertilized after you ovulate , it takes about a week to travel through a fallopian tube to the uterus. And your body starts producing hCG only after a fertilized egg implants in the uterus . If it's very early in your pregnancy, your body might not have produced enough hCG yet. In that case, you'd get a negative result at first. Also, some tests are more sensitive than others, and no test is 100 percent accurate. And a few women have such low levels of hCG during pregnancy that home tests can't measure it. Although some tests can detect hCG the first day you miss your period, you'll have a better chance of getting an accurate result if you wait a week. Don't time the test based on when you think you might have conceived. Sperm can live in the fallopian tubes for up to five days, so it's possible you conceived several days after having sex. Hormones were low. For the most accurate result, follow the test instructions exactly, and take the test when you first get up in the morning. That's the time when your urine – and any hCG – is the most concentrated. What if the test is taken correctly and I get a negative result? If you're sure you've waited long enough to test and you're still getting a negative result , you're probably not pregnant. Pregnancy isn't the only reason for a missed period – stress, too much exercise, and thyroid problems, among other things, can all delay menstruation. If your period is weeks late without a positive test result, talk to your doctor to figure out whether you're pregnant or need help getting your menstrual cycle on track.

However, most medications, including antibiotics and birth control pills, don't affect the accuracy of home pregnancy tests.   Could a positive result be wrong?    Although rare, it's possible to get a positive result from a home pregnancy test when you're not actually pregnant. This is known as a false-positive.  A false-positive might happen if you had a pregnancy loss soon after the fertilized egg attached to your uterine lining (biochemical pregnancy) or you take a pregnancy test too soon after taking a fertility drug that contains HCG. An ectopic pregnancy, menopause or problems with your ovaries also might contribute to misleading test results.   Could a negative result be wrong?    It's possible to get a negative result from a home pregnancy test when you're actually pregnant. This is known as a false-negative — and it's much more likely to occur than is a false-positive. You might get a false-negative if you:   Take the test too early. The earlier after a missed period that you take a home pregnancy test, the harder it is for the test to detect HCG. For the most accurate results, take the test one week after a missed period — when the level of HCG in your urine is most likely to be detectable. If you can't wait that long, ask your health care provider for a blood test.  Check test results too soon. Be sure to give the test time to work. Consider setting a timer according to the package instructions.  Use diluted urine. For the most accurate results, take the test first thing in the morning — when your urine is the most concentrated.   What happens next?    Based on your test results, consider taking the following steps:   Your home pregnancy test is positive, or you've taken a few home pregnancy tests and gotten mixed results. Make an appointment with your health care provider. You might need a blood test or ultrasound to confirm your pregnancy. The sooner your pregnancy is confirmed, the sooner you can begin prenatal care.  Your home pregnancy test is negative. If your period doesn't begin, repeat the test in a few days or one week — especially if you took the test before or shortly after a missed period.  You continue to get negative test results, but your period doesn't begin or you still think you might be pregnant. Check with your health care provider. Many factors can lead to missed menstrual periods (amenorrhea), including thyroid disorders, low body weight, problems with your ovaries, excessive exercise and stress. If you're not pregnant, your health care provider can help you get your menstrual cycle back on track.    Previous  Share Tweet  Dec. 02, 2015  References   Bastian LA, et al.

Some women are actively trying to achieve a pregnancy so that they can begin a family. Others are active in trying to prevent a pregnancy because they are not ready to start a family. When there is a question about whether a pregnancy has happened, a pregnancy test is a fast and affordable way of being able to determine if you may be pregnant and need to visit a doctor.  Statistics About Pregnancy Test False Negatives  1. 46% of women were with their partner when they found out about the results of the first pregnancy test.  2. 62% of women in a recent survey didn’t trust the positive result from their home pregnancy test and took at least one more test just to make sure.  3. The percentage of women who head to the doctor’s office to get a confirmation test from a positive pregnancy test result: 52%.  4. Home pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone called hCG that a woman’s body starts releasing once a fertilized egg has implanted in the uterus.  5. Up to 60% of women who think they may be pregnant take the pregnancy test up to 1 week to soon and this can create a negative result.  6. 34% of women who became mothers and used a pregnancy test used at least two of them as a method to confirm the results in the same cycle they conceived and received different results.  7. 65.1% of pregnancy tests reported by women who took one 8 days past ovulation reported having a negative result.  8. The percentage of negative pregnancy test results from women who were pregnant at 21 days past ovulation: 8.3%.  9. It usually takes 10 days after conception for a fertilized egg to be implanted into the uterus.  10. Each woman ovulates at a different time in her menstrual cycle, accounting for some of the statistics of false negative pregnancy tests.  11. Problems with a pregnancy can affect the amount of hCG in the urine and account for false negative readings as well.  12. In up to 10% of women, implantation does not occur until after the first day of a missed period. This means some women get accurate results just 1 day after a missed period.  13. At any given time in the United States, up to 7% of the female population may be pregnant.  14. Assuming that the 99% accuracy claims of a pregnancy test are true, a woman has a 9% chance of not being pregnant with a positive result.  15. The odds of a woman being pregnant and receiving a false negative would be less than 5%.  16. Home pregnancy tests have been found to be 97% accurate when they are used according to their instructions and the results are read at the appropriate time.  17. 25% of women do not achieve a positive pregnancy test result from a urine test until after they miss their first period.   Common Results Among Pregnant Women  Or is it? Even for women who are pregnant, it is common to have a negative result first from a pregnancy test. This first negative, which is called a false negative, can create joy or disappointment depending on each woman’s perspective. The only problem is that these tests are not 100% reliable, especially in the earliest days of a pregnancy.  That’s why the results of a pregnancy test need to be taken like a grain of salt. It is information that can be used, but it is also information that should be verified. If you are concerned about a pregnancy, then a visit to the family doctor is enough to confirm the results of a pregnancy test or determine that they are false. Many women are actually choosing to go to the doctor first when they think they are pregnant because of the history of false negatives that are associated with the modern retail pregnancy test.  As statistics will show, even though women still purchase pregnancy tests every day, a majority of them do not put their full confidence into the results that are displayed.      Understanding False Negatives  The good news is that a majority of false negative tests can be attributed to user error. By following the instructions on the packaging, most women are going to be able to get the accurate information that they need to determine what their next choices should be regarding a pregnancy.  If you have recently had a negative result on a pregnancy test, the best recommendation is to wait a few days and then try the test again. A negative result may mean that you are not pregnant. It may also mean that you decided to take the test earlier than recommended or that you may have taken the test incorrectly. If you have received different answers from different pregnancy tests on the same cycle, then the best solution is to visit the family doctor to get an accurate blood test done to confirm at least one of the results.  Even blood tests provide a false negative, however, if they are taken too early. This is why it is important to wait until about 10 days after a missed cycle before taking any testing. Some women may be able to determine a pregnancy just 1 day after their missed cycle, but there’s a 90% chance that the average woman isn’t going to fit into that group. That can be a long time to wait, whether a woman wants the pregnancy or not, but it is better to have accurate information at the end of the process than base beliefs off of inaccurate information instead.  For most women, two weeks is the longest they will need to wait in order to get the most accurate pregnancy test. This is because menstruation happens about 14 days after ovulation. False negatives occur because an ovulation period is later than it is supposed to be. Having a follow-up test on a negative result at 21 days shows statistically that most pregnancies can be determined at home. By being patient, the right results will typically shine through.

Can a Pregnancy Test Give a False Negative?  You took an at-home pregnancy test , and it said you're not pregnant . But what are the chances you got a false negative pregnancy test result? By Elena Donovan Mauer  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         michaeljung/Shutterstock.com  You've probably heard "I didn't know I was pregnant" stories that went something like this: A woman claims she took an at-home pregnancy test that came back negative, but, lo and behold, she really was pregnant -- and the pregnancy progressed without her knowledge. It's a scary thought, but you shouldn't worry about it happening to you. False negative pregnancy tests don't really happen, as long as you're taking the test correctly. But there are some reasons why you could get a negative reading when you're actually pregnant -- so this is what to avoid: Taking the test too early Even if you're champing at the bit to know whether or not you're expecting, wait until you've missed your period to take the test. "Home pregnancy tests are a qualitative test and measure whether or not hCG -- the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin -- is present in your urine," explains Stephen Rechner, M.D., the Division Chief of General Obstetrics and Gynecology at Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids. "A detectable amount of this hormone is typically not seen until after the first missed period." Wondering if you're pregnant? Take our quiz! After your period was due, the accuracy of your home pregnancy test is 97 percent, says Sean Daneshmand, M.D., an ob-gyn based in San Diego and the founder of the nonprofit organization Miracle Babies. The remaining 3 percent may simply need a little more time. Because women's menstrual cycles can vary, those women may not have enough hCG for the test to pick up yet. "If you receive a negative pregnancy test, you should wait a few days and try it again," says Dr. Rechner. HCG levels in your blood increase rapidly if you really are pregnant -- they should double approximately every 48 hours -- so you should be able to trust the negative test result if you took the test about a week after you missed your period. Most women find out they're pregnant about four to six weeks after the first day of their last period, says Dr. Daneshmand. How Accurate are Pregnancy Tests? Using an expired pregnancy test Be selective when you buy your pregnancy test. Check the box to make sure it hasn't passed its expiration date, in which case it probably won't work properly, says Dr. Daneshmand. Taking the test incorrectly Follow the instructions that come with your pregnancy test carefully to be sure you're taking it the right way. Dr. Rechner advises taking the test first thing in the morning, as the concentration of hCG in your urine is usually highest then.

Merely Me   , Community Member   Reviewed by: Peter J. Chen, MD, FACOG          Credit: iStock   One of the most frequent questions we get here on Sexual Health Connection is from women wanting to know if they are pregnant. I addressed this issue in my article " Am I Pregnant? How to Know." A variation of this theme are women who have taken a home pregnancy test or even several of them and they turn out negative. The question we then get is: “Can I still be pregnant even though my home pregnancy test is negative?”      So for this article, I researched the reasons why these tests can sometimes yield an inaccurate result and how you can up the odds for having more accurate test results.  How do home pregnancy tests work?  The National Women’s Health Information Center tells us that all types of pregnancy tests attempt to detect a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG. This “pregnancy hormone” is made when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. It varies from woman to woman how long this implantation can take. For most women this happens about six days after the egg is fertilized by the sperm but for some women implantation can occur as late as the first day of the missed period. Each day after implantation, the amount of hCG in your system will increase rapidly.  There are two different types of pregnancy tests. One type of pregnancy test is a blood test given by your doctor. A blood test combined with a pelvic exam can be considered the most reliable way to see if you are pregnant. The second type of pregnancy test uses a urine sample and this can be performed at the doctor’s office or at home using a home pregnancy test. If you use a home pregnancy test, most commonly you will be instructed to hold a stick in your urine stream where an absorbent strip will collect the urine for testing. Directions are given with each test kit to determine if you are pregnant such as seeing a plus or minus sign and now there are some tests which even show the word “pregnant” in the test results window of the test stick. So it is now easier than ever to test for pregnancy in the privacy and convenience of your own home.      But are home pregnancy tests always accurate? It seems the answer depends mostly upon how you use the test.  What types of errors occur with using a home urine pregnancy test?  There are two ways that a home urine pregnancy test can be inaccurate. One type of error is to have a false positive reading. This means that although your pregnancy test indicates that you are positive for pregnancy, you are not really pregnant. The other error which can occur is that you get a false negative result. This means that although your test says that you are not pregnant, you really are pregnant.  Most times when there is an error with home pregnancy tests it is caused by not following the directions given with the test. Bastian et al (1998) found that most false negative results are due to users not using the kits properly. If used correctly most home pregnancy tests have a high degree of reliability although some brands may be more accurate than others.  Does the brand of home urine pregnancy test make a difference in reliability and accuracy?      Indeed the brand of test you use can impact upon the accuracy of results. A Wellsphere article entitled, “Sensitivity Chart Home Pregnancy Tests” provides us with an easy to read chart comparing the Sensitivity (or the hCG threshold at which a positive result is indicated). One brand of home pregnancy test which shows a high level of sensitivity for detecting hCG and has been cited in the literature consistently as being the most reliable and accurate test is the First Response Early Result Pregnancy Test. In 2003 Consumer Reports senior editor Nancy Metcalf talked about the best pregnancy tests on CBS’s The Morning Show . Consumer Reports had tested 18 brands of home pregnancy tests and the First Response Early Result Pregnancy Test was found to be the most reliable and sensitive test kit, detecting hCG at concentrations as low as 6.5 mIU/ml. Metcalf reported that this test was super sensitive enough to detect any pregnancy soon after implantation.      Possible reasons for a false negative if you ARE pregnant    It is estimated that in 10 percent of pregnant women, the embryo does not implant until after the first day of the missed period and as late as a week after a missed period, three percent of pregnancies still hadn’t implanted. So if you take the test too early your hCG levels might not be detected due to implantation occurring later than usual. (source: “The Best Pregnancy Tests” by Tatiana Morales)    The urine is too dilute.    The pregnancy is developing abnormally and a miscarriage is happening.    Miscalculation of when your period was actually due leading to taking the test too early to detect hCG levels.    Possible reasons for a false positive test result if your test is positive but you’re NOT pregnant:        Some medications and drugs which reportedly can cause you to have a false positive home pregnancy test result. These drugs include: Methadone, methyldopa (used to treat hypertension), diuretics and promethazine (used to treat allergy symptoms and nausea). Some tranquilizers and antidepressants are reported to be able to cause a false positive result, as well as large doses of aspirin.    You are taking a fertility drug which contains hCG.    Some medical conditions such as rare cancers, trophoblastic disease, ovarian cysts, and thyroid disorders can sometimes create false-positive results.    The egg never implants properly or else spontaneously aborts soon after implantation. It is estimated that up to a third of all conceptions implant and then fail. If you take the test too early you may be in for disappointment when your period comes despite a positive test result. Because only positive hCG is detected and a clinical pregnancy never developed, doctors sometimes call this clinical scenario “chemical pregnancy.”        You let the test sit too long before reading the result. If you read the test results after the instructed time period, a faint positive may appear which will be inaccurate if read at that time.    Ways to get the most accurate test results from a home pregnancy test    The literature is consistent with advice to take a home pregnancy test a week after your missed period. This will give most eggs a chance to implant and also your hCG levels will be more detectable.    Use your first morning urine as it will be more concentrated and hCG will be more easily detected.    Use a reliable and sensitive brand of home pregnancy test.    Make sure to follow the directions given with the home pregnancy kit. Always read the results in the time frame indicated or they may be inaccurate.    Make sure that you are not using an expired test. Check the expiration date on the box.        Buy at least two tests. If you are doubtful or unsure of the first test results, take another test in a week.    If you have taken two or more pregnancy tests and you still have concerns, schedule an appointment with your doctor or gynecologist. They will be able to give you a blood test for pregnancy as well as conduct a pelvic exam to see what is going on. For peace of mind see your doctor.    I hope this post was helpful to anyone who is wondering whether or not they may be pregnant. It can be an especially anxious time. Home pregnancy tests are mostly reliable but some things can affect the accuracy of your results. The best advice I can give is to be patient. It can be difficult to wait but if you want to be more certain of your test results, wait at least a week after your period to take a test. And then check with your doctor if there is any confusion.

She is a mother to 3 children from 4-25 years old. Contact Author   Reasons for a negative pregnancy test result       Do you feel sure that you're pregnant but ended up with one or more negative pregnancy test results and still no period? You're not alone—getting a negative test with a missed period is more common than you might think. While home pregnancy tests have improved over the years and are an extremely accurate predictor of pregnancy, there have still been many instances of a test giving a false negative result.   How Home Pregnancy Tests Work At-home pregnancy tests work by testing a small sample of urine for hCG—human chorionic gonadotrophin. hCG is the pregnancy hormone that is produced by the developing embryo and, later, by part of the placenta.  Measuring the hCG via home pregnancy tests is qualitative, which explains why the results are a plain ‘yes’/‘no’ or ‘negative’/‘positive’.   Most Common Reasons for a Late Period and Negative Pregnancy Test Dr. Stuart Spitalnic from Brown University asserts that "taking the test too early and not being pregnant are the main reasons for a negative test." If you take the test too early, then your hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) hormone levels are too low for the test to detect. Missing your period means that you ovulated later than usual. Wait two weeks after your period is missed , and  take the test again for an accurate result.  "A very dilute urine (over-hydrating to "study" for the test) is another cause," says Dr. Spitalnic. Don't drink too much water before taking the test. For best results, test the first pee in the morning.   Reasons for a negative pregnancy test and no period.       What Causes a Late Period or No Period and a Negative Pregnancy Test? 1. You Are Pregnant, but You Took the Test Too Early  Pregnancy tests work by detecting the pregnancy hormone hCG. If you are pretty sure you are pregnant because you've been experiencing some early pregnancy symptoms but have a negative test result, one of the most common reasons is that you have taken the pregnancy test too early, and your body has not produced enough hCG hormone for the test to detect it. hCG can be detected in the urine only at a minimum of two weeks after conception occurs. For a 99% accurate test result, the test needs to detect at least 25 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). In the first two weeks of pregnancy, only about 10 mlU/ml of hCG is present.  So, to get a reliable test result, wait two weeks after your period is missed . By this time, your body will be creating plenty of hCG, and your home pregnancy test will be far more accurate.  2. You Are Pregnant, but the Test Is Faulty  The test may have expired, or it may have been stored improperly (e.g. in a wet bathroom cabinet). Buy a new test, and try again to make sure the results are accurate.  3. You Are Pregnant, but You Have Irregular Periods and Late Ovulation  If you have irregular menstrual cycles, then having a negative test but no period might mean that your ovulation was simply late this month. This will ultimately delay the implantation date, which might have caused you to miscount the number of days when you can finally take the test. This is why it's advisable to test a week or two after the day you were expecting your period. If you conceived late in the month, your hCG levels could very well be lower than the pregnancy test can detect, therefore resulting in a false negative.  Your menstrual cycle can be divided into two phases: the follicular phase, which begins on the first day of your period and ends when you ovulate, and the luteal phase, which begins after ovulation and ends when your next period starts. The luteal phase usually lasts 11-13 days and doesn't vary much, but the follicular phase could be affected by physical or mental changes, such as exercise, stress, diet, etc.  A negative test and no period could just mean that your period is late because your ovulation started later. Women with irregular periods have a longer window for ovulation, and thus, are particularly prone to miscounting and even having skipped periods. If you keep getting a negative test but still have no period, then you should consult with your doctor. Major changes in your cycle can be symptoms of other conditions, including but not limited to pregnancy.  4. You Are Pregnant, but You Are Too Far Along in Your Pregnancy  Dr. Ann Gronowski, professor of pathology and immunology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis calls this the "variant hook effect." She explains that part of the problem is that "hCG comes in many different isoforms, and after five weeks of pregnancy, you get much more of one variant form (called the beta core fragment) than you get of the hCG intact molecule." In other words, at-home pregnancy tests are intended to detect early molecular forms of hCG. After five weeks of pregnancy, the hCG's molecular structure changes and that structure is unable to be detected as effectively, sometimes resulting in a false negative. This is when a serum test (done through blood work) would be your best option for accuracy.  5. You Are Pregnant With Twins or Triplets  Carrying two or more babies causes a woman to produce very high levels of hCG and at-home pregnancy tests may not be able to detect it because there's actually too much. This is known as the "high-dose hook effect."  Dr. Gronowski explains that hCG tests work by forming a "sandwich" with two antibodies as the "bread" and the hCG molecule as the "meat." When the hCG concentration is too high, it saturates both antibodies, and there are so many molecules that the antibodies can't form a sandwich, resulting in a negative pregnancy result. Some women report positive results after diluting their urine with water, however, a blood test at the doctor's office is a better option for accuracy.  6. You Have an Ectopic Pregnancy That Delays the Production of hGC  An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants itself somewhere other than the uterus (usually in the fallopian tube), which delays the production of hCG hormones and causes severe pain in the lower abdomen or to one side. This condition is rare and occurs in only 1 out of 40 pregnancies, but it is very dangerous and must be diagnosed early to prevent life-threatening consequences for the woman.  7. You Are Pregnant, but You Have Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD)  This is extremely rare. Gestational trophoblastic disease occurs when tumors form in the layer of cells called the  trophoblast  that normally surrounds an embryo. The most common form of GTD is called the hydatidiform mole, also known as a molar pregnancy. These tumors are rarely cancerous, but the pregnancy usually ends in miscarriage because the embryo cannot form. Very rarely can a healthy baby emerge from a GTD pregnancy.  8. You Are Not Pregnant, and Your Period Is Late for Other Reasons  There are several other medical conditions that can result in a negative pregnancy test and no period, which is why it's always wise to see your doctor if this occurs. Some conditions that may cause your periods to stop unexpectedly are ovarian cysts, hyperthyroidism, polycystic ovarian disease, high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), menopause, anorexia, secondary amenorrhea, obesity and adrenal cancer.  Changes in your diet can also result in changes to your menstrual cycle. The ketogenic diet or any diet that puts your body into a ketogenic state on a long term basis can affect your cycle. One study in teenagers who ate a ketogenic diet to control a particular type of epilepsy found that 45% of subjects reported menstrual changes as a side effect.  9. You Didn't Follow Instructions Correctly  Read the instructions on your home pregnancy test’s package carefully so that you can administer the test properly—the test is only as good as your ability to follow the instructions! Since the tests are qualitative, this makes them sensitive to the process of testing. Most home pregnancy tests ask you to hold a test strip in urine, and pee on it while on the toilet. Some make you dip the test strip in a clean cup where you have collected the urine (my preferred method for an accurate pregnancy test result).       How to Get an Accurate Pregnancy Test Result • Get the first urine in the morning. The first pee of the day is the best urine to use to ensure accuracy because it's so much more concentrated from having collected in the bladder overnight. • Drinking too much water can dilute the urine, which may result in a false negative. • Results may also be affected by medications you are taking. They can mask the presence of hCG or affect their sensitivity. If in doubt, consult your pharmacist or doctor. • Visit a doctor for an ultrasound.   HCG Levels Aren't the Same for Everyone A slow rate of hCG production is another good explanation for a negative test and no period. Not everybody is built the same—levels of hCG produced vary from woman to woman. If you tested too early or your body is not making enough hCG for the test to pick up, then you'll get a false negative.  As previously stated, home pregnancy tests are usually very accurate. However, there are, of course, times when they are less so, and this is one instance where that could happen. While these tests have become better over the years, it’s always best to get your test result confirmed. The confirmatory tests are usually diagnostic procedures done by your doctor. This may involve a verification of the gestational sac and fetal parts using ultrasound, the detection of a fetal heartbeat, and the detection of fetal movements by a trained examiner.   Don't Rely Solely on the Test; Look for Symptoms Remember, don’t just rely on home pregnancy testing because stressing over a negative test with no period isn’t worth it, especially when there is the possibility of having another life to take care of.  Read up on what a woman experiences during early pregnancy and the symptoms you can expect to experience. Listen to your body as well. If you firmly suspect that you are pregnant or your period still hasn't arrived after a few weeks, set an appointment with your doctor without delay to find out for sure.

She can examine you and tell you if you're pregnant and if you're not, then look into other causes for your periods to stop.  Author Susana S 5 weeks ago  Please read above about the variant hook effect and the limitations of pee on the stick type pregnancy tests. Hope everything goes well in your pregnancy.  Author Susana S 5 weeks ago  Wait a week and take it again. Either your period will arrive late or you'll be producing enough hcg for a test to pick up.  Author Susana S 5 weeks ago  A standard pregnancy test probably wouldn't work now if you're 5 months pregnant. See the explanation above about the variant hook effect. Wishing you well :)  Zoe 6 weeks ago  I havent had a period in 4 months yet all pregnancy test i have taken keep showing up negative, what should i do?

So I'm now three weeks late. Last period was November 22nd, December she was a no show. I did (without realizing I was ovulating) have a... good amount of unprotected sex. I'm twenty four, and have been having extremely* regular periods for the past ten years. I've been way more stressed out than i was when i initally missed my period and I have NEVER missed a period. I've now taken four home pregnancy tests that all came back negative. I went to the doctor on January second and talked to her. She took a blood which came back negative for pregnancy stds and anemia. I also had her check me for pneumonia, and thyroid issues. All of which are normal and not the problem. I'm feeling nauseous without any actual vomiting, unable to control my body temp, very tired, sensitive to smells and just overall strange. In the past few days my boobs have gotten sore, nipples are so tender. Peeing all the time, cant poop. I did have some mild cramping and very light pink/brownish spotting shortly after I think I would * have conceived. I'm feeling notable lower back pain. Vivid dreams, uncharacteristic forgetfulness. Dull pain in what is (I had to look up the body part) my round ligament and I swear to God the other night when I got up to pee... a clear jelly fish came out of me... tmi I know sorry, but it was the weirdest thing. Totally clear/ some cloudy white spots and it was almost solid... Like viscous. Odorless but still very strange. I have another appointment on the eleventh for a pelvic exam and I'm hoping that will give me an answer. Is there any chance a pelvic exam could also be inconclusive? If I have to miss another period before I get an answer I might go crazy.

I'm experiencing cramps and breast soreness. I'm just 19 years old. I had my LMP on Nov.24 and we had sex (my bf and I, ofcourse) on Dec.4. Please, help me. I don't know what's happening to me. :(  Dia 3 months ago  I had always 28 days gap between my two periods. But on 15th August, I had 15 days gaps approx. between my two periods. I visit my home country Bangladesh, met with a doctor. She did some ultrasound and said that I have some infections. So I took some antibiotics suggested by doctor. My next period was in 20th September, 25 days gap. Due to taking antibiotics, I lost my appetite extremely and was feeling so sick. So another doctor suggested me tablet Varigestrol 1+0+1 for 14 days. My height is 4 feet 11 inch. My average weight was 42 kg. But after taking the antibiotics, I became 40 kg. Then I came back Japan and started taking tablet varigestrol to improve my appetite. My appetite increased so much, I became 45 kg suddenly. Still now, I am 45 kg. But my next period was 37 days gap. I had so less bleeding. And my bleeding color surprised me a lot. So dark brown, then pink, then red (a white clot was also seen in that time), then dark brown and finished. Then I met with another gynecologist doctor in Japan and did some test. Pregnancy test was negative at that time.  Dr. suggested me tablet LUTORAL (1+0+1) for 7 days. My next period was 34 days late but it took 11 days to finish. First 4/5 days bleeding was so less, but after that normal bleeding started. Then I visited the doctor again to know the test result.I have no abdominal cancer, no thyroid problem etc. But my estrogen was .34. Doctor said that it is not a big problem. Doctor also suggested some medication to use in my vagina, for getting some bacteria in my vagina. And advised to notice that if I miss any period in the next. Today it is 40th day. But I am having no period. My age is 31 years old. I have no plan to take baby now. I am married and I take no pill, just use condom. I want to know, what is the problem going on in my body? Why it became so mysterious for myself.

Sign up now        Could medications interfere with test results?    Fertility drugs or other medications that contain HCG might interfere with home pregnancy test results. However, most medications, including antibiotics and birth control pills, don't affect the accuracy of home pregnancy tests.   Could a positive result be wrong?    Although rare, it's possible to get a positive result from a home pregnancy test when you're not actually pregnant. This is known as a false-positive.  A false-positive might happen if you had a pregnancy loss soon after the fertilized egg attached to your uterine lining (biochemical pregnancy) or you take a pregnancy test too soon after taking a fertility drug that contains HCG. An ectopic pregnancy, menopause or problems with your ovaries also might contribute to misleading test results.   Could a negative result be wrong?    It's possible to get a negative result from a home pregnancy test when you're actually pregnant. This is known as a false-negative — and it's much more likely to occur than is a false-positive. You might get a false-negative if you:   Take the test too early. The earlier after a missed period that you take a home pregnancy test, the harder it is for the test to detect HCG. For the most accurate results, take the test one week after a missed period — when the level of HCG in your urine is most likely to be detectable. If you can't wait that long, ask your health care provider for a blood test.  Check test results too soon. Be sure to give the test time to work. Consider setting a timer according to the package instructions.  Use diluted urine. For the most accurate results, take the test first thing in the morning — when your urine is the most concentrated.   What happens next?    Based on your test results, consider taking the following steps:   Your home pregnancy test is positive, or you've taken a few home pregnancy tests and gotten mixed results. Make an appointment with your health care provider. You might need a blood test or ultrasound to confirm your pregnancy. The sooner your pregnancy is confirmed, the sooner you can begin prenatal care.  Your home pregnancy test is negative. If your period doesn't begin, repeat the test in a few days or one week — especially if you took the test before or shortly after a missed period.  You continue to get negative test results, but your period doesn't begin or you still think you might be pregnant. Check with your health care provider. Many factors can lead to missed menstrual periods (amenorrhea), including thyroid disorders, low body weight, problems with your ovaries, excessive exercise and stress. If you're not pregnant, your health care provider can help you get your menstrual cycle back on track.    Previous  Share Tweet  Dec. 02, 2015  References   Bastian LA, et al.

The BabyCenter Editorial Team     The accuracy of a home pregnancy test depends on how and when you take the test, so it's possible that your negative pregnancy test result is not be accurate. What's a false negative pregnancy test result? A "false negative" pregnancy test result shows that you're not pregnant when you are. Why do false negative pregnancy test results happen? The test was taken too soon. If you take a home pregnancy test very soon after you think you may have conceived , or if you didn't follow the test instructions correctly, you might get a false negative test result. A home pregnancy test will be positive only if it detects the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). When an egg is fertilized after you ovulate , it takes about a week to travel through a fallopian tube to the uterus. And your body starts producing hCG only after a fertilized egg implants in the uterus . If it's very early in your pregnancy, your body might not have produced enough hCG yet. In that case, you'd get a negative result at first. Also, some tests are more sensitive than others, and no test is 100 percent accurate. And a few women have such low levels of hCG during pregnancy that home tests can't measure it. Although some tests can detect hCG the first day you miss your period, you'll have a better chance of getting an accurate result if you wait a week. Don't time the test based on when you think you might have conceived. Sperm can live in the fallopian tubes for up to five days, so it's possible you conceived several days after having sex. Hormones were low. For the most accurate result, follow the test instructions exactly, and take the test when you first get up in the morning. That's the time when your urine – and any hCG – is the most concentrated. What if the test is taken correctly and I get a negative result? If you're sure you've waited long enough to test and you're still getting a negative result , you're probably not pregnant. Pregnancy isn't the only reason for a missed period – stress, too much exercise, and thyroid problems, among other things, can all delay menstruation. If your period is weeks late without a positive test result, talk to your doctor to figure out whether you're pregnant or need help getting your menstrual cycle on track.

This is most often in one of your fallopian tubes. The fertilised egg can’t survive and you may need immediate treatment to prevent any complications.                           About ectopic pregnancy  In a usual, healthy pregnancy, an egg released by your ovary is fertilised by sperm in one of your fallopian tubes. It then travels to your womb where it implants in the lining and grows into a baby.  About one in every 100 pregnancies is ectopic, which means the fertilised egg implants outside your womb (uterus). Most often it implants in one of your fallopian tubes. Other places include:   at the point where your fallopian tube meets your womb  in one of your ovaries  at the neck of your womb (cervix)  in your abdomen (tummy)  in a caesarean scar    Unfortunately, the fertilised egg can’t survive. The pregnancy may end by itself or it could continue to grow. You may need immediate treatment to prevent any complications. If the egg keeps growing, it can split open (rupture) the fallopian tube and cause life-threatening internal bleeding.  Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy  Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy usually appear about six to eight weeks after you last had a period. There are three common symptoms:   not having periods  pelvic or abdominal (tummy) pain – this is usually on one side although it can spread across both  unusual bleeding from your vagina – the blood is often likened to prune juice and may or may not contain clots    However, not all women get these symptoms. Two in every 10 women with ectopic pregnancy don’t have bleeding and one in every 10 women doesn’t have pain.  Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are similar to those of a miscarriage and you and your doctor may not be able to tell the difference at first.  As they grow, ectopic pregnancies can bleed and eventually rupture. This may cause:   pain in the tip of your shoulder – this is caused by bleeding into your abdomen, which irritates nerves that run to your shoulder  feeling dizzy or faint – a ruptured fallopian tube can lead to serious internal bleeding,  causing you to collapse  diarrhoea and vomiting    If you’ve missed a period or could be pregnant and have any of the symptoms described, contact your doctor immediately.  Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy  Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine you. He or she may also ask you about your medical history.   Your GP will ask you to have a pregnancy test. You have a urine sample tested for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). This hormone is produced throughout pregnancy. If you have the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, a negative pregnancy test doesn’t rule out the possibility but does make it highly unlikely.  If your pregnancy test is positive, or your symptoms strongly suggest you have an ectopic pregnancy, your GP will refer you to a hospital specialist. This may be at a clinic called an early pregnancy assessment unit. If you have severe symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, your GP will call an ambulance to get you straight to hospital as an emergency.  At the clinic or hospital, you’ll have some further tests. Your doctor may ask you to have a blood test to check your progesterone levels. It won’t tell them if your pregnancy is ectopic, but can help them work out if it’s viable – meaning that it’s showing signs of developing into a successful pregnancy – or not. To work out if your pregnancy is ectopic, you may have a blood test for hCG and an ultrasound scan . This uses sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your womb. You may have an abdominal ultrasound or a transvaginal ultrasound, where the sound probe is put inside your vagina.  If the scan shows your womb is empty but your blood test shows high levels of hCG, it's very likely you have an ectopic pregnancy. You may need to have another hCG blood test two days later to help your doctor decide how best to treat you.  If your doctor is still unsure, you may need to have a procedure called a laparoscopy . Your surgeon will use a narrow, tube-like, telescopic camera (called a laparoscope) to look at your fallopian tubes, ovaries and abdomen. They put the laparoscope into your abdomen through a small cut. You usually have a general anaesthetic for a laparoscopy, so you’ll be asleep during the procedure.  Treatment of ectopic pregnancy  An ectopic pregnancy may either get smaller and end by itself, or get bigger and eventually split (rupture) your fallopian tube. This is a medical emergency. Your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are, how advanced your pregnancy is and whether or not your fallopian tube has ruptured.     Watchful waiting (expectant management) You might not need any treatment for an ectopic pregnancy because sometimes the pregnancy ends by itself. Before deciding that this is a safe option for you, your doctor will check that:  the mass in your fallopian tube is smaller than three centimetres and shrinking  you have low levels of pain and there isn’t anything else causing your doctor concern  you’re happy to agree to the necessary monitoring by the hospital    Your doctor will keep a close watch on your progress. They’ll ask you to have regular blood tests. You’ll have tests until hCG is no longer detectable.  Expectant management is successful for between seven and nine out of every 10 women who have it. If it doesn’t work for you, you can go on to have medical treatment or even surgery if necessary.     Medicines  Medical treatment for ectopic pregnancy involves one or more injections into a muscle of a medicine called methotrexate. This stops the growth of the embryo cells and the pregnancy will gradually be absorbed by your body. This treatment is successful in nine out of every 10 women who have it.  To have this treatment, the mass in your fallopian tube must be smaller than four centimetres. After your injection, your doctor will continue to monitor your hCG levels. If they don’t fall far enough within a week, you’ll need to have another dose of methotrexate. Up to one in four women will need a second injection. You’ll have blood tests until hCG is no longer found in your blood. Your doctor may also ask you to have another ultrasound scan.   Treatment with methotrexate does have side-effects. Around three out of every four women treated will have some pain two or three days after their injection. It’s thought this is caused by the pregnancy separating from your body. The injections can also cause sickness or diarrhoea.  It’s important not to get pregnant again within three months of having a methotrexate injection or within six months if you need two injections. If you become pregnant, methotrexate may harm your developing baby, so you’ll need to wait for its effects to wear off.  Some women can’t have treatment with methotrexate. You may not be able to have it if you have:   problems with your immune system  liver disease  lung disease  kidney disease  some types of blood disorder, including anaemia    If you can’t have methotrexate, or if treatment is unsuccessful, your doctor will suggest treatment with surgery.    Surgery You may need surgery to remove your fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy if:   medicines haven’t worked  your pregnancy is larger than three-and-a-half centimetres across  you have severe pain    Usually you’ll have keyhole surgery using a laparoscope for ectopic pregnancy. The laparoscope is a narrow, tube-like telescopic camera that is put into your body through a small cut.  If the fallopian tube that is unaffected by the ectopic pregnancy is healthy, your surgeon will most likely remove the affected tube and ectopic pregnancy. This is known as salpingectomy . If the fallopian tube unaffected by the ectopic pregnancy isn’t healthy,  your surgeon may try to preserve the affected tube and remove the pregnancy through the laparoscope. They’ll do this by cutting open the affected tube (known as salpingotomy) or sucking (aspirating) it out. By doing this, your surgeon attempts to increase your chance of being able to have children in the future.  If you have a salpingotomy, you’ll need to have follow-up tests to check your hCG levels. There’s a chance you’ll need to have the fallopian tube removed in future, or have further treatment with methotrexate. See our medicines section above for more information.  If your fallopian tube ruptures, you may need to have emergency surgery to stop the internal bleeding. You may also need fluids and a blood transfusion if the internal bleeding is severe.  If you have an ectopic pregnancy, your surgeon may do a laparotomy. During a laparotomy your surgeon does the operation through one large cut in your abdomen. In general, your surgeon will try to do keyhole surgery as the procedure and recovery times are shorter. However, they may need to convert the procedure to a laparotomy.  Causes of ectopic pregnancy  The cause is unknown for more than half of women who have an ectopic pregnancy. But there are some factors that can make it more likely that you’ll have one.  An ectopic pregnancy can develop if your fallopian tubes are damaged. The most common cause of this is a past infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease . If your fallopian tubes have been damaged, they may become inflamed, narrowed or scarred. This makes it harder for the fertilised egg to pass down them to your womb.   Other things that make an ectopic pregnancy more likely include:   having a previous ectopic pregnancy  a history of infertility (whether or not this was treated)  getting pregnant when using certain types of contraception – see our FAQ: Contraception and ectopic pregnancy for further information  smoking – may damage the tiny hair cells that normally help the fertilised egg move along the fallopian tube  being over 35  having had a sterilisation operation – if the surgery fails and you get pregnant, it’s possible this may be an ectopic pregnancy    It isn’t possible to prevent an ectopic pregnancy but you can reduce your risk. These include quitting smoking and taking measures to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) , which can damage your fallopian tubes.  Help and support  It’s important to recognise that an ectopic pregnancy can affect you emotionally as well as physically. You may feel sadness and a sense of loss after having an ectopic pregnancy. If you can, try to talk to someone about these feelings. Ask your doctor for information about support that’s available to you.  FAQ: Can an ectopic pregnancy develop normally?  No, ectopic pregnancies aren’t able to develop properly. It isn’t possible for a pregnancy to survive if it implants outside your womb. Only your womb provides the right environment for a baby to grow and receive all the nutrition it needs.  Because an ectopic pregnancy can’t survive, the most important thing to consider when deciding on treatment is your health.  FAQ: Can certain types of contraception increase my risk of ectopic pregnancy?  It’s very unlikely that you’ll become pregnant if you’re using contraception correctly. But if you do, there’s a risk with some types of contraception that your pregnancy is more likely to be ectopic. This risk is associated with the intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine system (IUS) and the progestogen-only pill (POP). Desogestrel – a type of POP – isn’t associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.   Of those women using the IUS and IUD who do become pregnant, four in every 100 have an ectopic pregnancy. Of those using the POP, 10 in every 100 pregnancies are ectopic. Overall, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy isn’t actually increased by using these contraceptives. This is because the overall risk of becoming pregnant goes down.  If you think you might be pregnant, go and see your GP as soon as possible. If you do have an ectopic pregnancy, it is easier to treat and the risk of complications is lower if it is diagnosed early on.  FAQ: Can I get pregnant again after an ectopic pregnancy?  For most women who have had an ectopic pregnancy, the chance of having a normal pregnancy afterwards is good. Even if you had your fallopian tube removed to treat the ectopic pregnancy, your chance of conceiving may only be slightly reduced. Two out of three women who have had a tube removed are able to conceive normally.  However, you may be more likely to have another ectopic pregnancy. Between one in five and one in 10 women will have another ectopic pregnancy. The risk rises to one in three women after two or more ectopic pregnancies. This is because if you have had an ectopic pregnancy, one of your fallopian tubes is likely to have been damaged or even removed. However, this will depend on the type of treatment you had.  If you get pregnant again, it’s important to see your GP as soon as you find out. You’ll need to have an ultrasound scan six to seven weeks into your pregnancy to check the embryo is developing in your womb. An ultrasound uses sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your body.  FAQ: Can untreated ectopic pregnancy lead to cancer?  There’s no link between untreated ectopic pregnancy and cancer. The biggest risk of an untreated ectopic pregnancy that continues to grow is that your fallopian tube could rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding. If you think you may have an ectopic pregnancy, you should contact a doctor.  There’s a very rare type of cancer that can start from cells of any type of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy. It is called choriocarcinoma and is very treatable. Nearly all women are cured. This type of cancer only happens in about one in 50,000 pregnancies, so the chance of getting it after an ectopic pregnancy is extremely low.

Perkins also has extensive experience working in home health with medically fragile pediatric patients.            A woman is holding a home pregnancy test.  Photo Credit: banarfilardhi/iStock/Getty Images          It's possible to have what appears to be a period, even if you're pregnant. It's also possible to have a negative home pregnancy test and still be pregnant. If you think you might be pregnant, even though you're having vaginal bleeding and you have a negative pregnancy test, talk to your medical provider. While you might be experiencing implantation spotting or be testing too early, you might also have a pregnancy complication such as an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. If you have a lot of bleeding or notice other symptoms like dizziness or severe abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention.   Video of the Day             Implantation Bleeding  As many as 25 percent of women have some bleeding in early pregnancy, according to an article published in June of 2009 in "American Family Physician." Some women experience bleeding -- often called implantation bleeding -- around the time of their first missed period, even though they're pregnant. Implantation bleeding occurs when the embryo burrows into the uterine lining. This may seem like a period, but the bleeding is generally less and lasts for a shorter time than your normal period. If you do a home pregnancy test at this time, it might read as negative even though you're pregnant.            Testing Too Early  Home pregnancy tests measure the level of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine. Usually, hCG levels rise rapidly in the first 2 months of pregnancy. Tests vary widely in their ability to detect an early pregnancy. While hCG levels greater than 6.3 mIU/mL can indicate that you're pregnant as early as the time of your first missed period, many tests don't read as positive until urine hCG levels increase to 25 to 100 mIU/mL or higher. Despite claims of accuracy on the packaging, over-the-counter tests can often fail to detect hCG early in pregnancy.  Bleeding in Early Pregnancy  At least 15 percent of pregnancies end in a miscarriage, according to an article published in July of 2011 in "American Family Physician." If you had a positive pregnancy test but now have a negative test and vaginal bleeding, you may be having an early miscarriage. Talk to your doctor if you suspect a miscarriage. Often no specific treatment is needed, but if you are experiencing a large amount of bleeding or feel dizzy or faint, obtain immediate medical care.  Ectopic Pregnancy  As many as 2 percent of pregnancies implant outside the uterus, usually in one of the fallopian tubes. This is called an "ectopic" pregnancy. In an ectopic pregnancy, your hCG levels might not rise as quickly as they would in a pregnancy that implants in the uterus. In this case, you might have a negative home pregnancy test because the hCG levels are too low to detect. Bleeding will also occur as the ectopic pregnancy progresses and the embryo grows too large for the fallopian tube. Eventually, the tube can rupture, producing severe abdominal pain and other symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, or vomiting. Seek immediate medical attention if you think you may have an ectopic pregnancy.                       Lose Weight. Feel Great!

I done 100s of hpt and had 3 blood tests and an ultrasound.
I was driving myself crazy and wasting a lot of money on hpts and doctors visits. I&#39;m not a gambler but these past weeks I&#39;ve felt like a secret pokies addict guiltily sneaking off to pee on a stick thinking maybe this time I&#39;ll get my two little lines. 
I have much empathy for all the women out there like myself who have a secret hpt addiction it is very real and causes a lot of distress every time the test is bfn.
I am a Christian and finally I decided to pray about my predicament instead of driving my doctor mad and driving to pharmacies all over auckland to buy hpts.
Anyway I got my answer and stopped doing the tests having faith that I had heard right, 6weeks into pregnancy it has finally been confirmed.

My breasts are sore, hard tummy, mild nausea but worse after I eat, back ache, crampy, but not like PMS cramps at all much higher than those. I've NEVER been late with my period, EVER! I'd only be about 5 weeks along, but mom who works at an OB/GYN office and he co-workers all say I'm pregnant, but that the Hcg levels are not high enough to register yet. Am going to painstakingly wait the week out to see what happens and then go for a blood test. I'm so glad I'm not alone with this waiting game! Oh, and I didn't find out I was pregnant with my first and only child until I was 10 weeks along. Good luck to everyone waiting with me!                 Number4?!?

Now, I am starting to look pregnant (along with all the symptoms)...I will be having an ultrasound in two weeks. So if I am pregnant, i will know for sure at week 18. My Mother In Law's third one was testing negative at four months as well.                 Mrs_R_Wilkins    Answered 1/16/08               72 found this helpful     I've had two kids, and I think the longest I had to wait was about 6 1/2 weeks-7 weeks. Lonnnngest wait! However, it was cuz the HcG levels were too low to be detected...not cuz I wasn't pregnant. I'm in the waiting process now, myself at just over 5 weeks. HPT tests show the FAINTEST positive lines--which I'm not 100% sure is actually a positive...but I'm having all the pregnancy signs--including morning sickness. So, not knowing this time is REALLY frustrating. Hopefully, you'll get the results you want REALLY soon. I know the wait is a bear!                 smiliemama2009    Answered 12/30/07               60 found this helpful           / 96                 Reason for reporting   Offensive or inappropriate materials  Spamming or advertising  Vulgarity or profanity  Personal attack  Invasion of privacy  Copyright infringement       Cancel    Submit       Thank you for your feedback.

The BabyCenter Editorial Team     The accuracy of a home pregnancy test depends on how and when you take the test, so it's possible that your negative pregnancy test result is not be accurate. What's a false negative pregnancy test result? A "false negative" pregnancy test result shows that you're not pregnant when you are. Why do false negative pregnancy test results happen? The test was taken too soon. If you take a home pregnancy test very soon after you think you may have conceived , or if you didn't follow the test instructions correctly, you might get a false negative test result. A home pregnancy test will be positive only if it detects the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). When an egg is fertilized after you ovulate , it takes about a week to travel through a fallopian tube to the uterus. And your body starts producing hCG only after a fertilized egg implants in the uterus . If it's very early in your pregnancy, your body might not have produced enough hCG yet. In that case, you'd get a negative result at first. Also, some tests are more sensitive than others, and no test is 100 percent accurate. And a few women have such low levels of hCG during pregnancy that home tests can't measure it. Although some tests can detect hCG the first day you miss your period, you'll have a better chance of getting an accurate result if you wait a week. Don't time the test based on when you think you might have conceived. Sperm can live in the fallopian tubes for up to five days, so it's possible you conceived several days after having sex. Hormones were low. For the most accurate result, follow the test instructions exactly, and take the test when you first get up in the morning. That's the time when your urine – and any hCG – is the most concentrated. What if the test is taken correctly and I get a negative result? If you're sure you've waited long enough to test and you're still getting a negative result , you're probably not pregnant. Pregnancy isn't the only reason for a missed period – stress, too much exercise, and thyroid problems, among other things, can all delay menstruation. If your period is weeks late without a positive test result, talk to your doctor to figure out whether you're pregnant or need help getting your menstrual cycle on track. How do home pregnancy tests work? Pregnancy tests can bring exciting news. Find out how they work, how to take one, and what factors could lead to seeing a false positive or negative.

However, most medications, including antibiotics and birth control pills, don't affect the accuracy of home pregnancy tests.   Could a positive result be wrong?    Although rare, it's possible to get a positive result from a home pregnancy test when you're not actually pregnant. This is known as a false-positive.  A false-positive might happen if you had a pregnancy loss soon after the fertilized egg attached to your uterine lining (biochemical pregnancy) or you take a pregnancy test too soon after taking a fertility drug that contains HCG. An ectopic pregnancy, menopause or problems with your ovaries also might contribute to misleading test results.   Could a negative result be wrong?    It's possible to get a negative result from a home pregnancy test when you're actually pregnant. This is known as a false-negative — and it's much more likely to occur than is a false-positive. You might get a false-negative if you:   Take the test too early. The earlier after a missed period that you take a home pregnancy test, the harder it is for the test to detect HCG. For the most accurate results, take the test one week after a missed period — when the level of HCG in your urine is most likely to be detectable. If you can't wait that long, ask your health care provider for a blood test.  Check test results too soon. Be sure to give the test time to work. Consider setting a timer according to the package instructions.  Use diluted urine. For the most accurate results, take the test first thing in the morning — when your urine is the most concentrated.   What happens next?    Based on your test results, consider taking the following steps:   Your home pregnancy test is positive, or you've taken a few home pregnancy tests and gotten mixed results. Make an appointment with your health care provider. You might need a blood test or ultrasound to confirm your pregnancy. The sooner your pregnancy is confirmed, the sooner you can begin prenatal care.  Your home pregnancy test is negative. If your period doesn't begin, repeat the test in a few days or one week — especially if you took the test before or shortly after a missed period.  You continue to get negative test results, but your period doesn't begin or you still think you might be pregnant. Check with your health care provider. Many factors can lead to missed menstrual periods (amenorrhea), including thyroid disorders, low body weight, problems with your ovaries, excessive exercise and stress. If you're not pregnant, your health care provider can help you get your menstrual cycle back on track.    Previous  Share Tweet  Dec. 02, 2015  References   Bastian LA, et al.

Some women are actively trying to achieve a pregnancy so that they can begin a family. Others are active in trying to prevent a pregnancy because they are not ready to start a family. When there is a question about whether a pregnancy has happened, a pregnancy test is a fast and affordable way of being able to determine if you may be pregnant and need to visit a doctor.  Statistics About Pregnancy Test False Negatives  1. 46% of women were with their partner when they found out about the results of the first pregnancy test.  2. 62% of women in a recent survey didn’t trust the positive result from their home pregnancy test and took at least one more test just to make sure.  3. The percentage of women who head to the doctor’s office to get a confirmation test from a positive pregnancy test result: 52%.  4. Home pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone called hCG that a woman’s body starts releasing once a fertilized egg has implanted in the uterus.  5. Up to 60% of women who think they may be pregnant take the pregnancy test up to 1 week to soon and this can create a negative result.  6. 34% of women who became mothers and used a pregnancy test used at least two of them as a method to confirm the results in the same cycle they conceived and received different results.  7. 65.1% of pregnancy tests reported by women who took one 8 days past ovulation reported having a negative result.  8. The percentage of negative pregnancy test results from women who were pregnant at 21 days past ovulation: 8.3%.  9. It usually takes 10 days after conception for a fertilized egg to be implanted into the uterus.  10. Each woman ovulates at a different time in her menstrual cycle, accounting for some of the statistics of false negative pregnancy tests.  11. Problems with a pregnancy can affect the amount of hCG in the urine and account for false negative readings as well.  12. In up to 10% of women, implantation does not occur until after the first day of a missed period. This means some women get accurate results just 1 day after a missed period.  13. At any given time in the United States, up to 7% of the female population may be pregnant.  14. Assuming that the 99% accuracy claims of a pregnancy test are true, a woman has a 9% chance of not being pregnant with a positive result.  15. The odds of a woman being pregnant and receiving a false negative would be less than 5%.  16. Home pregnancy tests have been found to be 97% accurate when they are used according to their instructions and the results are read at the appropriate time.  17. 25% of women do not achieve a positive pregnancy test result from a urine test until after they miss their first period.   Common Results Among Pregnant Women  Or is it? Even for women who are pregnant, it is common to have a negative result first from a pregnancy test. This first negative, which is called a false negative, can create joy or disappointment depending on each woman’s perspective. The only problem is that these tests are not 100% reliable, especially in the earliest days of a pregnancy.  That’s why the results of a pregnancy test need to be taken like a grain of salt. It is information that can be used, but it is also information that should be verified. If you are concerned about a pregnancy, then a visit to the family doctor is enough to confirm the results of a pregnancy test or determine that they are false. Many women are actually choosing to go to the doctor first when they think they are pregnant because of the history of false negatives that are associated with the modern retail pregnancy test.  As statistics will show, even though women still purchase pregnancy tests every day, a majority of them do not put their full confidence into the results that are displayed.      Understanding False Negatives  The good news is that a majority of false negative tests can be attributed to user error. By following the instructions on the packaging, most women are going to be able to get the accurate information that they need to determine what their next choices should be regarding a pregnancy.  If you have recently had a negative result on a pregnancy test, the best recommendation is to wait a few days and then try the test again. A negative result may mean that you are not pregnant. It may also mean that you decided to take the test earlier than recommended or that you may have taken the test incorrectly. If you have received different answers from different pregnancy tests on the same cycle, then the best solution is to visit the family doctor to get an accurate blood test done to confirm at least one of the results.  Even blood tests provide a false negative, however, if they are taken too early. This is why it is important to wait until about 10 days after a missed cycle before taking any testing. Some women may be able to determine a pregnancy just 1 day after their missed cycle, but there’s a 90% chance that the average woman isn’t going to fit into that group. That can be a long time to wait, whether a woman wants the pregnancy or not, but it is better to have accurate information at the end of the process than base beliefs off of inaccurate information instead.  For most women, two weeks is the longest they will need to wait in order to get the most accurate pregnancy test. This is because menstruation happens about 14 days after ovulation. False negatives occur because an ovulation period is later than it is supposed to be. Having a follow-up test on a negative result at 21 days shows statistically that most pregnancies can be determined at home. By being patient, the right results will typically shine through.

Can a Pregnancy Test Give a False Negative?  You took an at-home pregnancy test , and it said you're not pregnant . But what are the chances you got a false negative pregnancy test result? By Elena Donovan Mauer  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         michaeljung/Shutterstock.com  You've probably heard "I didn't know I was pregnant" stories that went something like this: A woman claims she took an at-home pregnancy test that came back negative, but, lo and behold, she really was pregnant -- and the pregnancy progressed without her knowledge. It's a scary thought, but you shouldn't worry about it happening to you. False negative pregnancy tests don't really happen, as long as you're taking the test correctly. But there are some reasons why you could get a negative reading when you're actually pregnant -- so this is what to avoid: Taking the test too early Even if you're champing at the bit to know whether or not you're expecting, wait until you've missed your period to take the test. "Home pregnancy tests are a qualitative test and measure whether or not hCG -- the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin -- is present in your urine," explains Stephen Rechner, M.D., the Division Chief of General Obstetrics and Gynecology at Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids. "A detectable amount of this hormone is typically not seen until after the first missed period." Wondering if you're pregnant? Take our quiz! After your period was due, the accuracy of your home pregnancy test is 97 percent, says Sean Daneshmand, M.D., an ob-gyn based in San Diego and the founder of the nonprofit organization Miracle Babies. The remaining 3 percent may simply need a little more time. Because women's menstrual cycles can vary, those women may not have enough hCG for the test to pick up yet. "If you receive a negative pregnancy test, you should wait a few days and try it again," says Dr. Rechner. HCG levels in your blood increase rapidly if you really are pregnant -- they should double approximately every 48 hours -- so you should be able to trust the negative test result if you took the test about a week after you missed your period. Most women find out they're pregnant about four to six weeks after the first day of their last period, says Dr. Daneshmand. How Accurate are Pregnancy Tests? Using an expired pregnancy test Be selective when you buy your pregnancy test. Check the box to make sure it hasn't passed its expiration date, in which case it probably won't work properly, says Dr. Daneshmand. Taking the test incorrectly Follow the instructions that come with your pregnancy test carefully to be sure you're taking it the right way. Dr. Rechner advises taking the test first thing in the morning, as the concentration of hCG in your urine is usually highest then.

Merely Me   , Community Member   Reviewed by: Peter J. Chen, MD, FACOG          Credit: iStock   One of the most frequent questions we get here on Sexual Health Connection is from women wanting to know if they are pregnant. I addressed this issue in my article " Am I Pregnant? How to Know." A variation of this theme are women who have taken a home pregnancy test or even several of them and they turn out negative. The question we then get is: “Can I still be pregnant even though my home pregnancy test is negative?”      So for this article, I researched the reasons why these tests can sometimes yield an inaccurate result and how you can up the odds for having more accurate test results.  How do home pregnancy tests work?  The National Women’s Health Information Center tells us that all types of pregnancy tests attempt to detect a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG. This “pregnancy hormone” is made when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. It varies from woman to woman how long this implantation can take. For most women this happens about six days after the egg is fertilized by the sperm but for some women implantation can occur as late as the first day of the missed period. Each day after implantation, the amount of hCG in your system will increase rapidly.  There are two different types of pregnancy tests. One type of pregnancy test is a blood test given by your doctor. A blood test combined with a pelvic exam can be considered the most reliable way to see if you are pregnant. The second type of pregnancy test uses a urine sample and this can be performed at the doctor’s office or at home using a home pregnancy test. If you use a home pregnancy test, most commonly you will be instructed to hold a stick in your urine stream where an absorbent strip will collect the urine for testing. Directions are given with each test kit to determine if you are pregnant such as seeing a plus or minus sign and now there are some tests which even show the word “pregnant” in the test results window of the test stick. So it is now easier than ever to test for pregnancy in the privacy and convenience of your own home.      But are home pregnancy tests always accurate? It seems the answer depends mostly upon how you use the test.  What types of errors occur with using a home urine pregnancy test?  There are two ways that a home urine pregnancy test can be inaccurate. One type of error is to have a false positive reading. This means that although your pregnancy test indicates that you are positive for pregnancy, you are not really pregnant. The other error which can occur is that you get a false negative result. This means that although your test says that you are not pregnant, you really are pregnant.  Most times when there is an error with home pregnancy tests it is caused by not following the directions given with the test. Bastian et al (1998) found that most false negative results are due to users not using the kits properly. If used correctly most home pregnancy tests have a high degree of reliability although some brands may be more accurate than others.  Does the brand of home urine pregnancy test make a difference in reliability and accuracy?      Indeed the brand of test you use can impact upon the accuracy of results. A Wellsphere article entitled, “Sensitivity Chart Home Pregnancy Tests” provides us with an easy to read chart comparing the Sensitivity (or the hCG threshold at which a positive result is indicated). One brand of home pregnancy test which shows a high level of sensitivity for detecting hCG and has been cited in the literature consistently as being the most reliable and accurate test is the First Response Early Result Pregnancy Test. In 2003 Consumer Reports senior editor Nancy Metcalf talked about the best pregnancy tests on CBS’s The Morning Show . Consumer Reports had tested 18 brands of home pregnancy tests and the First Response Early Result Pregnancy Test was found to be the most reliable and sensitive test kit, detecting hCG at concentrations as low as 6.5 mIU/ml. Metcalf reported that this test was super sensitive enough to detect any pregnancy soon after implantation.      Possible reasons for a false negative if you ARE pregnant    It is estimated that in 10 percent of pregnant women, the embryo does not implant until after the first day of the missed period and as late as a week after a missed period, three percent of pregnancies still hadn’t implanted. So if you take the test too early your hCG levels might not be detected due to implantation occurring later than usual. (source: “The Best Pregnancy Tests” by Tatiana Morales)    The urine is too dilute.    The pregnancy is developing abnormally and a miscarriage is happening.    Miscalculation of when your period was actually due leading to taking the test too early to detect hCG levels.    Possible reasons for a false positive test result if your test is positive but you’re NOT pregnant:        Some medications and drugs which reportedly can cause you to have a false positive home pregnancy test result. These drugs include: Methadone, methyldopa (used to treat hypertension), diuretics and promethazine (used to treat allergy symptoms and nausea). Some tranquilizers and antidepressants are reported to be able to cause a false positive result, as well as large doses of aspirin.    You are taking a fertility drug which contains hCG.    Some medical conditions such as rare cancers, trophoblastic disease, ovarian cysts, and thyroid disorders can sometimes create false-positive results.    The egg never implants properly or else spontaneously aborts soon after implantation. It is estimated that up to a third of all conceptions implant and then fail. If you take the test too early you may be in for disappointment when your period comes despite a positive test result. Because only positive hCG is detected and a clinical pregnancy never developed, doctors sometimes call this clinical scenario “chemical pregnancy.”        You let the test sit too long before reading the result. If you read the test results after the instructed time period, a faint positive may appear which will be inaccurate if read at that time.    Ways to get the most accurate test results from a home pregnancy test    The literature is consistent with advice to take a home pregnancy test a week after your missed period. This will give most eggs a chance to implant and also your hCG levels will be more detectable.    Use your first morning urine as it will be more concentrated and hCG will be more easily detected.    Use a reliable and sensitive brand of home pregnancy test.    Make sure to follow the directions given with the home pregnancy kit. Always read the results in the time frame indicated or they may be inaccurate.    Make sure that you are not using an expired test. Check the expiration date on the box.        Buy at least two tests. If you are doubtful or unsure of the first test results, take another test in a week.    If you have taken two or more pregnancy tests and you still have concerns, schedule an appointment with your doctor or gynecologist. They will be able to give you a blood test for pregnancy as well as conduct a pelvic exam to see what is going on. For peace of mind see your doctor.    I hope this post was helpful to anyone who is wondering whether or not they may be pregnant. It can be an especially anxious time. Home pregnancy tests are mostly reliable but some things can affect the accuracy of your results. The best advice I can give is to be patient. It can be difficult to wait but if you want to be more certain of your test results, wait at least a week after your period to take a test. And then check with your doctor if there is any confusion.

She is a mother to 3 children from 4-25 years old. Contact Author   Reasons for a negative pregnancy test result       Do you feel sure that you're pregnant but ended up with one or more negative pregnancy test results and still no period? You're not alone—getting a negative test with a missed period is more common than you might think. While home pregnancy tests have improved over the years and are an extremely accurate predictor of pregnancy, there have still been many instances of a test giving a false negative result.   How Home Pregnancy Tests Work At-home pregnancy tests work by testing a small sample of urine for hCG—human chorionic gonadotrophin. hCG is the pregnancy hormone that is produced by the developing embryo and, later, by part of the placenta.  Measuring the hCG via home pregnancy tests is qualitative, which explains why the results are a plain ‘yes’/‘no’ or ‘negative’/‘positive’.   Most Common Reasons for a Late Period and Negative Pregnancy Test Dr. Stuart Spitalnic from Brown University asserts that "taking the test too early and not being pregnant are the main reasons for a negative test." If you take the test too early, then your hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) hormone levels are too low for the test to detect. Missing your period means that you ovulated later than usual. Wait two weeks after your period is missed , and  take the test again for an accurate result.  "A very dilute urine (over-hydrating to "study" for the test) is another cause," says Dr. Spitalnic. Don't drink too much water before taking the test. For best results, test the first pee in the morning.   Reasons for a negative pregnancy test and no period.       What Causes a Late Period or No Period and a Negative Pregnancy Test? 1. You Are Pregnant, but You Took the Test Too Early  Pregnancy tests work by detecting the pregnancy hormone hCG. If you are pretty sure you are pregnant because you've been experiencing some early pregnancy symptoms but have a negative test result, one of the most common reasons is that you have taken the pregnancy test too early, and your body has not produced enough hCG hormone for the test to detect it. hCG can be detected in the urine only at a minimum of two weeks after conception occurs. For a 99% accurate test result, the test needs to detect at least 25 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). In the first two weeks of pregnancy, only about 10 mlU/ml of hCG is present.  So, to get a reliable test result, wait two weeks after your period is missed . By this time, your body will be creating plenty of hCG, and your home pregnancy test will be far more accurate.  2. You Are Pregnant, but the Test Is Faulty  The test may have expired, or it may have been stored improperly (e.g. in a wet bathroom cabinet). Buy a new test, and try again to make sure the results are accurate.  3. You Are Pregnant, but You Have Irregular Periods and Late Ovulation  If you have irregular menstrual cycles, then having a negative test but no period might mean that your ovulation was simply late this month. This will ultimately delay the implantation date, which might have caused you to miscount the number of days when you can finally take the test. This is why it's advisable to test a week or two after the day you were expecting your period. If you conceived late in the month, your hCG levels could very well be lower than the pregnancy test can detect, therefore resulting in a false negative.  Your menstrual cycle can be divided into two phases: the follicular phase, which begins on the first day of your period and ends when you ovulate, and the luteal phase, which begins after ovulation and ends when your next period starts. The luteal phase usually lasts 11-13 days and doesn't vary much, but the follicular phase could be affected by physical or mental changes, such as exercise, stress, diet, etc.  A negative test and no period could just mean that your period is late because your ovulation started later. Women with irregular periods have a longer window for ovulation, and thus, are particularly prone to miscounting and even having skipped periods. If you keep getting a negative test but still have no period, then you should consult with your doctor. Major changes in your cycle can be symptoms of other conditions, including but not limited to pregnancy.  4. You Are Pregnant, but You Are Too Far Along in Your Pregnancy  Dr. Ann Gronowski, professor of pathology and immunology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis calls this the "variant hook effect." She explains that part of the problem is that "hCG comes in many different isoforms, and after five weeks of pregnancy, you get much more of one variant form (called the beta core fragment) than you get of the hCG intact molecule." In other words, at-home pregnancy tests are intended to detect early molecular forms of hCG. After five weeks of pregnancy, the hCG's molecular structure changes and that structure is unable to be detected as effectively, sometimes resulting in a false negative. This is when a serum test (done through blood work) would be your best option for accuracy.  5. You Are Pregnant With Twins or Triplets  Carrying two or more babies causes a woman to produce very high levels of hCG and at-home pregnancy tests may not be able to detect it because there's actually too much. This is known as the "high-dose hook effect."  Dr. Gronowski explains that hCG tests work by forming a "sandwich" with two antibodies as the "bread" and the hCG molecule as the "meat." When the hCG concentration is too high, it saturates both antibodies, and there are so many molecules that the antibodies can't form a sandwich, resulting in a negative pregnancy result. Some women report positive results after diluting their urine with water, however, a blood test at the doctor's office is a better option for accuracy.  6. You Have an Ectopic Pregnancy That Delays the Production of hGC  An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants itself somewhere other than the uterus (usually in the fallopian tube), which delays the production of hCG hormones and causes severe pain in the lower abdomen or to one side. This condition is rare and occurs in only 1 out of 40 pregnancies, but it is very dangerous and must be diagnosed early to prevent life-threatening consequences for the woman.  7. You Are Pregnant, but You Have Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD)  This is extremely rare. Gestational trophoblastic disease occurs when tumors form in the layer of cells called the  trophoblast  that normally surrounds an embryo. The most common form of GTD is called the hydatidiform mole, also known as a molar pregnancy. These tumors are rarely cancerous, but the pregnancy usually ends in miscarriage because the embryo cannot form. Very rarely can a healthy baby emerge from a GTD pregnancy.  8. You Are Not Pregnant, and Your Period Is Late for Other Reasons  There are several other medical conditions that can result in a negative pregnancy test and no period, which is why it's always wise to see your doctor if this occurs. Some conditions that may cause your periods to stop unexpectedly are ovarian cysts, hyperthyroidism, polycystic ovarian disease, high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), menopause, anorexia, secondary amenorrhea, obesity and adrenal cancer.  Changes in your diet can also result in changes to your menstrual cycle. The ketogenic diet or any diet that puts your body into a ketogenic state on a long term basis can affect your cycle. One study in teenagers who ate a ketogenic diet to control a particular type of epilepsy found that 45% of subjects reported menstrual changes as a side effect.  9. You Didn't Follow Instructions Correctly  Read the instructions on your home pregnancy test’s package carefully so that you can administer the test properly—the test is only as good as your ability to follow the instructions! Since the tests are qualitative, this makes them sensitive to the process of testing. Most home pregnancy tests ask you to hold a test strip in urine, and pee on it while on the toilet. Some make you dip the test strip in a clean cup where you have collected the urine (my preferred method for an accurate pregnancy test result).       How to Get an Accurate Pregnancy Test Result • Get the first urine in the morning. The first pee of the day is the best urine to use to ensure accuracy because it's so much more concentrated from having collected in the bladder overnight. • Drinking too much water can dilute the urine, which may result in a false negative. • Results may also be affected by medications you are taking. They can mask the presence of hCG or affect their sensitivity. If in doubt, consult your pharmacist or doctor. • Visit a doctor for an ultrasound.   HCG Levels Aren't the Same for Everyone A slow rate of hCG production is another good explanation for a negative test and no period. Not everybody is built the same—levels of hCG produced vary from woman to woman. If you tested too early or your body is not making enough hCG for the test to pick up, then you'll get a false negative.  As previously stated, home pregnancy tests are usually very accurate. However, there are, of course, times when they are less so, and this is one instance where that could happen. While these tests have become better over the years, it’s always best to get your test result confirmed. The confirmatory tests are usually diagnostic procedures done by your doctor. This may involve a verification of the gestational sac and fetal parts using ultrasound, the detection of a fetal heartbeat, and the detection of fetal movements by a trained examiner.   Don't Rely Solely on the Test; Look for Symptoms Remember, don’t just rely on home pregnancy testing because stressing over a negative test with no period isn’t worth it, especially when there is the possibility of having another life to take care of.  Read up on what a woman experiences during early pregnancy and the symptoms you can expect to experience. Listen to your body as well. If you firmly suspect that you are pregnant or your period still hasn't arrived after a few weeks, set an appointment with your doctor without delay to find out for sure.

So I'm now three weeks late. Last period was November 22nd, December she was a no show. I did (without realizing I was ovulating) have a... good amount of unprotected sex. I'm twenty four, and have been having extremely* regular periods for the past ten years. I've been way more stressed out than i was when i initally missed my period and I have NEVER missed a period. I've now taken four home pregnancy tests that all came back negative. I went to the doctor on January second and talked to her. She took a blood which came back negative for pregnancy stds and anemia. I also had her check me for pneumonia, and thyroid issues. All of which are normal and not the problem. I'm feeling nauseous without any actual vomiting, unable to control my body temp, very tired, sensitive to smells and just overall strange. In the past few days my boobs have gotten sore, nipples are so tender. Peeing all the time, cant poop. I did have some mild cramping and very light pink/brownish spotting shortly after I think I would * have conceived. I'm feeling notable lower back pain. Vivid dreams, uncharacteristic forgetfulness. Dull pain in what is (I had to look up the body part) my round ligament and I swear to God the other night when I got up to pee... a clear jelly fish came out of me... tmi I know sorry, but it was the weirdest thing. Totally clear/ some cloudy white spots and it was almost solid... Like viscous. Odorless but still very strange. I have another appointment on the eleventh for a pelvic exam and I'm hoping that will give me an answer. Is there any chance a pelvic exam could also be inconclusive? If I have to miss another period before I get an answer I might go crazy.

Gabby 3 months ago  I have not gotten my period and I took a pregnancy test and it came out negative and no period plz someone help me  Vaness 3 months ago  Hi ma'am, I'm already 6 days late with ny period and I tried 2 PT's, it came out negative. I'm experiencing cramps and breast soreness. I'm just 19 years old. I had my LMP on Nov.24 and we had sex (my bf and I, ofcourse) on Dec.4. Please, help me. I don't know what's happening to me. :(  Dia 3 months ago  I had always 28 days gap between my two periods. But on 15th August, I had 15 days gaps approx. between my two periods. I visit my home country Bangladesh, met with a doctor. She did some ultrasound and said that I have some infections. So I took some antibiotics suggested by doctor. My next period was in 20th September, 25 days gap. Due to taking antibiotics, I lost my appetite extremely and was feeling so sick. So another doctor suggested me tablet Varigestrol 1+0+1 for 14 days. My height is 4 feet 11 inch. My average weight was 42 kg. But after taking the antibiotics, I became 40 kg. Then I came back Japan and started taking tablet varigestrol to improve my appetite. My appetite increased so much, I became 45 kg suddenly. Still now, I am 45 kg. But my next period was 37 days gap. I had so less bleeding. And my bleeding color surprised me a lot. So dark brown, then pink, then red (a white clot was also seen in that time), then dark brown and finished. Then I met with another gynecologist doctor in Japan and did some test. Pregnancy test was negative at that time.  Dr. suggested me tablet LUTORAL (1+0+1) for 7 days. My next period was 34 days late but it took 11 days to finish. First 4/5 days bleeding was so less, but after that normal bleeding started. Then I visited the doctor again to know the test result.I have no abdominal cancer, no thyroid problem etc. But my estrogen was .34. Doctor said that it is not a big problem. Doctor also suggested some medication to use in my vagina, for getting some bacteria in my vagina. And advised to notice that if I miss any period in the next. Today it is 40th day. But I am having no period. My age is 31 years old. I have no plan to take baby now. I am married and I take no pill, just use condom. I want to know, what is the problem going on in my body? Why it became so mysterious for myself.
