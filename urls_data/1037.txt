The Vikings are favored by 5.5 points, up two from the opening line. The Over-Under, or total number of points Vegas thinks will be scored, is 46.5, also up two from the opening line. Before you make any kind of pick on this matchup, you have to see who SportsLine stat geek R.J. White is backing. The 2017 NFL season has been extremely profitable if you've been listening to White. He is currently the site's No. 1 NFL expert and finished in the top one percent of the Las Vegas SuperContest -- his second cash in three years in the world's most prestigious handicapping competition. Last season, he finished in the top two percent. He followed that amazing regular season with a 3-1 performance against the spread on Wild Card Weekend and on Saturday, he correctly called the Patriots covering a nearly two-touchdown spread against the Titans. Anyone who has followed his picks is up big-time. Now, he's studied every angle of this battle between the champions of the NFC North and the NFC South and locked in his pick. He's only sharing it over at SportsLine. White knows the Saints have a huge edge when it comes to quarterback experience. This will be Minnesota quarterback Case Keenum's first postseason start, while Drew Brees has started a dozen playoff games and has a winning record that includes a Super Bowl MVP performance. SportsLine's advanced projection model says that Brees will throw for 250 yards and at least one touchdown on Sunday, with Michael Thomas being the best receiving bet to find the end zone. The Saints put together an eight-game winning streak in the middle of the season and won 11 of their last 14 overall before knocking off the Panthers on Wild Card Weekend. They've won three of their last four by double-digits. But just because the Saints have a loaded offense and played well late in the season doesn't mean they'll be able to go on the road and stay within the 5.5-point spread. Minnesota is no fluke as the No. 2 seed in the NFC. The Vikings got there with a dominant defense that was No. 1 in total defense and No. 1 in points allowed. And they were especially stingy at home, giving up just 12.5 points per contest at U.S. Bank Stadium. In their last three games at home, the Vikings allowed a total of 24 points to the Bears, Bengals, and Rams. In between at Lambeau Field, they delivered their first shutout over the Packers since 1971.    The Vikings and Saints met in Week 1, with the Vikings winning 29-19. QB Sam Bradford threw for a dazzling 346 yards and three touchdowns, while Dalvin Cook rushed for a season-high 127. On the other side of the ball, Brees had almost 300 yards passing and a score. Cook tore his ACL in Week 4 and missed the rest of the season, while Bradford was reactivated from IR on Saturday and is expected to back up Case Keenum. SportsLine's model says Keenum will throw for over 200 yards and two touchdowns, while Stefon Diggs has the best chance of any Minnesota pass-catcher of finding the end zone. It also says Vikings RB Latavius Murray, who has three touchdowns in his last three games, scores again. White has evaluated all of the circumstances and has identified a trend that nobody is talking about that has made him confidently back one side. Find out what it is, and who to back, over at SportsLine. So who is White backing on Sunday? Visit SportsLine now to see who you should back and what trend that nobody is talking about will determine the point-spread winner of Saints-Vikings, all from the man who finished in the top one percent of the nation's top handicapping tournament .

Can New Orleans extend that streak to five when it opens its season at Minnesota on Monday night? NFL point spread: The Vikings opened as 3.5-point favorites; the total was 48.5 early in the week, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark. (Line updates and matchup report) NFL betting pick, via OddsShark computer: 23.4-20.2 Vikings (NFL picks on every game)  Why the Saints can cover the spread The Saints started 0-3 last year and never quite recovered. They actually won seven of their next 12 games to make things interesting, before losing their finale to finish 7-9 for the third straight season. New Orleans lost seven games last year by six points or fewer , four by a field goal or less and three games in which it led or was tied for the lead in the fourth quarter. Going into this season the Saints are lined at +400 to win the NFC South (bet $100 to win $400), +2000 to win the NFC and +5000 to win the Super Bowl, with a win over/under total of eight. New Orleans led the NFL in total offense last year with 426.0 yards per game, and while the Saints defense only ranked 17th overall (375.4 YPG) , it came in 14th against the run (101.6 YPG) . With a little improvement on that side of the ball, New Orleans could win a few more of those close games and possibly return to the playoffs.  Why the Vikings can cover the spread The Vikings opened 5-0 last season, with wins over then-defending NFC champion Carolina and four other teams that ended up with winning records. Minnesota then went a bit cold offensively and lost eight of its last 11 games to finish 8-8. But four of those losses came by six points or fewer, including one in overtime, and two came in games the Vikings allowed just 16 and 17 points. Heading into this season Minnesota is getting +325 to win the NFC North, +1600 to win the NFC and +3300 to win the Super Bowl, with an over/under win total of 8.5. The Vikings only ranked 28th in total offense last season at 315.1 yards per game , but third in total defense, holding foes to 314.9 yards per game. With improvement offensively, the Vikings could win not just a couple more games but a division title.  Smart pick In matchups between great offenses and great defenses, the smart money on the Vegas lines usually resides with the defense. But not only did the Saints lead the league in yardage last year, they've added former Minnesota great Adrian Peterson . How much AP still has in the tank is uncertain, but emotion might elevate his game going against his former team in his former home. The smart play here is New Orleans.  NFL betting trends The Saints are 2-6 ATS in their last eight games against the Vikings. The total has gone over in six of the Saints' last eight games against the Vikings. The Vikings are 6-1 ATS in their last seven games at night.  All NFL odds and betting trends courtesy of Bleacher Report's official odds partner, OddsShark.

By  OddsShark    Jan 12, 2018,  8:00am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Saints vs. Vikings 2018 odds: New Orleans an underdog at Minnesota for Sunday      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports     The New Orleans Saints are 0-3 straight up and against the spread over their last three road games. After advancing to the divisional round with a win at home, the Saints will now be tasked with breaking their road losing streak this Sunday when they visit the Minnesota Vikings .  New Orleans is a 5-point road underdog in Minneapolis at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com. The betting underdog is just 3-16 SU in the last 19 NFL divisional games.   New Orleans Saints at Minnesota Vikings  When: Sunday, January 14, 4:40 p.m. ET  Where: U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, Minnesota  Betting Line / Total: Minnesota -5 / 46.5 Points  Saints at Vikings OddsShark Matchup Report   New Orleans Saints  Drew Brees put together a strong performance last Sunday against one of the league’s top defenses racking up 376 passing yards and two passing touchdowns while leading the Saints to a 31-26 victory over the Carolina Panthers.  The defense did its part too, fending off a potential game-winning drive for the Panthers with a late stand to preserve the lead. New Orleans won but failed to cover as 6.5-point favorites, falling to 2-6 ATS over their last eight games since going 6-1 ATS over their previous seven.  The Saints are just 1-6 SU and 2-5 ATS in their last seven postseason road games per the OddsShark NFL Database .   Minnesota Vikings  Minnesota stumbled out of the gate to a 2-2 SU and ATS record in 2017, but from that point forward emerged as one of the NFL’s most dominant teams.  The Vikings earned a first-round bye with an 11-1 SU and 9-3 ATS record over their last 12 games, finishing the year with the league’s best defense in both total yards (275.9) and points (15.8) allowed per game.  In addition to the team’s outstanding year on defense, the Vikings also got a breakout performance from third-string quarterback Case Keenum under center, who threw for 3,547 yards and 22 touchdowns. Minnesota, the second favorite on the updated odds to win Super Bowl 52 , is 7-2 ATS in its last nine games against New Orleans.  Sunday’s total is set at 46.5 points. The OVER is 7-2 in the last nine games between these two teams.  New Orleans ranked second in the NFL in total offense and fourth in scoring offense this season. The team with the elite defense tends to hold the edge in these offense vs. defense showdowns, but five points may be a difficult spread to cover against a Saints offense led by one of the game’s all-time great quarterbacks.

Adam  Thompson      @_Adam_Thompson_   Aug 29, 2:28PM EDT                            NEW ORLEANS SAINTS AT MINNESOTA VIKINGS (-3.5, O/U 48), Mon., 7:10 p.m. ET  The NFL scheduling committee must have some sense of humor, as Adrian Peterson, who ran over defenders for the Vikings for 10 seasons, returns to Minnesota for his first game since leaving via free agency.                    EXCLUSIVE TO SPORTSLINE PRO MEMBERS     Mon 09/11 7:10 PM EDT    New Orleans  +155  O/U 47.5    @ Minnesota  -175  -3       B      C      C        NO       MIN     VIEW FULL GAME ANALYSIS       LINE MOVEMENT, TRENDS  It?s one of the few games in which the line hasn't moved since it opened in April.  The Saints have covered in nine of their last 10 road games. Conversely, the Vikings have failed to cover in nine of their last 10 Monday night appearances.  Including playoffs, this is the fifth time since 2010 the teams have matched up; New Orleans has won the last four.  BREAKDOWN  The Vikings know what New Orleans? offense wants to do; they just need to stop it. Right?  Easier said than done.  Drew Brees ranked No. 1 in yards (5,208) and third in TDs (37) last year. The 38-year-old remains one of the formidable QBs in the league .   The team is without his top target from a year ago, Brandin Cooks. When WR Michael Thomas was the intended receiver, Brees? QB rating was a solid sixth. Speedster Ted Ginn was signed via free agency, though he was fifth in the league in drops with Carolina last year.  The Vikings have one of the more readymade defenses to handle Brees and Co. They ranked third in the NFL in pass defense last season, and Terence Newman (No. 2) and Xavier Rhodes (No. 10) were two of the NFL's best corners in pass coverage, per Pro Football Focus.  Minnesota wasn?t easy on backs, either, with top-10 run-stoppers at each level: Linval Joseph (No. 10 DT), Craig Robertson (No. 5 LB) and Harrison Smith (No. 6 safety). They?ll be ready for Peterson, who rushed six times for 15 yards in the Saints' third preseason game.  The Saints? defense was dead last against the pass last season; only the 49ers allowed more points.  But to its credit, New Orleans addressed glaring issues with the free-agent signings of LBs A.J. Klein and Manti T?eo and DT Nick Fairley, and the first-round selection of Ohio State CB Marshon Lattimore.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Sean Gardner/Getty Images      The Divisional Round of the 2018 NFL Playoffs concludes with an NFC showdown between the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints. Minnesota is coming off a bye and hoping to move one step closer to becoming the first team to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium, while the Saints will try to keep their momentum going after taking care of business against the NFC South rival Carolina Panthers during the Wild Card round. It’s an intriguing matchup that could be one of the best of the weekend if it lives up to the hype. The Philadelphia Eagles await the victor in the NFC Championship, a game in which today's winner will almost certainly be favored on the road against the conference's No. 1 seed:   Lookahead NFC Championship lines from BetOnline:  Eagles +4.5 vs Vikings Eagles +2.5 vs Saints  — OddsShark (@OddsShark) January 14, 2018   Oddsmakers have installed the Vikings as five-point chalk in this one, a seemingly fair line given how the Vikings thoroughly dismantled this opponent a few months ago at U.S. Bank Stadium. These foes previously met in the 2017 season-opener, a 29-19 Minnesota victory in which the offense gashed New Orleans’ defense for 470 total yards. The Saints would give up another 555 yards and 36 points to the New England Patriots in Week 2 before shoring up defensively and ripping off an eight-game winning streak that propelled them to a divisional crown and No. 4 seed in the conference.    The Vikings have also changed drastically since the opener, handing the keys of the offense over to Case Keenum after starter Sam Bradford went down with injury in Week 2. It’s been a brilliant decision thus far, as Minnesota’s offense came alive this year after ranking near the bottom of the league in 2016, pairing with a dominant defense to earn the NFC North title and the NFC’s No. 2 seed.  Will the Vikings live up to expectations and vanquish the Saints for the second time this season, or will New Orleans find a way to pick up a playoff “W” away from the Superdome—an issue the club has struggled with in the past, winning just one of seven road postseason contests in franchise history—on Sunday afternoon? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has sent along his analysis to go along with a winning pick against the spread.

New Orleans has faced Minnesota more than any other opponent it currently or has ever shared a division with. That isn’t a positive thing for the organization, as the Vikings hold a commanding lead in the all-time series, winning 21 of the 32 total contests—which includes a 2-1 postseason record—between the teams. Minnesota has been especially proficient at home against this foe, beating New Orleans 13 times in 16 tries. The Saints did come up with a big victory during their last playoff trip to the Twin Cities, however, winning an epic 2010 NFC Championship Game in overtime on their way to the first ever Super Bowl title for the franchise.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Hannah Foslien/Getty Images      The 2018 NFC Championship Game will feature the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings, the conference’s top two seeds. These teams capitalized on their Wild Card bye week, coming out fresh and winning in the Divisional Round. Not many expected either club to be competing Super Bowl this year, but both vastly exceeded expectations during the 2017 campaign and made a run to the NFL’s final four.  Despite being the No. 1 seed and having home field advantage, Philadelphia opened at most Vegas shops as a slight, three-point underdog to the Vikings. The Eagles will use this line as more bulletin board material, as getting points at home against the Atlanta Falcons fueled their 15-10 win against the No. 6 seed on Saturday.  Minnesota deserved the right to be favored, however, after edging past the high-powered New Orleans Saints, 29-24, on Sunday evening. The defense kept a Saints offense that averaged 28 points per game during the regular season to zero first half points and then survived a three-touchdown onslaught from future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees. The Vikings lost the lead after a New Orleans field goal with only a few minutes left, but won on an incredible, 61-yard, desperation walk-off touchdown connection from signal-caller Case Keenum to wideout Stefon Diggs. The Saints badly blew the coverage on the heave and missed a tackle that would have ended the game in their favor, opening the door for Minnesota to win its first ever Super Bowl.    NFL Stats showcased this incredible play:   The #Vikings beat the #Saints with a walk-off TD by Stefon Diggs.  They will play the Eagles next week in the NFC Championship game! pic.twitter.com/tY4UJnNk21  — NFL Stats (@NFL_Stats) January 15, 2018   It was an impressive feat and now the Vikings are one game closer to being the first organization to ever partake in a Super Bowl hosted in their home stadium. Before they can do that, they’ll need to escape Philly with a victory, something only one team has done this year. Here’s a look at the complete schedule, start time, TV info, opening line and more for both conference championship games:   2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide  Odds updated 1/19 at 11 a.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39.5      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook    The Eagles haven’t exactly thrived offensively since Nick Foles took over under center for the injured Carson Wentz, but that hasn’t stopped the club from winning. Foles is 3-1 as a starter, with his only loss coming in a meaningless regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys. The sixth-year man out of Arizona has only thrown for one touchdown in the three games since torching a shameful New York Giants defense for 237 yards and four scores in Week 15. Philadelphia’s offense has averaged a mere 11.3 points in that span, but the defense has picked up the slack when it matters most.  Atlanta came into the Divisional Round on the back of a convincing 26-13 road victory versus the Los Angeles Rams, but the Dirty Birds offense stalled out in the City of Brotherly Love. The Falcons generated only 281 yards and 10 points on Saturday, their lowest totals in both categories since a 14-9 loss to Minnesota in Week 13. Philadelphia’s best chance to win was keeping the Falcons from scoring more than a couple of touchdowns—Atlanta lost every game (0-7 including the playoffs) that it failed to reach 20 points—and dominate time of possession (the Eagles held the ball for over 32 minutes), two things it accomplished in the low-scoring affair. Those keys to victory will not change this week against the Vikings in the NFC Championship.  Eagles head coach Doug Pederson said that his players are sick of hearing that they aren't good enough to win in the playoffs and being made underdogs by the sportsbooks, as per ESPN :   When did Carson Wentz go down? Since that point, no one's given us a chance. I understand Carson's a great player, but every week our guys are hearing the same thing. Now, all of a sudden, we're not good enough? We're 13-3, best record in football, home-field advantage throughout. The guys are gonna motivate themselves based on what they've heard for the last month.

Here are our picks and predictions for the divisional-round game in Minneapolis.                   David Steele      @david_c_steele          Published on Jan. 14, 2018    Jan. 14, 2018           Watch NFL NFL with fuboTV    The Saints and Vikings met on the first Monday night of the season in Minneapolis … and will meet again in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.  However, there will be no Sam Bradford (except in emergency), no Dalvin Cook and no Adrian Peterson memorably scowling at Sean Payton. How quaint that was, worrying about how the 32-year-old future Hall of Famer would fit in.   MORE: Stream Saints-Vikings live and on-demand with fuboTV (7-day free trial)  Somehow the Saints turned Peterson into a footnote, and the Vikings did the same with Bradford, the quarterback they traded a first-round pick to get a year earlier. The Vikings won that night, 29-19, and managed to get better even without Bradford and Cook. The Saints’ three-man backfield has since turned into a two-headed monster of Mark Ingram and breakout rookie Alvin Kamara.  The Vikings have gotten a special season out of Case Keenum, worked around Cook's injury, unleashed another rugged version of Mike Zimmer’s defense, and threatened to make the NFC go through Minneapolis to get to the Super Bowl (in Minneapolis). And the Saints still have Drew Brees, who reminded everyone of who he is when needed in the wild-card win over the Panthers.  Enjoy the rematch between better versions of these teams, playing for much higher stakes.  NFL playoff picks: Saints at Vikings (-4)    Date, time: Sunday, 4:40 p.m. ET   Location: U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis   TV: FOX   Live streaming: FuboTV (free trial)   Odds: Vikings -4; total: 45.5    David Steele: Cut to the chase. The Saints of Brees, Ingram, Kamara, Michael Thomas lead the fourth-highest scoring offense in the NFL (and second in yards). They face off against the Vikings’ defense, giving up the fewest points and yards in the league and starting two first-team All-Pros in the secondary (Xavier Rhodes, Harrison Smith), and two other Pro Bowlers on the unit (Everson Griffen, Anthony Barr). The most fun will be when the Saints have the ball.  The most worrisome time for the Saints is when they don’t have it. Keenum had plenty of weapons, even without Cook, and none more dangerous than receiver Adam Thielen, who went from honoring Randy Moss with his shoes to posting stats like the Hall of Fame finalist. The Saints are going to have to put serious heat on Keenum, and Marshon Lattimore will have his hands full covering him, assuming that’s how the Saints play it. The receiving corps in Minnesota is a dramatic upgrade from what the Saints faced against the Panthers, plus tight end Kyle Rudolph.  All that being said … Brees is starting his 13th career postseason game, his sixth in the divisional round. Keenum is starting his first, period.   Pick: Saints 30, Vikings 25  MORE PLAYOFF PICKS: Jaguars at Steelers   Vinnie Iyer: Minnesota's run defense shut down New Orleans' rushing offense in Week 1. But that was before Kamara became a big part of the Saints' backfield. The Vikings will feel confident about their defense playing well overall at home, but they will need to win this game with offense.  Kamara, Ingram and Thomas are three difficult entities to contain all at once, especially with Brees playing so well. As the Saints have been a strong finishing team, the Vikings need to be sharp in the red zone.  The Vikings need to be aggressive with Keenum early, looking for big plays to wideouts Thielen and Stefon Diggs, and then turning to Latavius Murray and Kyle Rudolph to close out their own drives.

The Vikings defeated the Saints, 29-24. (Jeff Roberson/Associated Press)   It was a near-unbelievable finish Sunday in Minnesota that sent the bedeviled Vikings past the New Orleans Saints and to the NFC championship game.  The Saints trailed 17-0 at halftime, marking the first time New Orleans had been shut out in a first half since Week 4 of the 2014 season, a road game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Saints managed to fight their way back and even led 21-20 after running back and rookie of the year candidate Alvin Kamara scored on a 14-yard pass. According to ESPN’s win probability, that gave New Orleans a 55 percent chance at winning the game. That would rise to 96 percent after Vikings quarterback Case Keenum, trailing 24-23 threw an incomplete pass with 14 seconds left.     ESPN   Then, the improbable happened: Keenum found Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs in the open field, and instead of Saints safety Marcus Williams wrapping him up, he instead dove for his legs, missing Diggs completely, resulting in a game-winning 61-yard touchdown as time expired.  [ What went wrong for the Saints on Stefon Diggs walk-off touchdown ]    . @STEFONDIGGS FOR THE WIN!!!!!!!!! #SKOL  #NOvsMIN  #NFLPlayoffs  pic.twitter.com/UAoNJ2NJ97 — NFL (@NFL) January 15, 2018     Going from 4 percent to 100 percent win probability is amazing in of itself, but it is more impressive that Keenum and Diggs were not only able to connect on a pass that traveled 27 yards in the air, but tack on 34 yards after the catch for a score. This season, quarterbacks completed just 160 of 570 (28 percent) passes that traveled at least 25 yards past the line of scrimmage. Just 23 of those 160 also saw at least 20 yards after the catch. Even less (20) reached the end zone. Not only did the Vikings overcome incredible odds to win, they did it with a play that failed 28 out of every 29 times it has been tried in 2017.  [ Before NFL success with Vikings, Stefon Diggs was impossible to stop in high school ]  The odds of both happening on the same play? Seventy-one to one, greater than the odds of flipping a coin and having it land on heads six times in a row. But that might be selling the odds short, since it was also the first time in NFL playoff history a team scored a game-winning touchdown with no time remaining in the fourth quarter.    Vikings-Saints was the first game in NFL playoff history to end on a game-winning touchdown as time expired in the fourth quarter @Vikings — NFL Research (@NFLResearch) January 15, 2018     Who knows exactly how unlikely it was that Minnesota won that game, but we are 100 percent sure the Vikings are now just one win away from becoming the first team to play a Super Bowl at home.

If the Falcons upset the Rams on Saturday, and the Panthers upset the Saints on Sunday, Minnesota would face Carolina in next Sunday’s divisional round of the NFC playoffs, instead of Los Angeles or New Orleans.  “To me, personally, I’d want to play the Panthers,” said Kevin Bradley, the SportsBook manager at Bovada.LV. “I just think that the Vikings overall are a better team. The Panthers, yeah, they’ve had some big wins, but to me they can come out very flat sometimes.”  Bradley said the Vikings likely would be favored by about 6.5 points to beat Carolina, but would only be favored to beat the Saints by about four points and the Rams by about three points. He also noted the points spreads are hypothetical, and could change after these weekend’s results, based on potential injuries and how teams look.

Minnesota handled Los Angeles and New Orleans at home. So why is Minnesota’s best match-up against Carolina? Bradley just thinks the Rams, Saints and Vikings are all simply better than the Panthers.  The Vikings get about three points in any match-up from oddsmakers for being the home team, meaning Bradley sees Minnesota as pretty evenly-matched with Los Angeles and New Orleans  “Any of those teams could come out of there,” Bradley said. “There’s a reason it is so close. Whoever (the Vikings) play in their next match-up is not going to be easy. If you look at the other side (in the AFC), there’s some weaker teams potentially. This one, I think it’s pretty wide open.”  Bradley said the entire NFC playoffs are “wide open” this season.  “Even the Eagles, they’ve still been playing well even without (quarterback Carson) Wentz,” Bradley said. “They’re right there. You’ve got the Falcons, who could upset the Rams. To me, it’s really, really tight.”    The reason Bradley thinks the Vikings would be favored by slightly more to beat the Saints than the Rams is he thinks Los Angeles is “marginally” better than New Orleans. Betting patterns, team rankings, stats, match-ups and more play into all spreads.  “Obviously, these (Rams and Saints) teams have really impressed, and if you look at them, they’re kind of the same team,” Bradley said. “They have a good mix of passing and running, both good running games. I would say they’re sort of on par, but I would just say maybe the Rams have a little bit of an edge. I’m also looking at how I would say we would get bet. And, based on our information, I think people would be easier to back the Rams than the Saints.”  VIKINGS NOT GETTING MUCH MONEY   Bovada.LV currently lists the Vikings at 4-1 to win the Super Bowl. That trails only New England, which currently is listed at 5-2.  “We have the Vikings as a favorite (in the NFC), based on the fact that they’re home next week, the Super Bowl is there, all that sort of stuff,” Bradley said. “But right now, even at their low odds, we’re not seeing too much money on them.”  Bradley doesn’t think that’s a signal for a lack of confidence in Minnesota as much as people trying to get a bigger return on investment. A $5 bet on the Vikings to win the Super Bowl would only currently net someone $20.  “I just think it’s because their odds are pretty low,” Bradley said. “I think people missed the boat at the beginning of the year. You could’ve got them around 25-1. That was good. But as the season went on and they kept winning, their odds went down. So right now they’re not really a popular bet, I guess, because people are looking for a bigger payout.”  He has seen far more money lately put on teams such as Atlanta (around 16-1 to win the Super Bowl) and Jacksonville (18-1).  “Teams like that people are more likely to put money on at this point in the season,” Bradley said.

The Vikings are favored by 5.5 points, up two from the opening line. The Over-Under, or total number of points Vegas thinks will be scored, is 46.5, also up two from the opening line. Before you make any kind of pick on this matchup, you have to see who SportsLine stat geek R.J. White is backing. The 2017 NFL season has been extremely profitable if you've been listening to White. He is currently the site's No. 1 NFL expert and finished in the top one percent of the Las Vegas SuperContest -- his second cash in three years in the world's most prestigious handicapping competition. Last season, he finished in the top two percent. He followed that amazing regular season with a 3-1 performance against the spread on Wild Card Weekend and on Saturday, he correctly called the Patriots covering a nearly two-touchdown spread against the Titans. Anyone who has followed his picks is up big-time. Now, he's studied every angle of this battle between the champions of the NFC North and the NFC South and locked in his pick. He's only sharing it over at SportsLine. White knows the Saints have a huge edge when it comes to quarterback experience. This will be Minnesota quarterback Case Keenum's first postseason start, while Drew Brees has started a dozen playoff games and has a winning record that includes a Super Bowl MVP performance. SportsLine's advanced projection model says that Brees will throw for 250 yards and at least one touchdown on Sunday, with Michael Thomas being the best receiving bet to find the end zone. The Saints put together an eight-game winning streak in the middle of the season and won 11 of their last 14 overall before knocking off the Panthers on Wild Card Weekend. They've won three of their last four by double-digits. But just because the Saints have a loaded offense and played well late in the season doesn't mean they'll be able to go on the road and stay within the 5.5-point spread. Minnesota is no fluke as the No. 2 seed in the NFC. The Vikings got there with a dominant defense that was No. 1 in total defense and No. 1 in points allowed. And they were especially stingy at home, giving up just 12.5 points per contest at U.S. Bank Stadium. In their last three games at home, the Vikings allowed a total of 24 points to the Bears, Bengals, and Rams. In between at Lambeau Field, they delivered their first shutout over the Packers since 1971.    The Vikings and Saints met in Week 1, with the Vikings winning 29-19. QB Sam Bradford threw for a dazzling 346 yards and three touchdowns, while Dalvin Cook rushed for a season-high 127. On the other side of the ball, Brees had almost 300 yards passing and a score. Cook tore his ACL in Week 4 and missed the rest of the season, while Bradford was reactivated from IR on Saturday and is expected to back up Case Keenum. SportsLine's model says Keenum will throw for over 200 yards and two touchdowns, while Stefon Diggs has the best chance of any Minnesota pass-catcher of finding the end zone. It also says Vikings RB Latavius Murray, who has three touchdowns in his last three games, scores again. White has evaluated all of the circumstances and has identified a trend that nobody is talking about that has made him confidently back one side. Find out what it is, and who to back, over at SportsLine. So who is White backing on Sunday? Visit SportsLine now to see who you should back and what trend that nobody is talking about will determine the point-spread winner of Saints-Vikings, all from the man who finished in the top one percent of the nation's top handicapping tournament .

Can New Orleans extend that streak to five when it opens its season at Minnesota on Monday night? NFL point spread: The Vikings opened as 3.5-point favorites; the total was 48.5 early in the week, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark. (Line updates and matchup report) NFL betting pick, via OddsShark computer: 23.4-20.2 Vikings (NFL picks on every game)  Why the Saints can cover the spread The Saints started 0-3 last year and never quite recovered. They actually won seven of their next 12 games to make things interesting, before losing their finale to finish 7-9 for the third straight season. New Orleans lost seven games last year by six points or fewer , four by a field goal or less and three games in which it led or was tied for the lead in the fourth quarter. Going into this season the Saints are lined at +400 to win the NFC South (bet $100 to win $400), +2000 to win the NFC and +5000 to win the Super Bowl, with a win over/under total of eight. New Orleans led the NFL in total offense last year with 426.0 yards per game, and while the Saints defense only ranked 17th overall (375.4 YPG) , it came in 14th against the run (101.6 YPG) . With a little improvement on that side of the ball, New Orleans could win a few more of those close games and possibly return to the playoffs.  Why the Vikings can cover the spread The Vikings opened 5-0 last season, with wins over then-defending NFC champion Carolina and four other teams that ended up with winning records. Minnesota then went a bit cold offensively and lost eight of its last 11 games to finish 8-8. But four of those losses came by six points or fewer, including one in overtime, and two came in games the Vikings allowed just 16 and 17 points. Heading into this season Minnesota is getting +325 to win the NFC North, +1600 to win the NFC and +3300 to win the Super Bowl, with an over/under win total of 8.5. The Vikings only ranked 28th in total offense last season at 315.1 yards per game , but third in total defense, holding foes to 314.9 yards per game. With improvement offensively, the Vikings could win not just a couple more games but a division title.  Smart pick In matchups between great offenses and great defenses, the smart money on the Vegas lines usually resides with the defense. But not only did the Saints lead the league in yardage last year, they've added former Minnesota great Adrian Peterson . How much AP still has in the tank is uncertain, but emotion might elevate his game going against his former team in his former home. The smart play here is New Orleans.  NFL betting trends The Saints are 2-6 ATS in their last eight games against the Vikings. The total has gone over in six of the Saints' last eight games against the Vikings. The Vikings are 6-1 ATS in their last seven games at night.  All NFL odds and betting trends courtesy of Bleacher Report's official odds partner, OddsShark.

By  OddsShark    Jan 12, 2018,  8:00am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Saints vs. Vikings 2018 odds: New Orleans an underdog at Minnesota for Sunday      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports     The New Orleans Saints are 0-3 straight up and against the spread over their last three road games. After advancing to the divisional round with a win at home, the Saints will now be tasked with breaking their road losing streak this Sunday when they visit the Minnesota Vikings .  New Orleans is a 5-point road underdog in Minneapolis at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com. The betting underdog is just 3-16 SU in the last 19 NFL divisional games.   New Orleans Saints at Minnesota Vikings  When: Sunday, January 14, 4:40 p.m. ET  Where: U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, Minnesota  Betting Line / Total: Minnesota -5 / 46.5 Points  Saints at Vikings OddsShark Matchup Report   New Orleans Saints  Drew Brees put together a strong performance last Sunday against one of the league’s top defenses racking up 376 passing yards and two passing touchdowns while leading the Saints to a 31-26 victory over the Carolina Panthers.  The defense did its part too, fending off a potential game-winning drive for the Panthers with a late stand to preserve the lead. New Orleans won but failed to cover as 6.5-point favorites, falling to 2-6 ATS over their last eight games since going 6-1 ATS over their previous seven.  The Saints are just 1-6 SU and 2-5 ATS in their last seven postseason road games per the OddsShark NFL Database .   Minnesota Vikings  Minnesota stumbled out of the gate to a 2-2 SU and ATS record in 2017, but from that point forward emerged as one of the NFL’s most dominant teams.  The Vikings earned a first-round bye with an 11-1 SU and 9-3 ATS record over their last 12 games, finishing the year with the league’s best defense in both total yards (275.9) and points (15.8) allowed per game.  In addition to the team’s outstanding year on defense, the Vikings also got a breakout performance from third-string quarterback Case Keenum under center, who threw for 3,547 yards and 22 touchdowns. Minnesota, the second favorite on the updated odds to win Super Bowl 52 , is 7-2 ATS in its last nine games against New Orleans.  Sunday’s total is set at 46.5 points. The OVER is 7-2 in the last nine games between these two teams.  New Orleans ranked second in the NFL in total offense and fourth in scoring offense this season. The team with the elite defense tends to hold the edge in these offense vs. defense showdowns, but five points may be a difficult spread to cover against a Saints offense led by one of the game’s all-time great quarterbacks.

Adam  Thompson      @_Adam_Thompson_   Aug 29, 2:28PM EDT                            NEW ORLEANS SAINTS AT MINNESOTA VIKINGS (-3.5, O/U 48), Mon., 7:10 p.m. ET  The NFL scheduling committee must have some sense of humor, as Adrian Peterson, who ran over defenders for the Vikings for 10 seasons, returns to Minnesota for his first game since leaving via free agency.                    EXCLUSIVE TO SPORTSLINE PRO MEMBERS     Mon 09/11 7:10 PM EDT    New Orleans  +155  O/U 47.5    @ Minnesota  -175  -3       B      C      C        NO       MIN     VIEW FULL GAME ANALYSIS       LINE MOVEMENT, TRENDS  It?s one of the few games in which the line hasn't moved since it opened in April.  The Saints have covered in nine of their last 10 road games. Conversely, the Vikings have failed to cover in nine of their last 10 Monday night appearances.  Including playoffs, this is the fifth time since 2010 the teams have matched up; New Orleans has won the last four.  BREAKDOWN  The Vikings know what New Orleans? offense wants to do; they just need to stop it. Right?  Easier said than done.  Drew Brees ranked No. 1 in yards (5,208) and third in TDs (37) last year. The 38-year-old remains one of the formidable QBs in the league .   The team is without his top target from a year ago, Brandin Cooks. When WR Michael Thomas was the intended receiver, Brees? QB rating was a solid sixth. Speedster Ted Ginn was signed via free agency, though he was fifth in the league in drops with Carolina last year.  The Vikings have one of the more readymade defenses to handle Brees and Co. They ranked third in the NFL in pass defense last season, and Terence Newman (No. 2) and Xavier Rhodes (No. 10) were two of the NFL's best corners in pass coverage, per Pro Football Focus.  Minnesota wasn?t easy on backs, either, with top-10 run-stoppers at each level: Linval Joseph (No. 10 DT), Craig Robertson (No. 5 LB) and Harrison Smith (No. 6 safety). They?ll be ready for Peterson, who rushed six times for 15 yards in the Saints' third preseason game.  The Saints? defense was dead last against the pass last season; only the 49ers allowed more points.  But to its credit, New Orleans addressed glaring issues with the free-agent signings of LBs A.J. Klein and Manti T?eo and DT Nick Fairley, and the first-round selection of Ohio State CB Marshon Lattimore.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Sean Gardner/Getty Images      The Divisional Round of the 2018 NFL Playoffs concludes with an NFC showdown between the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints. Minnesota is coming off a bye and hoping to move one step closer to becoming the first team to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium, while the Saints will try to keep their momentum going after taking care of business against the NFC South rival Carolina Panthers during the Wild Card round. It’s an intriguing matchup that could be one of the best of the weekend if it lives up to the hype. The Philadelphia Eagles await the victor in the NFC Championship, a game in which today's winner will almost certainly be favored on the road against the conference's No. 1 seed:   Lookahead NFC Championship lines from BetOnline:  Eagles +4.5 vs Vikings Eagles +2.5 vs Saints  — OddsShark (@OddsShark) January 14, 2018   Oddsmakers have installed the Vikings as five-point chalk in this one, a seemingly fair line given how the Vikings thoroughly dismantled this opponent a few months ago at U.S. Bank Stadium. These foes previously met in the 2017 season-opener, a 29-19 Minnesota victory in which the offense gashed New Orleans’ defense for 470 total yards. The Saints would give up another 555 yards and 36 points to the New England Patriots in Week 2 before shoring up defensively and ripping off an eight-game winning streak that propelled them to a divisional crown and No. 4 seed in the conference.    The Vikings have also changed drastically since the opener, handing the keys of the offense over to Case Keenum after starter Sam Bradford went down with injury in Week 2. It’s been a brilliant decision thus far, as Minnesota’s offense came alive this year after ranking near the bottom of the league in 2016, pairing with a dominant defense to earn the NFC North title and the NFC’s No. 2 seed.  Will the Vikings live up to expectations and vanquish the Saints for the second time this season, or will New Orleans find a way to pick up a playoff “W” away from the Superdome—an issue the club has struggled with in the past, winning just one of seven road postseason contests in franchise history—on Sunday afternoon? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has sent along his analysis to go along with a winning pick against the spread.

New Orleans has faced Minnesota more than any other opponent it currently or has ever shared a division with. That isn’t a positive thing for the organization, as the Vikings hold a commanding lead in the all-time series, winning 21 of the 32 total contests—which includes a 2-1 postseason record—between the teams. Minnesota has been especially proficient at home against this foe, beating New Orleans 13 times in 16 tries. The Saints did come up with a big victory during their last playoff trip to the Twin Cities, however, winning an epic 2010 NFC Championship Game in overtime on their way to the first ever Super Bowl title for the franchise.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Hannah Foslien/Getty Images      The 2018 NFC Championship Game will feature the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings, the conference’s top two seeds. These teams capitalized on their Wild Card bye week, coming out fresh and winning in the Divisional Round. Not many expected either club to be competing Super Bowl this year, but both vastly exceeded expectations during the 2017 campaign and made a run to the NFL’s final four.  Despite being the No. 1 seed and having home field advantage, Philadelphia opened at most Vegas shops as a slight, three-point underdog to the Vikings. The Eagles will use this line as more bulletin board material, as getting points at home against the Atlanta Falcons fueled their 15-10 win against the No. 6 seed on Saturday.  Minnesota deserved the right to be favored, however, after edging past the high-powered New Orleans Saints, 29-24, on Sunday evening. The defense kept a Saints offense that averaged 28 points per game during the regular season to zero first half points and then survived a three-touchdown onslaught from future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees. The Vikings lost the lead after a New Orleans field goal with only a few minutes left, but won on an incredible, 61-yard, desperation walk-off touchdown connection from signal-caller Case Keenum to wideout Stefon Diggs. The Saints badly blew the coverage on the heave and missed a tackle that would have ended the game in their favor, opening the door for Minnesota to win its first ever Super Bowl.    NFL Stats showcased this incredible play:   The #Vikings beat the #Saints with a walk-off TD by Stefon Diggs.  They will play the Eagles next week in the NFC Championship game! pic.twitter.com/tY4UJnNk21  — NFL Stats (@NFL_Stats) January 15, 2018   It was an impressive feat and now the Vikings are one game closer to being the first organization to ever partake in a Super Bowl hosted in their home stadium. Before they can do that, they’ll need to escape Philly with a victory, something only one team has done this year. Here’s a look at the complete schedule, start time, TV info, opening line and more for both conference championship games:   2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide  Odds updated 1/19 at 11 a.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39.5      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook    The Eagles haven’t exactly thrived offensively since Nick Foles took over under center for the injured Carson Wentz, but that hasn’t stopped the club from winning. Foles is 3-1 as a starter, with his only loss coming in a meaningless regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys. The sixth-year man out of Arizona has only thrown for one touchdown in the three games since torching a shameful New York Giants defense for 237 yards and four scores in Week 15. Philadelphia’s offense has averaged a mere 11.3 points in that span, but the defense has picked up the slack when it matters most.  Atlanta came into the Divisional Round on the back of a convincing 26-13 road victory versus the Los Angeles Rams, but the Dirty Birds offense stalled out in the City of Brotherly Love. The Falcons generated only 281 yards and 10 points on Saturday, their lowest totals in both categories since a 14-9 loss to Minnesota in Week 13. Philadelphia’s best chance to win was keeping the Falcons from scoring more than a couple of touchdowns—Atlanta lost every game (0-7 including the playoffs) that it failed to reach 20 points—and dominate time of possession (the Eagles held the ball for over 32 minutes), two things it accomplished in the low-scoring affair. Those keys to victory will not change this week against the Vikings in the NFC Championship.  Eagles head coach Doug Pederson said that his players are sick of hearing that they aren't good enough to win in the playoffs and being made underdogs by the sportsbooks, as per ESPN :   When did Carson Wentz go down? Since that point, no one's given us a chance. I understand Carson's a great player, but every week our guys are hearing the same thing. Now, all of a sudden, we're not good enough? We're 13-3, best record in football, home-field advantage throughout. The guys are gonna motivate themselves based on what they've heard for the last month.

Here are our picks and predictions for the divisional-round game in Minneapolis.                   David Steele      @david_c_steele          Published on Jan. 14, 2018    Jan. 14, 2018           Watch NFL NFL with fuboTV    The Saints and Vikings met on the first Monday night of the season in Minneapolis … and will meet again in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.  However, there will be no Sam Bradford (except in emergency), no Dalvin Cook and no Adrian Peterson memorably scowling at Sean Payton. How quaint that was, worrying about how the 32-year-old future Hall of Famer would fit in.   MORE: Stream Saints-Vikings live and on-demand with fuboTV (7-day free trial)  Somehow the Saints turned Peterson into a footnote, and the Vikings did the same with Bradford, the quarterback they traded a first-round pick to get a year earlier. The Vikings won that night, 29-19, and managed to get better even without Bradford and Cook. The Saints’ three-man backfield has since turned into a two-headed monster of Mark Ingram and breakout rookie Alvin Kamara.  The Vikings have gotten a special season out of Case Keenum, worked around Cook's injury, unleashed another rugged version of Mike Zimmer’s defense, and threatened to make the NFC go through Minneapolis to get to the Super Bowl (in Minneapolis). And the Saints still have Drew Brees, who reminded everyone of who he is when needed in the wild-card win over the Panthers.  Enjoy the rematch between better versions of these teams, playing for much higher stakes.  NFL playoff picks: Saints at Vikings (-4)    Date, time: Sunday, 4:40 p.m. ET   Location: U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis   TV: FOX   Live streaming: FuboTV (free trial)   Odds: Vikings -4; total: 45.5    David Steele: Cut to the chase. The Saints of Brees, Ingram, Kamara, Michael Thomas lead the fourth-highest scoring offense in the NFL (and second in yards). They face off against the Vikings’ defense, giving up the fewest points and yards in the league and starting two first-team All-Pros in the secondary (Xavier Rhodes, Harrison Smith), and two other Pro Bowlers on the unit (Everson Griffen, Anthony Barr). The most fun will be when the Saints have the ball.  The most worrisome time for the Saints is when they don’t have it. Keenum had plenty of weapons, even without Cook, and none more dangerous than receiver Adam Thielen, who went from honoring Randy Moss with his shoes to posting stats like the Hall of Fame finalist. The Saints are going to have to put serious heat on Keenum, and Marshon Lattimore will have his hands full covering him, assuming that’s how the Saints play it. The receiving corps in Minnesota is a dramatic upgrade from what the Saints faced against the Panthers, plus tight end Kyle Rudolph.  All that being said … Brees is starting his 13th career postseason game, his sixth in the divisional round. Keenum is starting his first, period.   Pick: Saints 30, Vikings 25  MORE PLAYOFF PICKS: Jaguars at Steelers   Vinnie Iyer: Minnesota's run defense shut down New Orleans' rushing offense in Week 1. But that was before Kamara became a big part of the Saints' backfield. The Vikings will feel confident about their defense playing well overall at home, but they will need to win this game with offense.  Kamara, Ingram and Thomas are three difficult entities to contain all at once, especially with Brees playing so well. As the Saints have been a strong finishing team, the Vikings need to be sharp in the red zone.  The Vikings need to be aggressive with Keenum early, looking for big plays to wideouts Thielen and Stefon Diggs, and then turning to Latavius Murray and Kyle Rudolph to close out their own drives.

The Vikings defeated the Saints, 29-24. (Jeff Roberson/Associated Press)   It was a near-unbelievable finish Sunday in Minnesota that sent the bedeviled Vikings past the New Orleans Saints and to the NFC championship game.  The Saints trailed 17-0 at halftime, marking the first time New Orleans had been shut out in a first half since Week 4 of the 2014 season, a road game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Saints managed to fight their way back and even led 21-20 after running back and rookie of the year candidate Alvin Kamara scored on a 14-yard pass. According to ESPN’s win probability, that gave New Orleans a 55 percent chance at winning the game. That would rise to 96 percent after Vikings quarterback Case Keenum, trailing 24-23 threw an incomplete pass with 14 seconds left.     ESPN   Then, the improbable happened: Keenum found Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs in the open field, and instead of Saints safety Marcus Williams wrapping him up, he instead dove for his legs, missing Diggs completely, resulting in a game-winning 61-yard touchdown as time expired.  [ What went wrong for the Saints on Stefon Diggs walk-off touchdown ]    . @STEFONDIGGS FOR THE WIN!!!!!!!!! #SKOL  #NOvsMIN  #NFLPlayoffs  pic.twitter.com/UAoNJ2NJ97 — NFL (@NFL) January 15, 2018     Going from 4 percent to 100 percent win probability is amazing in of itself, but it is more impressive that Keenum and Diggs were not only able to connect on a pass that traveled 27 yards in the air, but tack on 34 yards after the catch for a score. This season, quarterbacks completed just 160 of 570 (28 percent) passes that traveled at least 25 yards past the line of scrimmage. Just 23 of those 160 also saw at least 20 yards after the catch. Even less (20) reached the end zone. Not only did the Vikings overcome incredible odds to win, they did it with a play that failed 28 out of every 29 times it has been tried in 2017.  [ Before NFL success with Vikings, Stefon Diggs was impossible to stop in high school ]  The odds of both happening on the same play? Seventy-one to one, greater than the odds of flipping a coin and having it land on heads six times in a row. But that might be selling the odds short, since it was also the first time in NFL playoff history a team scored a game-winning touchdown with no time remaining in the fourth quarter.    Vikings-Saints was the first game in NFL playoff history to end on a game-winning touchdown as time expired in the fourth quarter @Vikings — NFL Research (@NFLResearch) January 15, 2018     Who knows exactly how unlikely it was that Minnesota won that game, but we are 100 percent sure the Vikings are now just one win away from becoming the first team to play a Super Bowl at home.

If the Falcons upset the Rams on Saturday, and the Panthers upset the Saints on Sunday, Minnesota would face Carolina in next Sunday’s divisional round of the NFC playoffs, instead of Los Angeles or New Orleans.  “To me, personally, I’d want to play the Panthers,” said Kevin Bradley, the SportsBook manager at Bovada.LV. “I just think that the Vikings overall are a better team. The Panthers, yeah, they’ve had some big wins, but to me they can come out very flat sometimes.”  Bradley said the Vikings likely would be favored by about 6.5 points to beat Carolina, but would only be favored to beat the Saints by about four points and the Rams by about three points. He also noted the points spreads are hypothetical, and could change after these weekend’s results, based on potential injuries and how teams look.

Minnesota handled Los Angeles and New Orleans at home. So why is Minnesota’s best match-up against Carolina? Bradley just thinks the Rams, Saints and Vikings are all simply better than the Panthers.  The Vikings get about three points in any match-up from oddsmakers for being the home team, meaning Bradley sees Minnesota as pretty evenly-matched with Los Angeles and New Orleans  “Any of those teams could come out of there,” Bradley said. “There’s a reason it is so close. Whoever (the Vikings) play in their next match-up is not going to be easy. If you look at the other side (in the AFC), there’s some weaker teams potentially. This one, I think it’s pretty wide open.”  Bradley said the entire NFC playoffs are “wide open” this season.  “Even the Eagles, they’ve still been playing well even without (quarterback Carson) Wentz,” Bradley said. “They’re right there. You’ve got the Falcons, who could upset the Rams. To me, it’s really, really tight.”    The reason Bradley thinks the Vikings would be favored by slightly more to beat the Saints than the Rams is he thinks Los Angeles is “marginally” better than New Orleans. Betting patterns, team rankings, stats, match-ups and more play into all spreads.  “Obviously, these (Rams and Saints) teams have really impressed, and if you look at them, they’re kind of the same team,” Bradley said. “They have a good mix of passing and running, both good running games. I would say they’re sort of on par, but I would just say maybe the Rams have a little bit of an edge. I’m also looking at how I would say we would get bet. And, based on our information, I think people would be easier to back the Rams than the Saints.”  VIKINGS NOT GETTING MUCH MONEY   Bovada.LV currently lists the Vikings at 4-1 to win the Super Bowl. That trails only New England, which currently is listed at 5-2.  “We have the Vikings as a favorite (in the NFC), based on the fact that they’re home next week, the Super Bowl is there, all that sort of stuff,” Bradley said. “But right now, even at their low odds, we’re not seeing too much money on them.”  Bradley doesn’t think that’s a signal for a lack of confidence in Minnesota as much as people trying to get a bigger return on investment. A $5 bet on the Vikings to win the Super Bowl would only currently net someone $20.  “I just think it’s because their odds are pretty low,” Bradley said. “I think people missed the boat at the beginning of the year. You could’ve got them around 25-1. That was good. But as the season went on and they kept winning, their odds went down. So right now they’re not really a popular bet, I guess, because people are looking for a bigger payout.”  He has seen far more money lately put on teams such as Atlanta (around 16-1 to win the Super Bowl) and Jacksonville (18-1).  “Teams like that people are more likely to put money on at this point in the season,” Bradley said.
