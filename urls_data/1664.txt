What is the probability that it is either a spade or an Ace or both?” Answer: probability of an ace is 4/52 probability of a spade is 13/52 probabaility of both (As) is 1/52 Since your asking for any of the three possibilities, using the “or” logical operator, you can add together the odds for either an ace or a spade while remembering to not double count the cards that fit into more than one group, i.e. the As is both an ace and a spade so: 4 Aces + 13 spades - 1 Ace of spades (due to being counted twice) (4+13–1)/52 =16/52 = 4/13 11.9k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

It is divided into 4 suits namely clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades, divided equally among all that is 13 each. Ace consists of one each diamond, spade, club and hearts. Number of spade cards = 13 Number of ace cards = 4 But we have already chosen 1 ace card in the 13 spade cards. Therefor, P{spade or ace} = (13 + 4 - 1)/52 16/52 = 4/13 is the probablity.

Undo   Manjunath Subramanya Iyer , I am a retired bank officer teaching maths Answered Mar 24, 2018 · Author has 1.5k answers and 75.4k answer views Probability of an event = Number of outcomes favourable to that event/ Number of all possible outcomes. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample and is denoted by S. A deck of cards has 52 cards. If one card is randomly selected irrespective of any condition then we have 52 ways in selecting it. Therefore number of all possible outcomes denoted by n(S) = 52. But we want the desired event E in which either a spade or an ace or both is selected. There are 13 spades + 4 aces in a deck of cards. Since the ace of spades appears in both, we have 13+4–1 = 16 choices. So n(E) = 16 ways. Hence the probability of selecting a spade or an ace or both is = 16/52 = 4/13 168 Views   Jatin Mukheja , Associate Project Manager at GradeUp Answered Mar 17, 2015 · Author has 54 answers and 135.7k answer views In a deck of cards,there are 13 spade,4 ace cards out of total 52 cards. but out of these 13 spade cards,1 is ace already,so total favourable cards for us are 13+4-1=16. so probability=16/52 =4/13 38.9k Views · View Upvoters   Larry Denburg , Professional magician.

A counting challenge from Science Buddies By Science Buddies on September 27, 2012 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: George Retseck Advertisement   Key concepts Mathematics Probability Chance Strategy Cards   Introduction Have you ever been playing cards and wished you could use psychic powers to draw the card you wanted? You may not be psychic, but you can still have the power of probability on your side. In this activity you'll investigate the probabilities of drawing specific types of cards from a deck. You'll discover how math can help you avoid the dreaded phrase, "Go fish!"   Background When you draw a card from a deck, you have a certain chance of getting a specific type of card, such as a spade or face card, or one particular card, such as the queen of hearts. Consider the game "Go Fish" with a regular card deck. The goal is to get the most four-of-a-kind sets by asking your opponent for matching cards or by drawing them from the deck. To win, you can rely on chance or you can increase your probability of getting matching cards, but how?  By understanding how chance is related to math, you can play with a winning strategy. For example, if you have three kings and one queen in your hand and it's your turn to ask for a card, which one should you ask your opponent for? You might think you should ask for a king, but it's actually better to take a queen! Why? Because you have a better chance of getting it. There are four kings and four queens in the deck, and with three kings and one queen in your hand, there's one king and three queens left. This gives you only one chance to get a king, but three chances to get a queen out of the remaining cards.   Materials •     Standard deck of playing cards •     Piece of paper •     Pencil or pen •     Calculator   Preparation •     Count the cards in the deck and make sure it is complete. (There should be 54 cards total.) Take out the two jokers. Shuffle the deck three times and set aside. •     Pick four types of cards to investigate, such as a color, suit, number or face card, and a specific one. For example, you could investigate red cards, spades, kings and the queen of hearts. •     Draw a table to in which to record your data. Make a column for each card type you'll investigate. In the first row write how many of that type of card are in the deck. For example, there are 26 red cards in a deck, 13 spades, four kings and one queen of hearts. Make 10 rows below this one for the 10 trials you will be doing.   Procedure •     Decide which type of card you will investigate first. Draw cards from the top of the deck and flip them over one at a time, counting as you go, and stop when you see that type of card. How many cards did you draw until you reached that card? Write down the answer in your table. •     Shuffle the deck again and repeat this process, flipping over the cards and looking for the same type of card. How many cards did it take this time? Write down the answer in your table. Repeat this for a total of 10 times for one type of card. •     Repeat this process for each of the four types of cards you picked to investigate. This means that you will have looked for each type of card a total of 10 times. •     Calculate the average number of cards you drew to reach each type of card. Label the last row in your table "Averages" and write them in this row. • Which types of cards were the easiest to draw? Which were the most difficult? How do you think the chances of drawing a card relate to the total number of that card type in the deck? • Based on what you saw in this activity, how do you think probability can help you choose the right strategy in a card game? • Extra: A more advanced way of showing the results of your experiment would be to make histograms, which are a type of graph to show distributions. Try making a separate histogram for each type of card you tested by graphing the number of cards drawn for each trial separately in a bar graph. When all of the bars are lined up next to each other, what does the overall shape of the distribution look like? • Extra: The probability of drawing a particular type of card also depends on the number of cards drawn each time. Try doing this activity again but draw samples of three, five or seven cards at a time. Do your chances improve as more cards are taken? • Extra: Probabilities can change your strategies for playing a card game. Can you design an experiment to show how probabilities can help you choose cards and win "Go Fish"? What about other popular card games? Can you invent your own game based on probabilities?   Observations and results Did it take fewer draws to reach a certain color than it took to reach a certain suit or kind of card? Did it take even more draws to reach a specific card?  Mathematicians measure probability by counting and using some very basic math, like addition and division. For example, you can add up the number of spades in a complete deck (13) and divide this by the total number of cards in the deck (52) to get the probability of randomly drawing a spade: 13 in 52, or 25 percent. If you were investigating red cards, kings or the queen of hearts, the odds of randomly drawing one of these from a complete deck are 50 percent (26 in 52); about 7.7 percent (four in 52); or about 1.9 percent (one in 52), respectively. This is why, on average (when done over enough trials), it is easier to draw a red card than a spade, a spade than a king, and a king than the queen of hearts. As you draw cards from a deck, the odds of finding your card change. For example, if you are looking for a spade and do not get it on your first draw, there are still 13 spades in the deck but the deck now holds only 51 cards, so your odds of drawing a spade on the second draw are 13 in 51, or about 25.5 percent. This may not seem like much of an improvement, but with every draw the odds continue to increase.

What's the probability that it is neither a spade ($\spadesuit$) or jack?   I got $$\frac{12}{52}\cdot \frac{4}{52}=\frac{48}{2704}=1.78\%$$ Did I do this right?    probability  proof-verification     share | cite | improve this question      edited Oct 1 '15 at 0:42       Winther   19.5k 3 27 52        asked Sep 30 '15 at 19:48       Devin Toadvine   1 2              1      No, very far from the truth.  You will be happy if the card is neither a spade nor a Jack. How many cards will make you happy?  Lots. If you do not know an efficient way of counting, do it inefficiently. – André Nicolas  Sep 30 '15 at 19:52             work with complements of sets [neither $A$ nor $B$] $\Leftrightarrow$ [not (<$A$ and not $B$> or <$A$ and $B$> or <not $A$ and $B$>) ] – Max  Sep 30 '15 at 19:56         1      It would have been much better if you had explained your thought process instead of just writing down a more or less random formula. – mrf  Sep 30 '15 at 20:30            Do you even know the compound inequality that every probability must satisfy? Obviously not. – Benedict Voltaire  Sep 30 '15 at 21:05        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote      No.  If your first fraction had been $13/52$, that would have been the probability that the card was both a spade and a jack, but that would have been much easier obtained as the probability of drawing the jack of spades: $1/52$.  In point of fact, the probability you ended up with, $3/169$, is less than the probability of drawing any individual card, so it cannot be correct.  One good way of arriving at the correct result is to think of how many cards are neither a jack nor a spade.  Of the $52$ cards, $52-13 = 39$ are not spades; but of those, $3$ are jacks, leaving $36$.  So the desired probability is $36/52 = 9/13$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 30 '15 at 19:54       Brian Tung   23.3k 2 23 49              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      There are $4$ jacks in the deck and $13$ spades. However $1$ jack is a spade so we have a total of $16$ cards which are either a jack or a spade. Therefore there are $52-16=36$ cards which are not a jack or a spade. Thus the probability is $36/52$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 30 '15 at 19:52       Ben   499 2 10                  Why am I not multiplying them separately? – Devin Toadvine  Sep 30 '15 at 19:59            For this question, the probability is (#number of cards not a spade or a Jack) / (#number of cards). We know the number of cards is 52, and its easy to calculate how many cards are not a spade or a jack so calculating the probability is easy. – Ben  Sep 30 '15 at 20:02         add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

The order of spades, hearts and aces isn't relevant. These are exchangeable events. For instance the probability that card 1 is an ace, card 2 a heart and card 3 a spade is the same as the probability requested here. – Lord Shark the Unknown  Apr 30 '17 at 6:36        1      Add to @LordSharktheUnknown's reply, the order has the effect on $n(\Omega)$. – Rajat  Apr 30 '17 at 9:58        add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      $$P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(\Omega)}$$
Here, $$n(A) = n(\text{ace of spade}) \times n(\text{ace of heart}) \times n(\text{other aces}) + \\ n(\text{spade other than ace}) \times n(\text{ace of heart}) \times n(\text{other aces}) + \\ n(\text{ace of spade}) \times n(\text{ heart other than ace}) \times n(\text{other aces}) + \\ n(\text{spade other than ace}) \times n(\text{ heart other than ace}) \times n(\text{aces})$$
$$=1 \times 1 \times 2+ 2 \times 12 \times 1 \times 3 + 12 \times 12 \times 4$$
$$ = 2+72+576=650$$  $$n(\Omega)= 52 \times 51 \times 50 $$

$$\frac{12\times13}{51\times 50}\times\frac2{52}.$$
The probability of drawing a spade followed by a heart followed by the ace of diamonds or clubs is is
$$\frac{13^2}{51\times 50}\times\frac2{52}.$$
These add to

I was thinking that we'd do $\frac{13}{52} \cdot (\frac{4}{51} + \frac{3}{51})$, since the first card could have been an ace. Is this correct?    probability  combinatorics  card-games     share | cite | improve this question     asked Aug 14 '17 at 17:46       Tiwa Aina   2,243 2 16                  No, that is not correct. The (wrong) formula $$\frac{13}{52}\cdot \frac{4}{51}$$ is wrong because it over-caclulates the probability, since it gives more cases of the second card being an ace. But your answer is greater than this wrong formula, so it is necessarily wrong, too. – Thomas Andrews  Aug 14 '17 at 17:49        add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      An alternate approach is that the first card is a spade with probability $\frac{13}{52}.$ Of those case, $\frac{1}{13}$ was the spade ace, and $\frac{12}{13}$ were not the ace. So the probability is:  $$\frac{13}{52}\left(\frac{1}{13}\cdot\frac{3}{51}+\frac{12}{13}\cdot\frac{4}{51}\right)$$  If $X$ is the even that the first card is a spade ace and $Y$ is the event that the first card is another spade we get, and $Z$ is the event that the second card is an ace, this formula is:  $$P((X\lor Y)\land Z)=P(X\lor Y)\left(P(X\mid X\lor Y)P(Z\mid X)+P(Y\mid X\lor Y)P(Z\mid Y)\right)$$  This is true in general if $X$ and $Y$ are disjoint events.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Aug 14 '17 at 18:04             answered Aug 14 '17 at 17:54       Thomas Andrews   126k 10 140 278                  I knew it could have been done using distributive multiplication! Thanks. – Tiwa Aina  Aug 14 '17 at 17:59        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      So the probability that the first card is a non-ace spade is $12/52$, and the probability that we pull an ace after that is $4/51$. On the other hand, the probability that we draw the ace of spades is $1/52$, and the chance of pulling another ace is $3/51$. All together we have  $$\frac{12}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51}+\frac{1}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 14 '17 at 17:49       Elliot G   9,097 2 13 42                  Ohh, that makes sense. How do I improve on these types of probability questions? Would this be categorized as casework probability? – Tiwa Aina  Aug 14 '17 at 17:53            When possible, I like to draw (or imagine) a tree diagram. That way it becomes more obvious when you've said something nonsensical. In this case, you double counted cases like drawing two ace of spades. – Elliot G  Aug 14 '17 at 17:56        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Another way to see this is to note that the events (1st card is Spade) and (2nd card is Ace) are independent because knowledge of the suit of the first card can't affect the probability of an Ace on the second card. Then  $P$(1st Spade and 2nd Ace) = $P$(1st Spade)$P$(2nd Ace) = (1/4)(1/13) = 1/52  which of course is the same as the solutions given above.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 14 '17 at 23:38       Ned   1,622 8 9                  the solutions above give 1/51, not 1/52.

But this is the same each time since you draw with replacement. Therefore, since each event is independent, you can multiply the probabilities:
$$P(S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4) = P(S_1)P(S_2)P(S_3)P(S_4) = \left(\frac{13}{52}\right)^4,$$
where $S_i = \text{Spade on draw $i$}$, for $i = 1,2,3,4$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 17 '15 at 0:33             answered Dec 17 '15 at 0:21       Max   14.8k 7 19 35              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Yes this is a typical 'AND' problem where you multiply probabilities.

We could have 10,9,8 of spades but we will need either another spade or another of the same group the draw to be successful.  My approach was following - Success scenarios:   Spade and Middle Card - 13/52*10/51  Spade and Middle Spade 10/52*3/51  Middle and Middle Spade 9/52*3/51  Middle Spade and Middle Spade 3/52*2/51   But this is for drawing 2 cards, how shall I input the third card drawing possibility into this?    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question     asked Feb 27 '15 at 12:39       SKYTTEN   58 7              add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      In this case I find it a little easier to calculate the probability of failing to get what you want; then you can subtract that from $1$ to get the desired probability. You fail if you draw no spade or no middle card. There are $\binom{39}3$ ways to draw three non-spades, and there are $\binom{40}3$ ways to draw no middle card. However, some sets of three cards have been counted twice, because they contain neither a spade nor a middle card. There are $13$ spades and $9$ non-spade middle cards, so there are $30$ cards that are neither spades nor middle cards and therefore $\binom{30}3$ sets of three cards that are ‘bad’ in both ways. Altogether, then, there are  $$\binom{39}3+\binom{40}3-\binom{30}3$$  bad draws out of the total of $\binom{52}3$ possible draws, and the desired probability is  $$1-\frac{\binom{39}3+\binom{40}3-\binom{30}3}{\binom{52}3}\;,$$  which is a little less than $\frac13$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 27 '15 at 21:15       Brian M.

Still, I couldn't get my head around the problem where I had intersection between the sets. Could you please explain more about the third number in the equation (30,3). Still cannot figure out how to arrive to that thought of subtracting this number. Is that because we counted some cards twice and this subtraction takes care of that excess? – SKYTTEN  Feb 28 '15 at 9:28             @SKYTTEN: You're welcome. Yes, it is. Every set of three cards that contains no spades and no middle cards is counted once in the $\binom{39}3$ and once again in the $\binom{40}3$. There are $\binom{30}3$ such sets, and every one of them has been counted twice in the sum $\binom{39}3+\binom{40}3$. In order to compensate, we must subtract $1$ for each of those sets that we've counted twice. This means subtracting $\binom{30}3$. – Brian M.

A counting challenge from Science Buddies By Science Buddies on September 27, 2012 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: George Retseck Advertisement   Key concepts Mathematics Probability Chance Strategy Cards   Introduction Have you ever been playing cards and wished you could use psychic powers to draw the card you wanted? You may not be psychic, but you can still have the power of probability on your side. In this activity you'll investigate the probabilities of drawing specific types of cards from a deck. You'll discover how math can help you avoid the dreaded phrase, "Go fish!"   Background When you draw a card from a deck, you have a certain chance of getting a specific type of card, such as a spade or face card, or one particular card, such as the queen of hearts. Consider the game "Go Fish" with a regular card deck. The goal is to get the most four-of-a-kind sets by asking your opponent for matching cards or by drawing them from the deck. To win, you can rely on chance or you can increase your probability of getting matching cards, but how?  By understanding how chance is related to math, you can play with a winning strategy. For example, if you have three kings and one queen in your hand and it's your turn to ask for a card, which one should you ask your opponent for? You might think you should ask for a king, but it's actually better to take a queen! Why? Because you have a better chance of getting it. There are four kings and four queens in the deck, and with three kings and one queen in your hand, there's one king and three queens left. This gives you only one chance to get a king, but three chances to get a queen out of the remaining cards.   Materials •     Standard deck of playing cards •     Piece of paper •     Pencil or pen •     Calculator   Preparation •     Count the cards in the deck and make sure it is complete. (There should be 54 cards total.) Take out the two jokers. Shuffle the deck three times and set aside. •     Pick four types of cards to investigate, such as a color, suit, number or face card, and a specific one. For example, you could investigate red cards, spades, kings and the queen of hearts. •     Draw a table to in which to record your data. Make a column for each card type you'll investigate. In the first row write how many of that type of card are in the deck. For example, there are 26 red cards in a deck, 13 spades, four kings and one queen of hearts. Make 10 rows below this one for the 10 trials you will be doing.   Procedure •     Decide which type of card you will investigate first. Draw cards from the top of the deck and flip them over one at a time, counting as you go, and stop when you see that type of card. How many cards did you draw until you reached that card? Write down the answer in your table. •     Shuffle the deck again and repeat this process, flipping over the cards and looking for the same type of card. How many cards did it take this time? Write down the answer in your table. Repeat this for a total of 10 times for one type of card. •     Repeat this process for each of the four types of cards you picked to investigate. This means that you will have looked for each type of card a total of 10 times. •     Calculate the average number of cards you drew to reach each type of card. Label the last row in your table "Averages" and write them in this row. • Which types of cards were the easiest to draw? Which were the most difficult? How do you think the chances of drawing a card relate to the total number of that card type in the deck? • Based on what you saw in this activity, how do you think probability can help you choose the right strategy in a card game? • Extra: A more advanced way of showing the results of your experiment would be to make histograms, which are a type of graph to show distributions. Try making a separate histogram for each type of card you tested by graphing the number of cards drawn for each trial separately in a bar graph. When all of the bars are lined up next to each other, what does the overall shape of the distribution look like? • Extra: The probability of drawing a particular type of card also depends on the number of cards drawn each time. Try doing this activity again but draw samples of three, five or seven cards at a time. Do your chances improve as more cards are taken? • Extra: Probabilities can change your strategies for playing a card game. Can you design an experiment to show how probabilities can help you choose cards and win "Go Fish"? What about other popular card games? Can you invent your own game based on probabilities?   Observations and results Did it take fewer draws to reach a certain color than it took to reach a certain suit or kind of card? Did it take even more draws to reach a specific card?  Mathematicians measure probability by counting and using some very basic math, like addition and division. For example, you can add up the number of spades in a complete deck (13) and divide this by the total number of cards in the deck (52) to get the probability of randomly drawing a spade: 13 in 52, or 25 percent. If you were investigating red cards, kings or the queen of hearts, the odds of randomly drawing one of these from a complete deck are 50 percent (26 in 52); about 7.7 percent (four in 52); or about 1.9 percent (one in 52), respectively. This is why, on average (when done over enough trials), it is easier to draw a red card than a spade, a spade than a king, and a king than the queen of hearts. As you draw cards from a deck, the odds of finding your card change. For example, if you are looking for a spade and do not get it on your first draw, there are still 13 spades in the deck but the deck now holds only 51 cards, so your odds of drawing a spade on the second draw are 13 in 51, or about 25.5 percent. This may not seem like much of an improvement, but with every draw the odds continue to increase.

The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample and is denoted by S. A deck of cards has 52 cards. If one card is randomly selected irrespective of any condition then we have 52 ways in selecting it. Therefore number of all possible outcomes denoted by n(S) = 52. But we want the desired event E in which either a spade or an ace or both is selected. There are 13 spades + 4 aces in a deck of cards. Since the ace of spades appears in both, we have 13+4–1 = 16 choices. So n(E) = 16 ways.

At this point, we might naively say that 26+13+4 cards are a spade, an ace, or red. However, this overcounts the “overlap” cards such as the ace of spades, which is both an ace and a spade. To resolve this, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle . In particular, let [math]A[/math] be the set of red cards, [math]B[/math] be the set of spades, and [math]C[/math] be the set of aces. Then [math]|A \textrm{ or } B \textrm{ or } C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \textrm{ and } B| - |A \textrm{ and } C| - |B \textrm{ and } C| + |A \textrm{ and } B \textrm{ and } C|,[/math] where [math]|S|[/math] denotes the number of elements in [math]S.[/math] [math]|A| = 26, |B| = 13, |C| = 4.[/math] [math]|A \textrm{ and } B| = 0[/math] since there are no red spades, from which it follows that [math]|A \textrm{ and } B \textrm{ and } C| = 0.[/math] [math]|A \textrm{ and } C| = 2[/math] since there are two red aces, and [math]|B \textrm{ and } C| = 1[/math] because of the ace of spades. Then [math]|A \textrm{ or } B \textrm{ or } C| = 26 + 13 + 4 - 0 - 2 - 1 + 0 = 40[/math] . The probability of drawing one of these cards is [math]\dfrac{40}{52} = \boxed{\frac{10}{13}}.[/math] 4.1k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Explanation: Probability of drawing a spade is 13/52, as there are 13 spades in a a pack of cards. Probability of drawing a king is 4/52. When combined with the existing favourable outcome, there is already a king in the pack of spades. So it is 3/52 + 13/52 which = 16/52 (4/13) 7.3k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Let's define events: A=The drawn card is a spade; B= The drawn card is a heart. P(A) = 13/52 = 1/4 (as there are 13 spade cards in a fair deck of 52 cards) P(B) = 13/52 = 1/4 (as there are 13 heart cards in a fair deck of 52 cards) Events A and B are *mutually exclusive events. As by addition theorem of probability, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) for mutually exclusive events . P(spade or heart) = P(A U B) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 *Two or more events are said to be mutually exclusive (disjoint) events, if they can not occur together. A single card is drawn, it can not be both spade and heart, so these events are mutually exclusive events.

Experiments result in outcomes (also called simple events).  A set or collection of outcomes is called an event.  These concepts can be illustrated with a deck of cards.  Pulling a card from the deck is an experiment.  Getting the ace of spades is an outcome (or simple event) (there are 52 possible outcomes for the experiment of drawing a card from a deck.  Events include getting a spade (which event contains 13 outcomes), or getting a king (which event contains 4 outcomes). Probabilities are assigned to the outcomes of an experiment.  We shall only consider experiments where all the outcomes are equally likely.  Hence for drawing a card from a deck, each outcome has probability 1/52.  The probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in the event, hence the probability of drawing a spade is 13/52 = 1/4, and the probability of drawing a king is 4/52 = 1/13. Although the fact that the probability of getting a spade is 1/4 may make it seem that events are equally likely (since there are four suits), the probability of getting a face card is not equal to the probability of getting a number card.  The only way to calculate the probability of an event is to sum the probabilities of the (equally likely) outcomes in the event.  However, identifying what the equally likely outcomes are can be subtle as the following exercise illustrates.  Exercise:  What are the equally likely outcomes for flipping a pair of coins?  What are the equally likely outcomes for rolling a pair of dice?   Additive rule Since the the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes which comprise the event, one might assume that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of any events which comprise that event.  However, The probability of getting a black card or an ace [which we may denote as P(black or ace)] is not P(black) + P(ace) since the former is 28/52 (there are 26 black cards and 2 red aces) while the latter is 26/52 + 4/52.  The discrepancy is due to the fact that the black aces are counted twice on the right hand side, once with the black cards and once with the aces.  Correcting for the double counting provides the additive rule for arbitrary events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).  Indeed 28/52 = 26/52 + 4/52 - 2/52 (there are two black aces). Definition.  Two events A and B are said to be mutually exclusive (or disjoint) if their intersection is empty (or equivalently, P(A and B) = 0). For example, the events getting a club and getting a one-eyed jack are mutually excllusive because the one-eyed jacks are the jacks of spades and hearts.  The events getting a heart and getting a one-eyed jack are not mutually exclusive, because the jack of hearts is both a heart and a one eyed-jack.  The additve rule for mutually exclusive events is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) (because P(a and B) which should be subtracted from the right hand side is equal to zero). Definiton: A' (read A complement) is the set of outcomes which are not in A.  It follows that P(A or A') = 1 and P(A and A') = 0.   Competencies: WHat is P(black or 2) What is P(Black and 2)?  If you fip 3 coins, what is the probability of getting two heads?  If you roll two dice, what is the probability that the sum of the pips will be 5? If P(A)=.4, P(B)=.3 and P(A and B)=.2, what is P(A or B)=? If A is the set of one-eyed jacks, what is A'?  Reflection: Can you think of an experiment where the outcomes are not equally likely events?  Challenge:   May 2002  return to index   campbell@math.uni.edu      The Addition Rule  Recall from set theory that the word or goes with the set operation union. Now that we are studying probability we need to associate the word or with addition. Here is the general addition rule: In words, whenever we want to find the probability of event A or event B occurring, we add the probability of event A occurring to the probability of event B occurring, and then subtract the probability of both A and B occurring. Ex Let H be the event that Charlie orders a hamburger and F be the event that Charlie orders french fries. So, , and . Now, let's use the formula. Ex Let A be the event that a spade is drawn and let B be the event that a face card is drawn. , because there are 13 cards that are spades. , because there are 12 face cards (3 in each suit). Finally, because there are 3 cards that are spades and face cards, namely the Jack of spades, the Queen of Spades, and the King of spades. Let's go to the formula. There is a special addition rule to cover the case when the two events are mutually exclusive. Recall that mutually exclusive means that the two events do not intersect, in other words, . Well, if , then Ex Let A be the event that she buys the dress at Sears, and let B be the event that she buys the dress at J C Penney. SoThis page may be out of date.

Undo   Manjunath Subramanya Iyer , I am a retired bank officer teaching maths Answered Mar 24, 2018 · Author has 1.5k answers and 75.4k answer views Probability of an event = Number of outcomes favourable to that event/ Number of all possible outcomes. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample and is denoted by S. A deck of cards has 52 cards. If one card is randomly selected irrespective of any condition then we have 52 ways in selecting it. Therefore number of all possible outcomes denoted by n(S) = 52. But we want the desired event E in which either a spade or an ace or both is selected. There are 13 spades + 4 aces in a deck of cards. Since the ace of spades appears in both, we have 13+4–1 = 16 choices. So n(E) = 16 ways. Hence the probability of selecting a spade or an ace or both is = 16/52 = 4/13 168 Views   Jatin Mukheja , Associate Project Manager at GradeUp Answered Mar 17, 2015 · Author has 54 answers and 135.7k answer views In a deck of cards,there are 13 spade,4 ace cards out of total 52 cards. but out of these 13 spade cards,1 is ace already,so total favourable cards for us are 13+4-1=16. so probability=16/52 =4/13 38.9k Views · View Upvoters   Larry Denburg , Professional magician.

A counting challenge from Science Buddies By Science Buddies on September 27, 2012 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: George Retseck Advertisement   Key concepts Mathematics Probability Chance Strategy Cards   Introduction Have you ever been playing cards and wished you could use psychic powers to draw the card you wanted? You may not be psychic, but you can still have the power of probability on your side. In this activity you'll investigate the probabilities of drawing specific types of cards from a deck. You'll discover how math can help you avoid the dreaded phrase, "Go fish!"   Background When you draw a card from a deck, you have a certain chance of getting a specific type of card, such as a spade or face card, or one particular card, such as the queen of hearts. Consider the game "Go Fish" with a regular card deck. The goal is to get the most four-of-a-kind sets by asking your opponent for matching cards or by drawing them from the deck. To win, you can rely on chance or you can increase your probability of getting matching cards, but how?  By understanding how chance is related to math, you can play with a winning strategy. For example, if you have three kings and one queen in your hand and it's your turn to ask for a card, which one should you ask your opponent for? You might think you should ask for a king, but it's actually better to take a queen! Why? Because you have a better chance of getting it. There are four kings and four queens in the deck, and with three kings and one queen in your hand, there's one king and three queens left. This gives you only one chance to get a king, but three chances to get a queen out of the remaining cards.   Materials •     Standard deck of playing cards •     Piece of paper •     Pencil or pen •     Calculator   Preparation •     Count the cards in the deck and make sure it is complete. (There should be 54 cards total.) Take out the two jokers. Shuffle the deck three times and set aside. •     Pick four types of cards to investigate, such as a color, suit, number or face card, and a specific one. For example, you could investigate red cards, spades, kings and the queen of hearts. •     Draw a table to in which to record your data. Make a column for each card type you'll investigate. In the first row write how many of that type of card are in the deck. For example, there are 26 red cards in a deck, 13 spades, four kings and one queen of hearts. Make 10 rows below this one for the 10 trials you will be doing.   Procedure •     Decide which type of card you will investigate first. Draw cards from the top of the deck and flip them over one at a time, counting as you go, and stop when you see that type of card. How many cards did you draw until you reached that card? Write down the answer in your table. •     Shuffle the deck again and repeat this process, flipping over the cards and looking for the same type of card. How many cards did it take this time? Write down the answer in your table. Repeat this for a total of 10 times for one type of card. •     Repeat this process for each of the four types of cards you picked to investigate. This means that you will have looked for each type of card a total of 10 times. •     Calculate the average number of cards you drew to reach each type of card. Label the last row in your table "Averages" and write them in this row. • Which types of cards were the easiest to draw? Which were the most difficult? How do you think the chances of drawing a card relate to the total number of that card type in the deck? • Based on what you saw in this activity, how do you think probability can help you choose the right strategy in a card game? • Extra: A more advanced way of showing the results of your experiment would be to make histograms, which are a type of graph to show distributions. Try making a separate histogram for each type of card you tested by graphing the number of cards drawn for each trial separately in a bar graph. When all of the bars are lined up next to each other, what does the overall shape of the distribution look like? • Extra: The probability of drawing a particular type of card also depends on the number of cards drawn each time. Try doing this activity again but draw samples of three, five or seven cards at a time. Do your chances improve as more cards are taken? • Extra: Probabilities can change your strategies for playing a card game. Can you design an experiment to show how probabilities can help you choose cards and win "Go Fish"? What about other popular card games? Can you invent your own game based on probabilities?   Observations and results Did it take fewer draws to reach a certain color than it took to reach a certain suit or kind of card? Did it take even more draws to reach a specific card?  Mathematicians measure probability by counting and using some very basic math, like addition and division. For example, you can add up the number of spades in a complete deck (13) and divide this by the total number of cards in the deck (52) to get the probability of randomly drawing a spade: 13 in 52, or 25 percent. If you were investigating red cards, kings or the queen of hearts, the odds of randomly drawing one of these from a complete deck are 50 percent (26 in 52); about 7.7 percent (four in 52); or about 1.9 percent (one in 52), respectively. This is why, on average (when done over enough trials), it is easier to draw a red card than a spade, a spade than a king, and a king than the queen of hearts. As you draw cards from a deck, the odds of finding your card change. For example, if you are looking for a spade and do not get it on your first draw, there are still 13 spades in the deck but the deck now holds only 51 cards, so your odds of drawing a spade on the second draw are 13 in 51, or about 25.5 percent. This may not seem like much of an improvement, but with every draw the odds continue to increase.

What's the probability that it is neither a spade ($\spadesuit$) or jack?   I got $$\frac{12}{52}\cdot \frac{4}{52}=\frac{48}{2704}=1.78\%$$ Did I do this right?    probability  proof-verification     share | cite | improve this question      edited Oct 1 '15 at 0:42       Winther   19.5k 3 27 52        asked Sep 30 '15 at 19:48       Devin Toadvine   1 2              1      No, very far from the truth.  You will be happy if the card is neither a spade nor a Jack. How many cards will make you happy?  Lots. If you do not know an efficient way of counting, do it inefficiently. – André Nicolas  Sep 30 '15 at 19:52             work with complements of sets [neither $A$ nor $B$] $\Leftrightarrow$ [not (<$A$ and not $B$> or <$A$ and $B$> or <not $A$ and $B$>) ] – Max  Sep 30 '15 at 19:56         1      It would have been much better if you had explained your thought process instead of just writing down a more or less random formula. – mrf  Sep 30 '15 at 20:30            Do you even know the compound inequality that every probability must satisfy? Obviously not. – Benedict Voltaire  Sep 30 '15 at 21:05        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote      No.  If your first fraction had been $13/52$, that would have been the probability that the card was both a spade and a jack, but that would have been much easier obtained as the probability of drawing the jack of spades: $1/52$.  In point of fact, the probability you ended up with, $3/169$, is less than the probability of drawing any individual card, so it cannot be correct.  One good way of arriving at the correct result is to think of how many cards are neither a jack nor a spade.  Of the $52$ cards, $52-13 = 39$ are not spades; but of those, $3$ are jacks, leaving $36$.  So the desired probability is $36/52 = 9/13$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 30 '15 at 19:54       Brian Tung   23.3k 2 23 49              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      There are $4$ jacks in the deck and $13$ spades. However $1$ jack is a spade so we have a total of $16$ cards which are either a jack or a spade. Therefore there are $52-16=36$ cards which are not a jack or a spade. Thus the probability is $36/52$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 30 '15 at 19:52       Ben   499 2 10                  Why am I not multiplying them separately? – Devin Toadvine  Sep 30 '15 at 19:59            For this question, the probability is (#number of cards not a spade or a Jack) / (#number of cards). We know the number of cards is 52, and its easy to calculate how many cards are not a spade or a jack so calculating the probability is easy. – Ben  Sep 30 '15 at 20:02         add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

$$=1 \times 1 \times 2+ 2 \times 12 \times 1 \times 3 + 12 \times 12 \times 4$$
$$ = 2+72+576=650$$  $$n(\Omega)= 52 \times 51 \times 50 $$

I was thinking that we'd do $\frac{13}{52} \cdot (\frac{4}{51} + \frac{3}{51})$, since the first card could have been an ace. Is this correct?    probability  combinatorics  card-games     share | cite | improve this question     asked Aug 14 '17 at 17:46       Tiwa Aina   2,243 2 16                  No, that is not correct. The (wrong) formula $$\frac{13}{52}\cdot \frac{4}{51}$$ is wrong because it over-caclulates the probability, since it gives more cases of the second card being an ace. But your answer is greater than this wrong formula, so it is necessarily wrong, too. – Thomas Andrews  Aug 14 '17 at 17:49        add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      An alternate approach is that the first card is a spade with probability $\frac{13}{52}.$ Of those case, $\frac{1}{13}$ was the spade ace, and $\frac{12}{13}$ were not the ace. So the probability is:  $$\frac{13}{52}\left(\frac{1}{13}\cdot\frac{3}{51}+\frac{12}{13}\cdot\frac{4}{51}\right)$$  If $X$ is the even that the first card is a spade ace and $Y$ is the event that the first card is another spade we get, and $Z$ is the event that the second card is an ace, this formula is:  $$P((X\lor Y)\land Z)=P(X\lor Y)\left(P(X\mid X\lor Y)P(Z\mid X)+P(Y\mid X\lor Y)P(Z\mid Y)\right)$$  This is true in general if $X$ and $Y$ are disjoint events.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Aug 14 '17 at 18:04             answered Aug 14 '17 at 17:54       Thomas Andrews   126k 10 140 278                  I knew it could have been done using distributive multiplication! Thanks. – Tiwa Aina  Aug 14 '17 at 17:59        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      So the probability that the first card is a non-ace spade is $12/52$, and the probability that we pull an ace after that is $4/51$. On the other hand, the probability that we draw the ace of spades is $1/52$, and the chance of pulling another ace is $3/51$. All together we have  $$\frac{12}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51}+\frac{1}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 14 '17 at 17:49       Elliot G   9,097 2 13 42                  Ohh, that makes sense. How do I improve on these types of probability questions? Would this be categorized as casework probability? – Tiwa Aina  Aug 14 '17 at 17:53            When possible, I like to draw (or imagine) a tree diagram. That way it becomes more obvious when you've said something nonsensical. In this case, you double counted cases like drawing two ace of spades. – Elliot G  Aug 14 '17 at 17:56        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Another way to see this is to note that the events (1st card is Spade) and (2nd card is Ace) are independent because knowledge of the suit of the first card can't affect the probability of an Ace on the second card. Then  $P$(1st Spade and 2nd Ace) = $P$(1st Spade)$P$(2nd Ace) = (1/4)(1/13) = 1/52  which of course is the same as the solutions given above.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 14 '17 at 23:38       Ned   1,622 8 9                  the solutions above give 1/51, not 1/52. Interestingly, the comment by Thomas Andrews saying the (wrong) formula is (13*4)/(52*51) also gives 1/51. – stretch  Aug 16 '17 at 11:46            The solutions above give (48+3) / (52*51) = 1/52 – Ned  Aug 17 '17 at 21:38        add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

But this is the same each time since you draw with replacement. Therefore, since each event is independent, you can multiply the probabilities:
$$P(S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4) = P(S_1)P(S_2)P(S_3)P(S_4) = \left(\frac{13}{52}\right)^4,$$
where $S_i = \text{Spade on draw $i$}$, for $i = 1,2,3,4$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 17 '15 at 0:33             answered Dec 17 '15 at 0:21       Max   14.8k 7 19 35              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Yes this is a typical 'AND' problem where you multiply probabilities.

I was trying to solve it by the formula of conditional probability P(B|A) = (JOINT PROBABILITY OF A AND B) / PROBABILITY OF A.   Joint probability of A and B will be $\dfrac{{13\choose 1} \times {13\choose 1} }{{52\choose 2} }$.  Probability of A is $1/4$  Dividing these two gives the result as $26/51$ .

One draws three cards at a time and one of these cards must be discarded, so two of three drawn cards can be used.  A typical problem and question in this game would be:  What is the probability of drawing one spade AND one of either 10,9 or 8 (call it Middle cards) with drawing three cards?   We could have 10,9,8 of spades but we will need either another spade or another of the same group the draw to be successful.  My approach was following - Success scenarios:   Spade and Middle Card - 13/52*10/51  Spade and Middle Spade 10/52*3/51  Middle and Middle Spade 9/52*3/51  Middle Spade and Middle Spade 3/52*2/51   But this is for drawing 2 cards, how shall I input the third card drawing possibility into this?    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question     asked Feb 27 '15 at 12:39       SKYTTEN   58 7              add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      In this case I find it a little easier to calculate the probability of failing to get what you want; then you can subtract that from $1$ to get the desired probability. You fail if you draw no spade or no middle card. There are $\binom{39}3$ ways to draw three non-spades, and there are $\binom{40}3$ ways to draw no middle card. However, some sets of three cards have been counted twice, because they contain neither a spade nor a middle card. There are $13$ spades and $9$ non-spade middle cards, so there are $30$ cards that are neither spades nor middle cards and therefore $\binom{30}3$ sets of three cards that are ‘bad’ in both ways. Altogether, then, there are  $$\binom{39}3+\binom{40}3-\binom{30}3$$  bad draws out of the total of $\binom{52}3$ possible draws, and the desired probability is  $$1-\frac{\binom{39}3+\binom{40}3-\binom{30}3}{\binom{52}3}\;,$$  which is a little less than $\frac13$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 27 '15 at 21:15       Brian M.

Still, I couldn't get my head around the problem where I had intersection between the sets. Could you please explain more about the third number in the equation (30,3). Still cannot figure out how to arrive to that thought of subtracting this number. Is that because we counted some cards twice and this subtraction takes care of that excess? – SKYTTEN  Feb 28 '15 at 9:28             @SKYTTEN: You're welcome. Yes, it is. Every set of three cards that contains no spades and no middle cards is counted once in the $\binom{39}3$ and once again in the $\binom{40}3$. There are $\binom{30}3$ such sets, and every one of them has been counted twice in the sum $\binom{39}3+\binom{40}3$. In order to compensate, we must subtract $1$ for each of those sets that we've counted twice. This means subtracting $\binom{30}3$. – Brian M.

A counting challenge from Science Buddies By Science Buddies on September 27, 2012 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: George Retseck Advertisement   Key concepts Mathematics Probability Chance Strategy Cards   Introduction Have you ever been playing cards and wished you could use psychic powers to draw the card you wanted? You may not be psychic, but you can still have the power of probability on your side. In this activity you'll investigate the probabilities of drawing specific types of cards from a deck. You'll discover how math can help you avoid the dreaded phrase, "Go fish!"   Background When you draw a card from a deck, you have a certain chance of getting a specific type of card, such as a spade or face card, or one particular card, such as the queen of hearts. Consider the game "Go Fish" with a regular card deck. The goal is to get the most four-of-a-kind sets by asking your opponent for matching cards or by drawing them from the deck. To win, you can rely on chance or you can increase your probability of getting matching cards, but how?  By understanding how chance is related to math, you can play with a winning strategy. For example, if you have three kings and one queen in your hand and it's your turn to ask for a card, which one should you ask your opponent for? You might think you should ask for a king, but it's actually better to take a queen! Why? Because you have a better chance of getting it. There are four kings and four queens in the deck, and with three kings and one queen in your hand, there's one king and three queens left. This gives you only one chance to get a king, but three chances to get a queen out of the remaining cards.   Materials •     Standard deck of playing cards •     Piece of paper •     Pencil or pen •     Calculator   Preparation •     Count the cards in the deck and make sure it is complete. (There should be 54 cards total.) Take out the two jokers. Shuffle the deck three times and set aside. •     Pick four types of cards to investigate, such as a color, suit, number or face card, and a specific one. For example, you could investigate red cards, spades, kings and the queen of hearts. •     Draw a table to in which to record your data. Make a column for each card type you'll investigate. In the first row write how many of that type of card are in the deck. For example, there are 26 red cards in a deck, 13 spades, four kings and one queen of hearts. Make 10 rows below this one for the 10 trials you will be doing.   Procedure •     Decide which type of card you will investigate first. Draw cards from the top of the deck and flip them over one at a time, counting as you go, and stop when you see that type of card. How many cards did you draw until you reached that card? Write down the answer in your table. •     Shuffle the deck again and repeat this process, flipping over the cards and looking for the same type of card. How many cards did it take this time? Write down the answer in your table. Repeat this for a total of 10 times for one type of card. •     Repeat this process for each of the four types of cards you picked to investigate. This means that you will have looked for each type of card a total of 10 times. •     Calculate the average number of cards you drew to reach each type of card. Label the last row in your table "Averages" and write them in this row. • Which types of cards were the easiest to draw? Which were the most difficult? How do you think the chances of drawing a card relate to the total number of that card type in the deck? • Based on what you saw in this activity, how do you think probability can help you choose the right strategy in a card game? • Extra: A more advanced way of showing the results of your experiment would be to make histograms, which are a type of graph to show distributions. Try making a separate histogram for each type of card you tested by graphing the number of cards drawn for each trial separately in a bar graph. When all of the bars are lined up next to each other, what does the overall shape of the distribution look like? • Extra: The probability of drawing a particular type of card also depends on the number of cards drawn each time. Try doing this activity again but draw samples of three, five or seven cards at a time. Do your chances improve as more cards are taken? • Extra: Probabilities can change your strategies for playing a card game. Can you design an experiment to show how probabilities can help you choose cards and win "Go Fish"? What about other popular card games? Can you invent your own game based on probabilities?   Observations and results Did it take fewer draws to reach a certain color than it took to reach a certain suit or kind of card? Did it take even more draws to reach a specific card?  Mathematicians measure probability by counting and using some very basic math, like addition and division. For example, you can add up the number of spades in a complete deck (13) and divide this by the total number of cards in the deck (52) to get the probability of randomly drawing a spade: 13 in 52, or 25 percent. If you were investigating red cards, kings or the queen of hearts, the odds of randomly drawing one of these from a complete deck are 50 percent (26 in 52); about 7.7 percent (four in 52); or about 1.9 percent (one in 52), respectively. This is why, on average (when done over enough trials), it is easier to draw a red card than a spade, a spade than a king, and a king than the queen of hearts. As you draw cards from a deck, the odds of finding your card change. For example, if you are looking for a spade and do not get it on your first draw, there are still 13 spades in the deck but the deck now holds only 51 cards, so your odds of drawing a spade on the second draw are 13 in 51, or about 25.5 percent. This may not seem like much of an improvement, but with every draw the odds continue to increase.

The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample and is denoted by S. A deck of cards has 52 cards. If one card is randomly selected irrespective of any condition then we have 52 ways in selecting it. Therefore number of all possible outcomes denoted by n(S) = 52. But we want the desired event E in which either a spade or an ace or both is selected. There are 13 spades + 4 aces in a deck of cards. Since the ace of spades appears in both, we have 13+4–1 = 16 choices. So n(E) = 16 ways. Hence the probability of selecting a spade or an ace or both is = 16/52 = 4/13 168 Views   Jatin Mukheja , Associate Project Manager at GradeUp Answered Mar 17, 2015 · Author has 54 answers and 135.7k answer views In a deck of cards,there are 13 spade,4 ace cards out of total 52 cards. but out of these 13 spade cards,1 is ace already,so total favourable cards for us are 13+4-1=16. so probability=16/52 =4/13 38.9k Views · View Upvoters   Larry Denburg , Professional magician.

At this point, we might naively say that 26+13+4 cards are a spade, an ace, or red. However, this overcounts the “overlap” cards such as the ace of spades, which is both an ace and a spade.

Ask New Question   Ramya Mure , Published a paper on Probability Answered Mar 1, 2016 The answer is 4/13. Explanation: Probability of drawing a spade is 13/52, as there are 13 spades in a a pack of cards. Probability of drawing a king is 4/52. When combined with the existing favourable outcome, there is already a king in the pack of spades. So it is 3/52 + 13/52 which = 16/52 (4/13) 7.3k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

BUT you specifically said EITHER, not either or. This means that a draw that is both a king and a spade must be left out.

Answered Mar 14, 2016 · Author has 186 answers and 278.5k answer views Nisha Arora's answer to How do I know when to 'add' and when to 'multiply' in questions based on probability? may be helpful. Let's define events: A=The drawn card is a spade; B= The drawn card is a heart. P(A) = 13/52 = 1/4 (as there are 13 spade cards in a fair deck of 52 cards) P(B) = 13/52 = 1/4 (as there are 13 heart cards in a fair deck of 52 cards) Events A and B are *mutually exclusive events. As by addition theorem of probability, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) for mutually exclusive events . P(spade or heart) = P(A U B) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 *Two or more events are said to be mutually exclusive (disjoint) events, if they can not occur together. A single card is drawn, it can not be both spade and heart, so these events are mutually exclusive events. If you not more clarification/examples on the concepts of mutually exclusive events or addition theorem, please comment. 671 Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Answer by macston(5194)   ( Show Source ): You can put this solution on YOUR website! . 13 spades/52 cards=1/4                              Probability and the additive rule   Probability  Additive rule   Probability Probability is the study of experiments.  Experiments result in outcomes (also called simple events).  A set or collection of outcomes is called an event.  These concepts can be illustrated with a deck of cards.  Pulling a card from the deck is an experiment.  Getting the ace of spades is an outcome (or simple event) (there are 52 possible outcomes for the experiment of drawing a card from a deck.  Events include getting a spade (which event contains 13 outcomes), or getting a king (which event contains 4 outcomes). Probabilities are assigned to the outcomes of an experiment.  We shall only consider experiments where all the outcomes are equally likely.  Hence for drawing a card from a deck, each outcome has probability 1/52.  The probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in the event, hence the probability of drawing a spade is 13/52 = 1/4, and the probability of drawing a king is 4/52 = 1/13. Although the fact that the probability of getting a spade is 1/4 may make it seem that events are equally likely (since there are four suits), the probability of getting a face card is not equal to the probability of getting a number card.  The only way to calculate the probability of an event is to sum the probabilities of the (equally likely) outcomes in the event.  However, identifying what the equally likely outcomes are can be subtle as the following exercise illustrates.  Exercise:  What are the equally likely outcomes for flipping a pair of coins?  What are the equally likely outcomes for rolling a pair of dice?   Additive rule Since the the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes which comprise the event, one might assume that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of any events which comprise that event.  However, The probability of getting a black card or an ace [which we may denote as P(black or ace)] is not P(black) + P(ace) since the former is 28/52 (there are 26 black cards and 2 red aces) while the latter is 26/52 + 4/52.  The discrepancy is due to the fact that the black aces are counted twice on the right hand side, once with the black cards and once with the aces.  Correcting for the double counting provides the additive rule for arbitrary events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).  Indeed 28/52 = 26/52 + 4/52 - 2/52 (there are two black aces). Definition.  Two events A and B are said to be mutually exclusive (or disjoint) if their intersection is empty (or equivalently, P(A and B) = 0). For example, the events getting a club and getting a one-eyed jack are mutually excllusive because the one-eyed jacks are the jacks of spades and hearts.  The events getting a heart and getting a one-eyed jack are not mutually exclusive, because the jack of hearts is both a heart and a one eyed-jack.  The additve rule for mutually exclusive events is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) (because P(a and B) which should be subtracted from the right hand side is equal to zero). Definiton: A' (read A complement) is the set of outcomes which are not in A.  It follows that P(A or A') = 1 and P(A and A') = 0.   Competencies: WHat is P(black or 2) What is P(Black and 2)?  If you fip 3 coins, what is the probability of getting two heads?  If you roll two dice, what is the probability that the sum of the pips will be 5? If P(A)=.4, P(B)=.3 and P(A and B)=.2, what is P(A or B)=? If A is the set of one-eyed jacks, what is A'?  Reflection: Can you think of an experiment where the outcomes are not equally likely events?  Challenge:   May 2002  return to index   campbell@math.uni.edu      The Addition Rule  Recall from set theory that the word or goes with the set operation union. Now that we are studying probability we need to associate the word or with addition. Here is the general addition rule: In words, whenever we want to find the probability of event A or event B occurring, we add the probability of event A occurring to the probability of event B occurring, and then subtract the probability of both A and B occurring. Ex Let H be the event that Charlie orders a hamburger and F be the event that Charlie orders french fries. So, , and . Now, let's use the formula. Ex Let A be the event that a spade is drawn and let B be the event that a face card is drawn. , because there are 13 cards that are spades. , because there are 12 face cards (3 in each suit). Finally, because there are 3 cards that are spades and face cards, namely the Jack of spades, the Queen of Spades, and the King of spades. Let's go to the formula. There is a special addition rule to cover the case when the two events are mutually exclusive. Recall that mutually exclusive means that the two events do not intersect, in other words, . Well, if , then Ex Let A be the event that she buys the dress at Sears, and let B be the event that she buys the dress at J C Penney. So
