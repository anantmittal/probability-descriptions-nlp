Although there are some genetic conditions and environmental factors which may contribute to the development of brain cancer, the risk factors are much less defined for brain cancer than for other cancers in the body.  Also, the risk of developing primary brain cancer is very low. The American Cancer Society estimates the risk over a lifetime is less than one percent.  It’s important to remember that a brain cancer risk factor only affects the probability of developing brain cancer over a lifetime. For example, if you’ve received radiation therapy to treat another cancer, or if you’ve worked in an industry where you handled potentially cancerous chemicals, you may want to discuss with your doctor what it means for your individual risk of developing brain cancer.                   Understanding risk factors  Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer. Not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss it with your doctor.

Getty Images (2) According to the American Brain Tumor Association, about 80,000 men, women, and children were expected to be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor during 2017. ( 1 ) The estimate includes both benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) brain tumors. The American Cancer Society predicts that in 2018, about 23,880 people will be diagnosed with a malignant brain or spinal cord tumor and about 70 percent of those with a malignant tumor will not survive as a result of their diagnosis. ( 2 ) Here’s what you need to know about brain tumor prevalence and survival rates based on the type of brain tumor, age, sex, and race. The Most Prevalent Types of Brain Tumors There are more than 120 known types of brain tumors, with some more prevalent than others. ( 3 ) Of all the types of brain tumors, meningioma, glioma, and glioblastoma are the most common. Meningioma , a tumor that arises from the meninges, represents 36.6 percent of all primary brain tumors, making them the most common primary brain tumor. Most are slow-growing and benign. Glioma, a broad category of tumor that includes all tumors within the gluey or supportive tissue of the brain, accounts for 24.7 percent of all primary brain tumors. Of the malignant brain tumors, 74.6 percent are gliomas. (1) Glioblastomas are a subset of gliomas that arise from astrocytes, or the star-shaped cells in the brain. These tumors represent 14.9 percent of all primary brain tumors and 55.4 percent of all gliomas. Glioblastomas are highly malignant because the cells reproduce quickly and are fed by a large network of blood vessels. ( 4 ) Do Brain Tumors Affect Men and Women Differently? The chance that an individual develops a brain tumor is very small, with a lifetime risk of 1 percent or less. But there is a slight variation in the risk of developing a brain tumor for males and females. (1) According to a study published in 2015 in the journal Cellular and Molecular Life Science , males not only develop more cancers, but they frequently have poorer responses to therapy as measured by overall brain tumor rates and survival rates. ( 5 ) In 2016, an estimated 13,450 men had a brain tumor in comparison to 10,350 women. ( 6 ) It is unclear why men have a predisposition towards developing more cancer; biological factors may describe the differences in rates of brain tumors in a certain sex. According to a study published in Journal of the National Cancer Institute , hormonal differences could result in different prevalence rates between men and women. ( 7 ) “Meningioma is more common in women than men,” says Harmon Eyre, MD, former chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, “probably because this particular tumor has estrogen and progestin receptors.” (6,7) Other cancers and brain tumors, such as Hodgkin lymphoma , occur in more men than women, and professionals are not entirely sure why that’s the case. (7, 8 ) Brain Tumors in Children and Adults Brain tumors can appear differently in children in comparison to adults. The median age for all primary brain tumors is 59, but brain tumors are the most common form of solid tumors among children under age 15, and represent about 20 percent of all childhood cancers. (1, 9 ) It is estimated that more than 4,800 children and adolescents received a diagnosis of primary brain tumor, either benign or malignant, in 2017. Although children of any age may be affected, brain tumors are the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for children up to age 14. (1) The most common brain tumors in children are: Astrocytomas Medulloblastomas Ependymomas Brainstem gliomas ( 10 ) Brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the third most common cancer and third most common cause of cancer death occurring among adolescents and young adults between age 15 and 39. (1) How Many People Survive a Brain Tumor Diagnosis? Survival rates give a general idea of the outlook or prognosis of a certain brain tumor. They provide a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be successful. The risk of developing a brain tumor is quite low. Less than 1 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with a brain or CNS tumor during their lifetime, based on 2010–2014 data on new cases and deaths. ( 11 ) According to the 2016 report by the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, the risk of American males developing a primary malignant brain or CNS tumor is 0.69 percent, and the risk of dying from this diagnosis is 0.51 percent. The risk of females developing a primary malignant brain or CNS tumor is slightly smaller at 0.55 percent, with a 0.41 percent risk of dying. ( 12 ) The five-year relative survival rate, or a comparison of survival rates for those with a brain tumor in the United States versus the survival rate of the overall U.S. population, for those with a brain or CNS tumor is 33.6 percent. In other words, on average, those with a brain or CNS tumor are 33.6 percent as likely to live for at least five years after being diagnosed as those who do not have a brain tumor.

But although the symptoms of most brain tumors are the same, not all tumors are malignant.  In fact, meningioma is the most common brain tumor, accounting for about 30 percent of them. Meningioma tumors are often benign: You may not even need surgery.  Here are five key meningioma facts you need to know:  1. Meningiomas can grow in different places.  These tumors arise from cells in the meninges, the lining of the brain and spinal cord. So technically speaking, they’re not brain tumors at all since they don’t result from mutated brain cells.  But they still grow inside your skull, which means there’s cause for concern. If a meningioma grows or causes swelling that presses against the brain or other structures in the skull, it can cause brain tumor symptoms.  2. Meningioma symptoms depend on their size and location.  Meningiomas present with typical brain tumor symptoms such as headaches, vision problems or seizures. A headache--even a severe one--on its own is seldom a symptom of meningioma or any other brain tumor.  Larger meningiomas can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in hydrocephalus (“water on the brain”) which can affect gait and memory. Other tumor locations can affect your sense of smell, vision, hearing or even the function of your pituitary gland.   3. A meningioma diagnosis may occur when the doctor is looking for something else.  Brain tumor diagnosis is often incidental — that is, the doctor discovers a tumor on a CT or MRI while examining the individual for another reason such as a head injury or another neurologic problem.  When a doctor diagnoses a meningioma, you will get further tests to find out how the tumor is likely to behave. Based on these data, a neurosurgeon will recommend removing the tumor or just watching it to see if it grows.  4. Most meningiomas do not spread.  It can be shocking for someone to be diagnosed with a meningioma — especially a large one — but these tumors are usually benign. This means that the tumor cells are not likely to spread to other parts of the body.  That said, meningiomas can quietly grow for years without causing any problems — and they can get surprisingly large.  5. Meningioma treatment: surgery — or not  Sometimes, believe it or not, your doctor may recommend observation for meningioma, especially if it’s small and not causing problems. You’ll have regular MRIs to check on it.  Otherwise, the main treatment for meningiomas is surgery to remove it, through a craniotomy or other procedure. Your doctor will go over what the operation will involve, the approach to access the tumor and what you can expect afterward.  How does a neurosurgeon operate on a meningioma? It’s all about location. Depending on where the tumor is, each approach will be different. Tumors close to the surface are typically easier to access than those located along the skull base.  Skull base tumors are those located deep in the skull, behind the nose or eyes. These can be challenging, and call for surgeons with skill and expertise in this kind of surgery.  There are a number of new techniques in brain tumor surgery, even for tumors located deep in the skull, and some of these are less invasive.  One system involves a camera-assisted tube that gently moves brain tissue aside so surgeons can reach the tumor with less cutting, so patients can recover faster,  After your treatment you will have regular MRIs to ensure the tumor isn’t returning.  In many cases, it won’t. After 10 years, about 90 percent of patients who have had a meningioma have not seen a recurrence if the tumor is removed completely, including the part of the brain lining from which it grew.  Regardless, the best thing to do if you’re diagnosed with a meningioma or any other tumor is to get the facts, stay informed and work with the most experienced neurosurgeon and care team you can find.

When you are diagnosed with a serious illness, like a spinal cord or brain tumor , learning about survival rates and prognosis for your condition can make you panic even more. But, it’s important to keep in mind that survival rates are simply statistics ; they do not apply to one specific person. Statistics are gathered about a group of patients with a certain disorder, such as a brain tumor, within a certain time frame. In general, to get an accurate statistic it’s necessary to have a relatively large group of people. But spinal cord and brain tumors are very rare forms of cancer, accounting for less than 2 percent of all cancers. This small number of patients makes it difficult for statisticians to gather and analyze information. In addition, there are more than 120 types of brain tumors, making an already difficult job harder. So, while it is important to know about survival rates for spinal cord and brain tumors, don't rely too heavily on the numbers. Your situation may be different. The best source for specific information for your individual prognosis is your own doctor. Have a candid discussion with your doctor about your long-term outlook. Brain Tumor Prognosis: The Stats As you read the rates below, remember that these numbers are not guarantees, but a general idea of the severity of some types of brain tumors. Based on information collected from 2000 to 2004, for people diagnosed with a primary malignant brain and spinal cord tumor (including lymphoma and leukemia , tumors of the pituitary and pineal glands, and tumors of the nose), the five-year survival rates are 28.8 percent for males and 31.6 percent for females. A five-year survival rate refers to the proportion of people who are still alive five years following a diagnosis . When those five-year survival rates were further broken down by age at diagnosis, the relative survival rates were: Age 0 to 19 years: 66.0 percent Age 20 to 24 years: 49.2 percent Age 45 to 54 years: 24.0 percent Age 55 to 64 years: 11.1 percent Age 65 to 74 years: 6.7 percent Age 75 or older: 4.7 percent A relative survival rate refers to survival odds compared with other U.S. citizens within the same category who do not have a malignant tumor. Brain Tumor: Survival Rates for Meningiomas People with meningiomas, the most common form of brain tumor, had a five-year survival rate of 69 percent. When broken down further, survival rate for people with benign (non-cancerous) meningiomas was 70 percent but, for people with malignant (cancerous) meningiomas, the rate was 55 percent. Brain Tumor: Survival Rates for Glioblastomas About 19 percent of all primary brain tumors are glioblastomas, the most common type of cancerous brain tumors. People with glioblastomas had very low relative survival rates: Less than 4 percent lived five years after diagnosis. The survival rate for some children and adolescents may be up to 25 percent if surgery is effective, but since this is not common, most children with glioblastomas have the same odds as adults. Brain Tumor: Gender and Race As a rule, men get more brain tumors than women, for reasons that are not clear. But, women get more tumors of certain types. Women get three times as many tumors of the meninges (the tissues that cover the spinal cord and brain) as men. Olfactory tumors of the naval cavity are slightly more common in women. Tumors of the cranial nerves (which carry messages between the brain and body parts) are also slightly more common in women. Tumors of the pituitary gland (which helps regulate the thyroid) occur in about 12 percent more women than men. Overall, Caucasians get more brain tumors, such as glioblastoma, than African-Americans; about twice as many. But African-Americans get more tumors of the meninges. The cause of this disparity is not known. Reasons to be Hopeful There are good reasons to be hopeful about the prognosis for spinal cord and brain tumors. Brain tumors are an important research topic; a search on the National Cancer Institute’s Web site for adult glioblastoma clinical trials turned up 249 trials that are recruiting patients. Progress is also being made in the operating room. “Because of new techniques and technology, neurosurgeons can see, reach, and remove tumors that we could never reach before,” says Andrew Sloan, MD, director of the Brain Tumor and Neuro-oncology Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. “We are making a great deal of progress.” Brain Tumor: More Information A good source for spinal cord and brain tumor survival rates is the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (SEER) Cancer Statistics Review (CSR) , which reports statistics regarding cancer and is published annually by the Cancer Statistics Branch of the National Cancer Institute.

Signs and Symptoms of Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors    Tests for Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults    Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults: Prognostic Factors    Survival Rates for Selected Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors    Questions to Ask About Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors             Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging             Survival Rates for Selected Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors       Survival rates are a way to get a general idea of the outlook (prognosis) for people with a certain type of tumor. They tell you what portion of people with the same type of tumor are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.  What is a 5-year survival rate?  The 5-year survival rate is the percentage of people who live at least 5 years after being diagnosed. For example, a 5-year survival rate of 70% means that an estimated 70 out of 100 people who have that type of tumor are still alive 5 years after being diagnosed. Keep in mind, however, that many of these people live much longer than 5 years.  Relative survival rates (like the numbers below) are a more accurate way to estimate the effect of cancer on survival. These rates compare people with cancer to people in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival rate for a specific type of tumor is 70%, it would mean that people who have that type of tumor are, on average, about 70% as likely as people who don’t have that tumor to live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed.  But remember, the 5-year relative survival rates are estimates – your outlook can vary based on a number of factors specific to you.  Survival rates don’t tell the whole story  Survival rates are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had the disease, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. There are some limitations to remember:   Thesenumbers are among the most current available. But to get 5-year survival rates, doctors have to look at people who were treated at least 5 years ago. As treatments are improving over time, people who are now being diagnosed with brain or spinal cord tumors may have a better outlook than these statistics show.  The outlook for people with brain or spinal cord tumors varies by the type of tumor and the person’s age. But many other factors can also affect a person’s outlook, such as their age and overall health, where the tumor is located, and how well the tumor responds to treatment. The outlook for each person is specific to their circumstances.   Your doctor can tell you how these numbers may apply to you, as he or she is familiar with your situation.  Survival rates for more common adult brain and spinal cord tumors  The numbers in the table come from the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) and are based on people who were treated between 2000 and 2014.
     As can be seen below, survival rates for brain and spinal cord tumors can vary widely by age, with younger people tending to have having better outlooks than older people. The survival rates for those 65 or older are generally lower than the rates for the ages listed below.  These numbers are for some of the more common types of brain and spinal cord tumors. Numbers are not readily available for all types of tumors, often because they are rare or are hard to classify.      Type of Tumor    5-Year Relative Survival Rate      Age      20-44    45-54    55-64      Low-grade (diffuse) astrocytoma      68%      44%      22%        Anaplastic astrocytoma      54%      32%      14%        Glioblastoma      19%      8%      5%        Oligodendroglioma      88%      81%      68%        Anaplastic oligodendroglioma      71%      61%      46%        Ependymoma/anaplastic ependymoma      92%      89%      86%        Meningioma      87%      77%      71%        Remember, these survival rates are only estimates – they can’t predict what will happen to any individual. If you find these statistics are confusing and you have more questions, talk to your doctor to better understand your specific situation.

Getty Images (2) According to the American Brain Tumor Association, about 80,000 men, women, and children were expected to be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor during 2017. ( 1 ) The estimate includes both benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) brain tumors. The American Cancer Society predicts that in 2018, about 23,880 people will be diagnosed with a malignant brain or spinal cord tumor and about 70 percent of those with a malignant tumor will not survive as a result of their diagnosis. ( 2 ) Here’s what you need to know about brain tumor prevalence and survival rates based on the type of brain tumor, age, sex, and race. The Most Prevalent Types of Brain Tumors There are more than 120 known types of brain tumors, with some more prevalent than others. ( 3 ) Of all the types of brain tumors, meningioma, glioma, and glioblastoma are the most common. Meningioma , a tumor that arises from the meninges, represents 36.6 percent of all primary brain tumors, making them the most common primary brain tumor. Most are slow-growing and benign. Glioma, a broad category of tumor that includes all tumors within the gluey or supportive tissue of the brain, accounts for 24.7 percent of all primary brain tumors. Of the malignant brain tumors, 74.6 percent are gliomas. (1) Glioblastomas are a subset of gliomas that arise from astrocytes, or the star-shaped cells in the brain. These tumors represent 14.9 percent of all primary brain tumors and 55.4 percent of all gliomas. Glioblastomas are highly malignant because the cells reproduce quickly and are fed by a large network of blood vessels. ( 4 ) Do Brain Tumors Affect Men and Women Differently? The chance that an individual develops a brain tumor is very small, with a lifetime risk of 1 percent or less. But there is a slight variation in the risk of developing a brain tumor for males and females. (1) According to a study published in 2015 in the journal Cellular and Molecular Life Science , males not only develop more cancers, but they frequently have poorer responses to therapy as measured by overall brain tumor rates and survival rates. ( 5 ) In 2016, an estimated 13,450 men had a brain tumor in comparison to 10,350 women. ( 6 ) It is unclear why men have a predisposition towards developing more cancer; biological factors may describe the differences in rates of brain tumors in a certain sex. According to a study published in Journal of the National Cancer Institute , hormonal differences could result in different prevalence rates between men and women. ( 7 ) “Meningioma is more common in women than men,” says Harmon Eyre, MD, former chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, “probably because this particular tumor has estrogen and progestin receptors.” (6,7) Other cancers and brain tumors, such as Hodgkin lymphoma , occur in more men than women, and professionals are not entirely sure why that’s the case. (7, 8 ) Brain Tumors in Children and Adults Brain tumors can appear differently in children in comparison to adults. The median age for all primary brain tumors is 59, but brain tumors are the most common form of solid tumors among children under age 15, and represent about 20 percent of all childhood cancers. (1, 9 ) It is estimated that more than 4,800 children and adolescents received a diagnosis of primary brain tumor, either benign or malignant, in 2017. Although children of any age may be affected, brain tumors are the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for children up to age 14. (1) The most common brain tumors in children are: Astrocytomas Medulloblastomas Ependymomas Brainstem gliomas ( 10 ) Brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the third most common cancer and third most common cause of cancer death occurring among adolescents and young adults between age 15 and 39. (1) How Many People Survive a Brain Tumor Diagnosis? Survival rates give a general idea of the outlook or prognosis of a certain brain tumor. They provide a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be successful. The risk of developing a brain tumor is quite low. Less than 1 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with a brain or CNS tumor during their lifetime, based on 2010–2014 data on new cases and deaths. ( 11 ) According to the 2016 report by the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, the risk of American males developing a primary malignant brain or CNS tumor is 0.69 percent, and the risk of dying from this diagnosis is 0.51 percent. The risk of females developing a primary malignant brain or CNS tumor is slightly smaller at 0.55 percent, with a 0.41 percent risk of dying. ( 12 ) The five-year relative survival rate, or a comparison of survival rates for those with a brain tumor in the United States versus the survival rate of the overall U.S. population, for those with a brain or CNS tumor is 33.6 percent. In other words, on average, those with a brain or CNS tumor are 33.6 percent as likely to live for at least five years after being diagnosed as those who do not have a brain tumor.

Although there are some genetic conditions and environmental factors which may contribute to the development of brain cancer, the risk factors are much less defined for brain cancer than for other cancers in the body.  Also, the risk of developing primary brain cancer is very low. The American Cancer Society estimates the risk over a lifetime is less than one percent.  It’s important to remember that a brain cancer risk factor only affects the probability of developing brain cancer over a lifetime. For example, if you’ve received radiation therapy to treat another cancer, or if you’ve worked in an industry where you handled potentially cancerous chemicals, you may want to discuss with your doctor what it means for your individual risk of developing brain cancer.                   Understanding risk factors  Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer. Not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss it with your doctor.

Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults  About Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults             Key Statistics for Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors       The American Cancer Society’s estimates for brain and spinal cord tumors in the United States for 2018 include both adults and children .   About 23,880 malignant tumors of the brain or spinal cord (13,720 in males and 10,160 in females) will be diagnosed. These numbers would be much higher if benign (non-cancer) tumors were also included.  About 16,830 people (9,490 males and 7,340 females) will die from brain and spinal cord tumors.   Overall, the chance that a person will develop a malignant tumor of the brain or spinal cord in his or her lifetime is less than 1%. The risk for men (about 1 in 143) is slightly higher than that for women (about 1 in 185),
      although certain types of tumors are more common in women.  Survival rates for brain and spinal cord tumors vary widely, depending on the type of tumor (and other factors ). Rates for some of the more common types of brain and spinal cord tumors are discussed in Survival Rates for Selected Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors .

A bad headache can be scary. It’s hard not to think the worst if you’re unlucky enough to suffer with severe headaches . If the pain lasts or recurs, you may wonder if you have a serious problem such as a brain tumor .  Headache: Brain tumor is an uncommon cause  Here’s the reassuring truth: Headache, by itself, is rarely caused by a tumor.  According to Dr. Kaisorn Chaichana , a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins’ Comprehensive Brain Tumor Center , the chance that your headache is a sign of a brain tumor is very remote.  Headaches are a common occurrence among the general population, but the vast majority of them have nothing to do with cancer.  However, experts recommend that if you experience a new headache, or the pattern changes or becomes more frequent, that is a good reason to visit your primary care doctor to rule out any serious problems.  Brain Cancer Facts   The most common age range for brain tumors in adults is 40 to 60 years old.  Tumors that start in the brain (primary brain tumors) are far less common than tumors that spread to the brain from other areas (metastatic brain tumors).  Some brain tumors do not cause headaches at all, since the brain itself isn’t capable of sensing pain. Only when a tumor is large enough to press on nerves or vessels do they cause headache.   So if a headache is your main complaint and the pattern is staying fairly consistent, chances are you have one of many conditions such as migraine , tension headache , cluster headache or other variety. These headaches can be fiercely painful and disruptive but not life-threatening.  Visit your doctor for new or different headache  If you go to the doctor for headache, he or she will ask you about any recent neurological “red flags” that can signal a serious condition, such as   Seizures  Nausea and vomiting  Numbness  Swelling of the eye or vision problems  Weakness or paralysis, especially on one side of the body  Speech impairment  Personality change   Rest assured  In the absence of these red flags, your doctor will work with you to manage the pain of your headache with medication, diet and lifestyle changes, or a combination of therapies. In most cases x-rays , CAT scans and other diagnostic tests are neither necessary nor even advisable, since they say very little about what’s causing a headache.  Headaches hurt, but there are many approaches that can make them more manageable. And just knowing it’s not likely to be cancer will likely bring you a measure of relief.

Use the menu to see other pages.  A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing a brain tumor. Although risk factors often influence the development of a brain tumor, most do not directly cause a brain tumor. Some people with several risk factors never develop a brain tumor, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed decisions. But, at this time, there are no known ways to prevent a brain tumor through lifestyle changes.  Most of the time, the cause of a brain tumor is unknown, but the following factors may raise a person’s risk of developing a brain tumor:   Age. Brain tumors are more common in children and older adults, although people of any age can develop a brain tumor.    Gender. In general, men are more likely than women to develop a brain tumor. However, some specific types of brain tumors, such as meningioma, are more common in women.    Home and work exposures. Exposure to solvents, pesticides, oil products, rubber, or vinyl chloride may increase the risk of developing a brain tumor. However, there is not yet scientific evidence that supports this possible link.    Family history. About 5% of brain tumors may be linked to hereditary genetic factors or conditions, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome , neurofibromatosis , nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome , tuberous sclerosis , Turcot syndrome , and von Hippel - Lindau disease . Scientists have also found “clusters” of brain tumors within some families without a link to these known hereditary conditions. Studies are underway to try to find a cause for these clusters.    Exposure to infections, viruses, and allergens. Infection with the Epstein - Barr virus (EBV) increases the risk of CNS lymphoma. EBV is more commonly known as the virus that causes mononucleosis or “mono”. In other research, high levels of a common virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been found in brain tumor tissue. The meaning of this finding is being researched. Several types of other viruses have been shown to cause brain tumors in research on animals. More data are needed to find out if exposure to infections, other viruses, or allergens increase the risk of a brain tumor in people. Of note, studies have shown that patients with a history of allergies or skin conditions have a lower risk of glioma.    Electromagnetic fields. Most studies evaluating the role of electromagnetic fields, such as energy from power lines or from cell phone use, show no link to an increased risk of developing a brain tumor in adults. Because of conflicting information regarding risk in children, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting cell phone use and promotes the use of a hands - free headset for both adults and children.    Race and  ethnicity. In the United States, white people are more likely to develop gliomas but less likely to develop meningioma than black people. Also, people from northern Europe are more than twice as likely to develop a brain tumor as people in Japan.    Ionizing radiation. Previous treatment to the brain or head with ionizing radiation, including x - rays, has been shown to be a risk factor for a brain tumor.    Head injury and seizures. Serious head trauma has long been studied for its relationship to brain tumors. Some studies have shown a link between head trauma and meningioma, but not between head trauma and glioma. A history of seizures has long been associated with brain tumors, but because a brain tumor can cause seizures, it is not known if seizures increase the risk of brain tumors, if seizures occur because of the tumor, or if anti-seizure medication increases the risk.    N-nitroso compounds. Some studies of diet and vitamin supplementation seem to indicate that dietary N-nitroso compounds may raise the risk of both childhood and adult brain tumors. Dietary N-nitroso compounds are formed in the body from nitrites or nitrates found in some cured meats, cigarette smoke, and cosmetics. However, additional research is necessary before a definitive link can be established.   The next section in this guide is Symptoms and Signs .

Although many potential causes have been and are being studied, we are still not sure exactly what causes most brain tumors.    Description  Risk factors can be environmental, such as being exposed to certain chemicals at home or work, eating or not eating certain foods, physical activity level, and/or other lifestyle choices such as tobacco and/or alcohol use. They can also be genetic, or based on the characteristics we inherit from our parents.    Environmental Risk Factors  Many studies have been performed on a number of potential environmental risk factors. Of the many factors studied, only one—exposure to ionizing radiation—has been clearly shown to increase the risk of developing brain tumors. Some studies have shown that a history of allergies as an adult, a mother eating fruits and vegetables during pregnancy, eating fruits and vegetables as a child, and having chicken pox as a child have the potential to decrease the risk of developing brain tumor.    It is important to note that it can be difficult to accurately measure environmental exposure, which means that results across studies can be inconsistent. More studies must be performed before we can be sure that certain environmental factors—cured food consumption (nitrites), cigarette smoking, cell phone use, and residential power line exposure, for example—are true risk factors for brain tumors.    Genetic Risk Factors  Anything that refers to the genes can be called “genetic.” However, only about 5 to 10 percent of all cancer is hereditary (ie, passed down from one generation to another in a family). In cases of hereditary brain tumors, a mutation, or change in the DNA sequence that makes up a specific gene, is passed from grandparent to parent to child.    Most genetic risk factors are not inherited at birth, but actually build up over time as we age. Genes are the operating instructions for the whole body. While most of our genes do their jobs as expected, a small number may become inactive or stop working the way they should. This inactivity or malfunctioning can change the way cells grow, which may eventually lead to the development of a tumor.    Brain tumors can also be associated with changes in the chromosomes. Each normal cell in any human body has 23 pairs of chromosomes. The most common chromosomal changes in brain tumors occur on chromosomes 1, 10, 13, 17, 19, and 22. Changes on chromosomes 1 and 19 are most frequently found in oligodendrogliomas and changes on chromosome 22 are most frequently found in meningiomas.    If multiple members of your family have been diagnosed with brain tumors or you have concerns about starting a family, you may want to talk to a genetic counselor. The National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (1-800-422-6237) can help you find a genetic counselor in your area.    Support  Concerns about heredity and brain tumors are common. If you are worried about your family history, begin by sharing it with your family doctor. Although routine screening for brain tumors is not currently available (as it is for breast or cervical cancer, for example), unusual symptoms such as headaches or short-term memory loss can be investigated with your family history in mind.

Primary brain tumors - those that begin in the brain and tend to stay in the brain - occur in people of all ages, but they are statistically more frequent in children and older adults. Metastatic brain tumors - those that begin as a cancer elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain - are more common in adults than children. These numbers address incidence, trends and patterns in the United States only. The facts and statistics include brain and central nervous system tumors (i.e., spinal cord, pituitary and pineal gland tumors). We continually update these statistics, as they become available. This information was last updated in January 2018. We thank the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) for their assistance. These numbers address incidence, trends and patterns in the United States only. For more information, please visit CBTRUS at www.cbtrus.org . By the Numbers: Critical Brain Tumor Statistics   Nearly 80,000 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed this year. Approximately one-third or 32% of brain and CNS tumors are malignant.  This includes more than 25,000 primary malignant and 53,000 non-malignant brain tumors.  There are approximately 700,000 people in the U.S. living with a primary brain and central nervous system tumor.  This year, more than 16,000 people will lose their battle with a primary malignant and central nervous system brain tumor.  Survival after diagnosis with a primary brain tumor varies significantly by age, histology, molecular markers and tumor behavior.  There are more than 120 histologically or molecularly distinct types of primary brain and central nervous system tumors.   Brain Tumor Statistics by Age   The median age at diagnosis for all primary brain tumors is 59 years.  Brain tumors are the most common cancer occurring among those age 0-14, and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children (males and females) age 0-14, according to a 2016 report that places brain tumors in children above leukemia for both statistics.  It is estimated that more than 4,600 children and adolescents between the ages of 0-19 will be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor this year.  Brain and CNS tumors are the third most common cancer occurring among adolescents and young adults (ages 15-39) and the third most common cause of cancer death in this age group.   Tumor-Specific Statistics   Meningioma represents 36.3% of all primary brain tumors, making them the most common primary brain tumor.  There will be an estimated 29,320 new cases in 2018.  Gliomas , a broad term which includes all tumors arising from the gluey or supportive tissue of the brain, represent 26.5% of all primary brain tumors and 80.7% of all malignant tumors.  Glioblastoma represent 14.9% of all primary brain tumors, and 56.1% of all gliomas. Glioblastoma has the highest number of cases of all malignant tumors, with an estimated 12,760 new cases predicted in 2018.  Astrocytomas , including glioblastoma, represent approximately 75.5% of all gliomas.  Nerve sheath tumors (such as acoustic neuromas ) represent about 8.4% of all primary brain tumors.  Pituitary tumors represent nearly 16.2% of all primary brain tumors and rarely become malignant. There will be an estimated 13,210 new cases of pituitary tumors in 2018.  Lymphomas represent 1.4% of all primary brain tumors.  Oligodendrogliomas represent nearly 2% of all primary brain tumors.  Medulloblastoma /embryonal/primitive tumors represent 1% of all primary brain tumors.  The most common site for primary brain and CNS tumors (37%) is within the meninges.

Learn about the Neuro-oncology Center at Roswell Park or consult the links and sources below for more information.  Brain Tumor Facts and Figures  There are approximately 120 different types of brain tumors. These tumors can be malignant or benign. In either case, they can be life threatening due to their effect on brain function.  More than 200,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a brain tumor each year.  Overall, the chance that a person will develop a malignant tumor of the brain or spinal cord in his or her lifetime is less than 1% (about 1 in 150 for men and 1 in 185 for women).  Primary Brain Tumors  Primary brain tumors are tumors that originate in the brain. In the United States, primary brain tumors are among the top ten causes of cancer-related death in women and the eleventh in men.  According to the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS), 79,870 primary, benign and malignant tumors of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) are expected to be diagnosed in 2018.  Approximately 4,200 cases are expected to be diagnosed in people under age 20.  93% of primary brain and CNS tumors are diagnosed in people over 20 years old; people over 85 have the highest incidence. The average age at diagnosis is 57.  Meningiomas are the most common brain tumor in adults, accounting for one out of three primary brain and spinal cord tumors. The risk of developing a meningioma increases with age, and they occur about twice as often in women.  About 3 out of 10 (30%) of all primary brain tumors are gliomas, or a group of tumors that start in the glial cells of the brain. Counting only malignant tumors, about 8 out of 10 (80 percent) are gliomas. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common type of glioma.  Metastatic Brain Tumors  Metastatic brain tumors, or those that originate outside the brain, occur in 20-40% of people with cancer.  Breast, lung, colon, kidney and melanoma cancers are the most common cancers to metastasize to the brain.  Brain Tumors in Children and Young Adults  Brain tumors are the second most common malignancy among children, involving about one out of five pediatric cancer cases (20%).  Brain tumors are the leading cause of solid tumor cancer death in children. They are the second leading cause of cancer death in males up to 39 years of age and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women 20-39 years of age.  The most common types of pediatric tumors are medulloblastomas, low-grade astrocytomas, brain stem gliomas and ependymomas.  Brain Tumor Symptoms  The symptoms of a brain tumor depend on size, type and location. Symptoms may be caused when a tumor presses on a nerve or harms a part of the brain. They may also be caused when a tumor blocks the fluid that flows through and around the brain or when the brain swells because of a buildup of fluid. The most common symptoms of brain tumors are:  Headaches (usually worse in the morning)  Nausea and vomiting  Changes in speech, vision or hearing  Problems balancing or walking  Changes in mood, personality or ability to concentrate  Problems with memory  Muscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions)  Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs  Most often, these symptoms are not due to a brain tumor. Another health problem could cause them. If you have any of these symptoms, it’s important to tell your doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated properly.  Brain Tumor Risk Factors  Researchers are studying whether people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop a brain tumor. Studies have found that ionizing radiation from high-dose x-rays (such as radiation therapy from a large machine aimed at the head) and other sources can cause cell damage that leads to a tumor. People exposed to ionizing radiation may have an increased risk of a brain tumor, such as meningioma or glioma.  Researchers are also studying whether other brain tumor risk factors exist, such as cell phone use, past head injuries or exposure to certain chemicals or magnetic fields. Studies have not shown conclusive proof of these possible risk factors and brain tumors, but additional research is needed.  Family History  It is rare for brain tumors to run in a family. Only a very small number of families have several members with brain tumors.  You can learn more by listening to our brain cancer Roswellness Radio podcast . The podcast features Scott, a childhood leukemia survivor who as an adult had surgery to remove a brain tumor, and Dr. Andrew Fabiano , Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery and Oncology, discussing the various types of brain/spine tumors and how they're treated.

But there are some factors that may increase your risk of developing it.  Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Different cancers have different risk factors.  Having any of these risk factors does not mean that you will definitely develop a brain tumour.  Causes and risks      Age      People can get brain tumours at any age. As we get older our risk of brain tumours increases. But there are many different types of brain tumour and some are more common in younger people.         Medical radiation      Exposure to radiation is the only definite risk factor we know about. But it only accounts for a very small number of brain tumours.  There are many different types of brain tumours. Two types are:  meningiomas  cancerous (malignant) gliomas  These types are more common in people who have had radiotherapy, CT scans or x-rays to the head. Especially those who have had treatments and scans for childhood cancers.  X-rays and CT scans are very important in diagnosing illness so that you have the right treatment. Doctors and dentists keep medical exposure to radiation as low as possible. They are only done when are necessary.  Find out more about x-rays, radiation and your risk of cancer         Previous cancers      People who have had cancer as a child have a higher risk of developing a brain tumour later in life. People who have had leukaemia, non Hodgkin lymphoma or a glioma brain tumour as an adult also have an increased risk.  There is some evidence that there is an increased risk of brain tumours in adults who have had other types of cancer but more research is needed to confirm this.  The increase in brain tumour risk might be due to the treatment for the previous cancer, such as radiotherapy to the head.  Having the chemotherapy drug methotrexate into the fluid around the spinal cord (intrathecal methotrexate) has been shown to increase the risk of brain tumours. Methotrexate is used to treat leukaemia, a type of blood cancer.  Your risk of getting a brain tumour is still small. You would be at a much higher risk from the cancer you are having treatment for if you don't have it.         Family history and genetic conditions      Your risk is higher than other people in the general population if you have a parent, brother or sister diagnosed with a brain tumour.  A small proportion of brain tumours are related to known genetic conditions. People who have one of these rare syndromes have an increased risk of getting a brain tumour.  These syndromes include:  neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 tuberous sclerosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome Turner syndrome Turcot syndrome Gorlin syndrome  Find out more about inherited cancer genes and increased cancer risk history         HIV or AIDS      People with HIV or AIDS have around double the risk of being diagnosed with a brain tumour compared to the general population. This may be related to lowered immunity.         Being overweight      Being overweight or obese increases the risk of some types of brain cancer. Obesity means being very overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. And being overweight is a BMI of between 25 and 30.  Try to keep a healthy weight by being physically active and eating a healthy, balanced diet.  Find out more about obesity and cancer      Cancer controversies Stories about potential causes are often in the media and it isn’t always clear which ideas are supported by evidence. There might be things you have heard of that we haven’t included here. This is because either there is no evidence about them or it is less clear.

Although there are some genetic conditions and environmental factors which may contribute to the development of brain cancer, the risk factors are much less defined for brain cancer than for other cancers in the body.  Also, the risk of developing primary brain cancer is very low. The American Cancer Society estimates the risk over a lifetime is less than one percent.  It’s important to remember that a brain cancer risk factor only affects the probability of developing brain cancer over a lifetime. For example, if you’ve received radiation therapy to treat another cancer, or if you’ve worked in an industry where you handled potentially cancerous chemicals, you may want to discuss with your doctor what it means for your individual risk of developing brain cancer.                   Understanding risk factors  Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer. Not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss it with your doctor.

Getty Images (2) According to the American Brain Tumor Association, about 80,000 men, women, and children were expected to be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor during 2017. ( 1 ) The estimate includes both benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) brain tumors. The American Cancer Society predicts that in 2018, about 23,880 people will be diagnosed with a malignant brain or spinal cord tumor and about 70 percent of those with a malignant tumor will not survive as a result of their diagnosis. ( 2 ) Here’s what you need to know about brain tumor prevalence and survival rates based on the type of brain tumor, age, sex, and race. The Most Prevalent Types of Brain Tumors There are more than 120 known types of brain tumors, with some more prevalent than others. ( 3 ) Of all the types of brain tumors, meningioma, glioma, and glioblastoma are the most common. Meningioma , a tumor that arises from the meninges, represents 36.6 percent of all primary brain tumors, making them the most common primary brain tumor. Most are slow-growing and benign. Glioma, a broad category of tumor that includes all tumors within the gluey or supportive tissue of the brain, accounts for 24.7 percent of all primary brain tumors. Of the malignant brain tumors, 74.6 percent are gliomas. (1) Glioblastomas are a subset of gliomas that arise from astrocytes, or the star-shaped cells in the brain. These tumors represent 14.9 percent of all primary brain tumors and 55.4 percent of all gliomas. Glioblastomas are highly malignant because the cells reproduce quickly and are fed by a large network of blood vessels. ( 4 ) Do Brain Tumors Affect Men and Women Differently? The chance that an individual develops a brain tumor is very small, with a lifetime risk of 1 percent or less. But there is a slight variation in the risk of developing a brain tumor for males and females. (1) According to a study published in 2015 in the journal Cellular and Molecular Life Science , males not only develop more cancers, but they frequently have poorer responses to therapy as measured by overall brain tumor rates and survival rates. ( 5 ) In 2016, an estimated 13,450 men had a brain tumor in comparison to 10,350 women. ( 6 ) It is unclear why men have a predisposition towards developing more cancer; biological factors may describe the differences in rates of brain tumors in a certain sex. According to a study published in Journal of the National Cancer Institute , hormonal differences could result in different prevalence rates between men and women. ( 7 ) “Meningioma is more common in women than men,” says Harmon Eyre, MD, former chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, “probably because this particular tumor has estrogen and progestin receptors.” (6,7) Other cancers and brain tumors, such as Hodgkin lymphoma , occur in more men than women, and professionals are not entirely sure why that’s the case. (7, 8 ) Brain Tumors in Children and Adults Brain tumors can appear differently in children in comparison to adults. The median age for all primary brain tumors is 59, but brain tumors are the most common form of solid tumors among children under age 15, and represent about 20 percent of all childhood cancers. (1, 9 ) It is estimated that more than 4,800 children and adolescents received a diagnosis of primary brain tumor, either benign or malignant, in 2017. Although children of any age may be affected, brain tumors are the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for children up to age 14. (1) The most common brain tumors in children are: Astrocytomas Medulloblastomas Ependymomas Brainstem gliomas ( 10 ) Brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the third most common cancer and third most common cause of cancer death occurring among adolescents and young adults between age 15 and 39. (1) How Many People Survive a Brain Tumor Diagnosis? Survival rates give a general idea of the outlook or prognosis of a certain brain tumor. They provide a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be successful. The risk of developing a brain tumor is quite low. Less than 1 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with a brain or CNS tumor during their lifetime, based on 2010–2014 data on new cases and deaths. ( 11 ) According to the 2016 report by the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, the risk of American males developing a primary malignant brain or CNS tumor is 0.69 percent, and the risk of dying from this diagnosis is 0.51 percent. The risk of females developing a primary malignant brain or CNS tumor is slightly smaller at 0.55 percent, with a 0.41 percent risk of dying. ( 12 ) The five-year relative survival rate, or a comparison of survival rates for those with a brain tumor in the United States versus the survival rate of the overall U.S. population, for those with a brain or CNS tumor is 33.6 percent. In other words, on average, those with a brain or CNS tumor are 33.6 percent as likely to live for at least five years after being diagnosed as those who do not have a brain tumor.

But although the symptoms of most brain tumors are the same, not all tumors are malignant.  In fact, meningioma is the most common brain tumor, accounting for about 30 percent of them. Meningioma tumors are often benign: You may not even need surgery.  Here are five key meningioma facts you need to know:  1. Meningiomas can grow in different places.  These tumors arise from cells in the meninges, the lining of the brain and spinal cord. So technically speaking, they’re not brain tumors at all since they don’t result from mutated brain cells.  But they still grow inside your skull, which means there’s cause for concern. If a meningioma grows or causes swelling that presses against the brain or other structures in the skull, it can cause brain tumor symptoms.  2. Meningioma symptoms depend on their size and location.  Meningiomas present with typical brain tumor symptoms such as headaches, vision problems or seizures. A headache--even a severe one--on its own is seldom a symptom of meningioma or any other brain tumor.  Larger meningiomas can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in hydrocephalus (“water on the brain”) which can affect gait and memory. Other tumor locations can affect your sense of smell, vision, hearing or even the function of your pituitary gland.   3. A meningioma diagnosis may occur when the doctor is looking for something else.  Brain tumor diagnosis is often incidental — that is, the doctor discovers a tumor on a CT or MRI while examining the individual for another reason such as a head injury or another neurologic problem.  When a doctor diagnoses a meningioma, you will get further tests to find out how the tumor is likely to behave. Based on these data, a neurosurgeon will recommend removing the tumor or just watching it to see if it grows.  4. Most meningiomas do not spread.  It can be shocking for someone to be diagnosed with a meningioma — especially a large one — but these tumors are usually benign. This means that the tumor cells are not likely to spread to other parts of the body.  That said, meningiomas can quietly grow for years without causing any problems — and they can get surprisingly large.  5. Meningioma treatment: surgery — or not  Sometimes, believe it or not, your doctor may recommend observation for meningioma, especially if it’s small and not causing problems. You’ll have regular MRIs to check on it.  Otherwise, the main treatment for meningiomas is surgery to remove it, through a craniotomy or other procedure. Your doctor will go over what the operation will involve, the approach to access the tumor and what you can expect afterward.  How does a neurosurgeon operate on a meningioma? It’s all about location. Depending on where the tumor is, each approach will be different. Tumors close to the surface are typically easier to access than those located along the skull base.  Skull base tumors are those located deep in the skull, behind the nose or eyes. These can be challenging, and call for surgeons with skill and expertise in this kind of surgery.  There are a number of new techniques in brain tumor surgery, even for tumors located deep in the skull, and some of these are less invasive.  One system involves a camera-assisted tube that gently moves brain tissue aside so surgeons can reach the tumor with less cutting, so patients can recover faster,  After your treatment you will have regular MRIs to ensure the tumor isn’t returning.  In many cases, it won’t. After 10 years, about 90 percent of patients who have had a meningioma have not seen a recurrence if the tumor is removed completely, including the part of the brain lining from which it grew.  Regardless, the best thing to do if you’re diagnosed with a meningioma or any other tumor is to get the facts, stay informed and work with the most experienced neurosurgeon and care team you can find.

When you are diagnosed with a serious illness, like a spinal cord or brain tumor , learning about survival rates and prognosis for your condition can make you panic even more. But, it’s important to keep in mind that survival rates are simply statistics ; they do not apply to one specific person. Statistics are gathered about a group of patients with a certain disorder, such as a brain tumor, within a certain time frame. In general, to get an accurate statistic it’s necessary to have a relatively large group of people. But spinal cord and brain tumors are very rare forms of cancer, accounting for less than 2 percent of all cancers. This small number of patients makes it difficult for statisticians to gather and analyze information. In addition, there are more than 120 types of brain tumors, making an already difficult job harder. So, while it is important to know about survival rates for spinal cord and brain tumors, don't rely too heavily on the numbers. Your situation may be different. The best source for specific information for your individual prognosis is your own doctor. Have a candid discussion with your doctor about your long-term outlook. Brain Tumor Prognosis: The Stats As you read the rates below, remember that these numbers are not guarantees, but a general idea of the severity of some types of brain tumors. Based on information collected from 2000 to 2004, for people diagnosed with a primary malignant brain and spinal cord tumor (including lymphoma and leukemia , tumors of the pituitary and pineal glands, and tumors of the nose), the five-year survival rates are 28.8 percent for males and 31.6 percent for females. A five-year survival rate refers to the proportion of people who are still alive five years following a diagnosis . When those five-year survival rates were further broken down by age at diagnosis, the relative survival rates were: Age 0 to 19 years: 66.0 percent Age 20 to 24 years: 49.2 percent Age 45 to 54 years: 24.0 percent Age 55 to 64 years: 11.1 percent Age 65 to 74 years: 6.7 percent Age 75 or older: 4.7 percent A relative survival rate refers to survival odds compared with other U.S. citizens within the same category who do not have a malignant tumor. Brain Tumor: Survival Rates for Meningiomas People with meningiomas, the most common form of brain tumor, had a five-year survival rate of 69 percent. When broken down further, survival rate for people with benign (non-cancerous) meningiomas was 70 percent but, for people with malignant (cancerous) meningiomas, the rate was 55 percent. Brain Tumor: Survival Rates for Glioblastomas About 19 percent of all primary brain tumors are glioblastomas, the most common type of cancerous brain tumors. People with glioblastomas had very low relative survival rates: Less than 4 percent lived five years after diagnosis. The survival rate for some children and adolescents may be up to 25 percent if surgery is effective, but since this is not common, most children with glioblastomas have the same odds as adults. Brain Tumor: Gender and Race As a rule, men get more brain tumors than women, for reasons that are not clear. But, women get more tumors of certain types. Women get three times as many tumors of the meninges (the tissues that cover the spinal cord and brain) as men. Olfactory tumors of the naval cavity are slightly more common in women. Tumors of the cranial nerves (which carry messages between the brain and body parts) are also slightly more common in women. Tumors of the pituitary gland (which helps regulate the thyroid) occur in about 12 percent more women than men. Overall, Caucasians get more brain tumors, such as glioblastoma, than African-Americans; about twice as many. But African-Americans get more tumors of the meninges. The cause of this disparity is not known. Reasons to be Hopeful There are good reasons to be hopeful about the prognosis for spinal cord and brain tumors. Brain tumors are an important research topic; a search on the National Cancer Institute’s Web site for adult glioblastoma clinical trials turned up 249 trials that are recruiting patients. Progress is also being made in the operating room. “Because of new techniques and technology, neurosurgeons can see, reach, and remove tumors that we could never reach before,” says Andrew Sloan, MD, director of the Brain Tumor and Neuro-oncology Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. “We are making a great deal of progress.” Brain Tumor: More Information A good source for spinal cord and brain tumor survival rates is the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (SEER) Cancer Statistics Review (CSR) , which reports statistics regarding cancer and is published annually by the Cancer Statistics Branch of the National Cancer Institute.

They tell you what portion of people with the same type of tumor are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.  What is a 5-year survival rate?  The 5-year survival rate is the percentage of people who live at least 5 years after being diagnosed. For example, a 5-year survival rate of 70% means that an estimated 70 out of 100 people who have that type of tumor are still alive 5 years after being diagnosed. Keep in mind, however, that many of these people live much longer than 5 years.  Relative survival rates (like the numbers below) are a more accurate way to estimate the effect of cancer on survival. These rates compare people with cancer to people in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival rate for a specific type of tumor is 70%, it would mean that people who have that type of tumor are, on average, about 70% as likely as people who don’t have that tumor to live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed.  But remember, the 5-year relative survival rates are estimates – your outlook can vary based on a number of factors specific to you.  Survival rates don’t tell the whole story  Survival rates are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had the disease, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. There are some limitations to remember:   Thesenumbers are among the most current available. But to get 5-year survival rates, doctors have to look at people who were treated at least 5 years ago. As treatments are improving over time, people who are now being diagnosed with brain or spinal cord tumors may have a better outlook than these statistics show.  The outlook for people with brain or spinal cord tumors varies by the type of tumor and the person’s age. But many other factors can also affect a person’s outlook, such as their age and overall health, where the tumor is located, and how well the tumor responds to treatment. The outlook for each person is specific to their circumstances.   Your doctor can tell you how these numbers may apply to you, as he or she is familiar with your situation.  Survival rates for more common adult brain and spinal cord tumors  The numbers in the table come from the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) and are based on people who were treated between 2000 and 2014.
     As can be seen below, survival rates for brain and spinal cord tumors can vary widely by age, with younger people tending to have having better outlooks than older people. The survival rates for those 65 or older are generally lower than the rates for the ages listed below.  These numbers are for some of the more common types of brain and spinal cord tumors. Numbers are not readily available for all types of tumors, often because they are rare or are hard to classify.

Getty Images (2) According to the American Brain Tumor Association, about 80,000 men, women, and children were expected to be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor during 2017. ( 1 ) The estimate includes both benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) brain tumors. The American Cancer Society predicts that in 2018, about 23,880 people will be diagnosed with a malignant brain or spinal cord tumor and about 70 percent of those with a malignant tumor will not survive as a result of their diagnosis. ( 2 ) Here’s what you need to know about brain tumor prevalence and survival rates based on the type of brain tumor, age, sex, and race. The Most Prevalent Types of Brain Tumors There are more than 120 known types of brain tumors, with some more prevalent than others. ( 3 ) Of all the types of brain tumors, meningioma, glioma, and glioblastoma are the most common. Meningioma , a tumor that arises from the meninges, represents 36.6 percent of all primary brain tumors, making them the most common primary brain tumor. Most are slow-growing and benign. Glioma, a broad category of tumor that includes all tumors within the gluey or supportive tissue of the brain, accounts for 24.7 percent of all primary brain tumors. Of the malignant brain tumors, 74.6 percent are gliomas. (1) Glioblastomas are a subset of gliomas that arise from astrocytes, or the star-shaped cells in the brain. These tumors represent 14.9 percent of all primary brain tumors and 55.4 percent of all gliomas. Glioblastomas are highly malignant because the cells reproduce quickly and are fed by a large network of blood vessels. ( 4 ) Do Brain Tumors Affect Men and Women Differently? The chance that an individual develops a brain tumor is very small, with a lifetime risk of 1 percent or less. But there is a slight variation in the risk of developing a brain tumor for males and females. (1) According to a study published in 2015 in the journal Cellular and Molecular Life Science , males not only develop more cancers, but they frequently have poorer responses to therapy as measured by overall brain tumor rates and survival rates. ( 5 ) In 2016, an estimated 13,450 men had a brain tumor in comparison to 10,350 women. ( 6 ) It is unclear why men have a predisposition towards developing more cancer; biological factors may describe the differences in rates of brain tumors in a certain sex. According to a study published in Journal of the National Cancer Institute , hormonal differences could result in different prevalence rates between men and women. ( 7 ) “Meningioma is more common in women than men,” says Harmon Eyre, MD, former chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, “probably because this particular tumor has estrogen and progestin receptors.” (6,7) Other cancers and brain tumors, such as Hodgkin lymphoma , occur in more men than women, and professionals are not entirely sure why that’s the case. (7, 8 ) Brain Tumors in Children and Adults Brain tumors can appear differently in children in comparison to adults. The median age for all primary brain tumors is 59, but brain tumors are the most common form of solid tumors among children under age 15, and represent about 20 percent of all childhood cancers. (1, 9 ) It is estimated that more than 4,800 children and adolescents received a diagnosis of primary brain tumor, either benign or malignant, in 2017. Although children of any age may be affected, brain tumors are the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for children up to age 14. (1) The most common brain tumors in children are: Astrocytomas Medulloblastomas Ependymomas Brainstem gliomas ( 10 ) Brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the third most common cancer and third most common cause of cancer death occurring among adolescents and young adults between age 15 and 39. (1) How Many People Survive a Brain Tumor Diagnosis? Survival rates give a general idea of the outlook or prognosis of a certain brain tumor. They provide a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be successful. The risk of developing a brain tumor is quite low. Less than 1 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with a brain or CNS tumor during their lifetime, based on 2010–2014 data on new cases and deaths. ( 11 ) According to the 2016 report by the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, the risk of American males developing a primary malignant brain or CNS tumor is 0.69 percent, and the risk of dying from this diagnosis is 0.51 percent. The risk of females developing a primary malignant brain or CNS tumor is slightly smaller at 0.55 percent, with a 0.41 percent risk of dying. ( 12 ) The five-year relative survival rate, or a comparison of survival rates for those with a brain tumor in the United States versus the survival rate of the overall U.S. population, for those with a brain or CNS tumor is 33.6 percent. In other words, on average, those with a brain or CNS tumor are 33.6 percent as likely to live for at least five years after being diagnosed as those who do not have a brain tumor.

Although there are some genetic conditions and environmental factors which may contribute to the development of brain cancer, the risk factors are much less defined for brain cancer than for other cancers in the body.  Also, the risk of developing primary brain cancer is very low. The American Cancer Society estimates the risk over a lifetime is less than one percent.  It’s important to remember that a brain cancer risk factor only affects the probability of developing brain cancer over a lifetime. For example, if you’ve received radiation therapy to treat another cancer, or if you’ve worked in an industry where you handled potentially cancerous chemicals, you may want to discuss with your doctor what it means for your individual risk of developing brain cancer.                   Understanding risk factors  Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer. Not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss it with your doctor.

Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults  About Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults             Key Statistics for Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors       The American Cancer Society’s estimates for brain and spinal cord tumors in the United States for 2018 include both adults and children .   About 23,880 malignant tumors of the brain or spinal cord (13,720 in males and 10,160 in females) will be diagnosed. These numbers would be much higher if benign (non-cancer) tumors were also included.  About 16,830 people (9,490 males and 7,340 females) will die from brain and spinal cord tumors.   Overall, the chance that a person will develop a malignant tumor of the brain or spinal cord in his or her lifetime is less than 1%. The risk for men (about 1 in 143) is slightly higher than that for women (about 1 in 185),
      although certain types of tumors are more common in women.  Survival rates for brain and spinal cord tumors vary widely, depending on the type of tumor (and other factors ). Rates for some of the more common types of brain and spinal cord tumors are discussed in Survival Rates for Selected Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors .

A bad headache can be scary. It’s hard not to think the worst if you’re unlucky enough to suffer with severe headaches . If the pain lasts or recurs, you may wonder if you have a serious problem such as a brain tumor .  Headache: Brain tumor is an uncommon cause  Here’s the reassuring truth: Headache, by itself, is rarely caused by a tumor.  According to Dr. Kaisorn Chaichana , a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins’ Comprehensive Brain Tumor Center , the chance that your headache is a sign of a brain tumor is very remote.  Headaches are a common occurrence among the general population, but the vast majority of them have nothing to do with cancer.  However, experts recommend that if you experience a new headache, or the pattern changes or becomes more frequent, that is a good reason to visit your primary care doctor to rule out any serious problems.  Brain Cancer Facts   The most common age range for brain tumors in adults is 40 to 60 years old.  Tumors that start in the brain (primary brain tumors) are far less common than tumors that spread to the brain from other areas (metastatic brain tumors).  Some brain tumors do not cause headaches at all, since the brain itself isn’t capable of sensing pain. Only when a tumor is large enough to press on nerves or vessels do they cause headache.   So if a headache is your main complaint and the pattern is staying fairly consistent, chances are you have one of many conditions such as migraine , tension headache , cluster headache or other variety. These headaches can be fiercely painful and disruptive but not life-threatening.  Visit your doctor for new or different headache  If you go to the doctor for headache, he or she will ask you about any recent neurological “red flags” that can signal a serious condition, such as   Seizures  Nausea and vomiting  Numbness  Swelling of the eye or vision problems  Weakness or paralysis, especially on one side of the body  Speech impairment  Personality change   Rest assured  In the absence of these red flags, your doctor will work with you to manage the pain of your headache with medication, diet and lifestyle changes, or a combination of therapies. In most cases x-rays , CAT scans and other diagnostic tests are neither necessary nor even advisable, since they say very little about what’s causing a headache.  Headaches hurt, but there are many approaches that can make them more manageable. And just knowing it’s not likely to be cancer will likely bring you a measure of relief.

Use the menu to see other pages.  A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing a brain tumor. Although risk factors often influence the development of a brain tumor, most do not directly cause a brain tumor. Some people with several risk factors never develop a brain tumor, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed decisions. But, at this time, there are no known ways to prevent a brain tumor through lifestyle changes.  Most of the time, the cause of a brain tumor is unknown, but the following factors may raise a person’s risk of developing a brain tumor:   Age. Brain tumors are more common in children and older adults, although people of any age can develop a brain tumor.    Gender. In general, men are more likely than women to develop a brain tumor. However, some specific types of brain tumors, such as meningioma, are more common in women.    Home and work exposures. Exposure to solvents, pesticides, oil products, rubber, or vinyl chloride may increase the risk of developing a brain tumor. However, there is not yet scientific evidence that supports this possible link.    Family history. About 5% of brain tumors may be linked to hereditary genetic factors or conditions, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome , neurofibromatosis , nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome , tuberous sclerosis , Turcot syndrome , and von Hippel - Lindau disease . Scientists have also found “clusters” of brain tumors within some families without a link to these known hereditary conditions. Studies are underway to try to find a cause for these clusters.    Exposure to infections, viruses, and allergens. Infection with the Epstein - Barr virus (EBV) increases the risk of CNS lymphoma. EBV is more commonly known as the virus that causes mononucleosis or “mono”. In other research, high levels of a common virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been found in brain tumor tissue. The meaning of this finding is being researched. Several types of other viruses have been shown to cause brain tumors in research on animals. More data are needed to find out if exposure to infections, other viruses, or allergens increase the risk of a brain tumor in people. Of note, studies have shown that patients with a history of allergies or skin conditions have a lower risk of glioma.    Electromagnetic fields. Most studies evaluating the role of electromagnetic fields, such as energy from power lines or from cell phone use, show no link to an increased risk of developing a brain tumor in adults. Because of conflicting information regarding risk in children, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting cell phone use and promotes the use of a hands - free headset for both adults and children.    Race and  ethnicity. In the United States, white people are more likely to develop gliomas but less likely to develop meningioma than black people. Also, people from northern Europe are more than twice as likely to develop a brain tumor as people in Japan.    Ionizing radiation. Previous treatment to the brain or head with ionizing radiation, including x - rays, has been shown to be a risk factor for a brain tumor.    Head injury and seizures. Serious head trauma has long been studied for its relationship to brain tumors. Some studies have shown a link between head trauma and meningioma, but not between head trauma and glioma. A history of seizures has long been associated with brain tumors, but because a brain tumor can cause seizures, it is not known if seizures increase the risk of brain tumors, if seizures occur because of the tumor, or if anti-seizure medication increases the risk.    N-nitroso compounds. Some studies of diet and vitamin supplementation seem to indicate that dietary N-nitroso compounds may raise the risk of both childhood and adult brain tumors. Dietary N-nitroso compounds are formed in the body from nitrites or nitrates found in some cured meats, cigarette smoke, and cosmetics. However, additional research is necessary before a definitive link can be established.   The next section in this guide is Symptoms and Signs .

Although many potential causes have been and are being studied, we are still not sure exactly what causes most brain tumors.    Description  Risk factors can be environmental, such as being exposed to certain chemicals at home or work, eating or not eating certain foods, physical activity level, and/or other lifestyle choices such as tobacco and/or alcohol use. They can also be genetic, or based on the characteristics we inherit from our parents.    Environmental Risk Factors  Many studies have been performed on a number of potential environmental risk factors. Of the many factors studied, only one—exposure to ionizing radiation—has been clearly shown to increase the risk of developing brain tumors. Some studies have shown that a history of allergies as an adult, a mother eating fruits and vegetables during pregnancy, eating fruits and vegetables as a child, and having chicken pox as a child have the potential to decrease the risk of developing brain tumor.    It is important to note that it can be difficult to accurately measure environmental exposure, which means that results across studies can be inconsistent. More studies must be performed before we can be sure that certain environmental factors—cured food consumption (nitrites), cigarette smoking, cell phone use, and residential power line exposure, for example—are true risk factors for brain tumors.    Genetic Risk Factors  Anything that refers to the genes can be called “genetic.” However, only about 5 to 10 percent of all cancer is hereditary (ie, passed down from one generation to another in a family). In cases of hereditary brain tumors, a mutation, or change in the DNA sequence that makes up a specific gene, is passed from grandparent to parent to child.    Most genetic risk factors are not inherited at birth, but actually build up over time as we age. Genes are the operating instructions for the whole body. While most of our genes do their jobs as expected, a small number may become inactive or stop working the way they should. This inactivity or malfunctioning can change the way cells grow, which may eventually lead to the development of a tumor.    Brain tumors can also be associated with changes in the chromosomes. Each normal cell in any human body has 23 pairs of chromosomes. The most common chromosomal changes in brain tumors occur on chromosomes 1, 10, 13, 17, 19, and 22. Changes on chromosomes 1 and 19 are most frequently found in oligodendrogliomas and changes on chromosome 22 are most frequently found in meningiomas.    If multiple members of your family have been diagnosed with brain tumors or you have concerns about starting a family, you may want to talk to a genetic counselor. The National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (1-800-422-6237) can help you find a genetic counselor in your area.    Support  Concerns about heredity and brain tumors are common. If you are worried about your family history, begin by sharing it with your family doctor. Although routine screening for brain tumors is not currently available (as it is for breast or cervical cancer, for example), unusual symptoms such as headaches or short-term memory loss can be investigated with your family history in mind.

Primary brain tumors - those that begin in the brain and tend to stay in the brain - occur in people of all ages, but they are statistically more frequent in children and older adults. Metastatic brain tumors - those that begin as a cancer elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain - are more common in adults than children. These numbers address incidence, trends and patterns in the United States only. The facts and statistics include brain and central nervous system tumors (i.e., spinal cord, pituitary and pineal gland tumors). We continually update these statistics, as they become available. This information was last updated in January 2018. We thank the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) for their assistance. These numbers address incidence, trends and patterns in the United States only. For more information, please visit CBTRUS at www.cbtrus.org . By the Numbers: Critical Brain Tumor Statistics   Nearly 80,000 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed this year. Approximately one-third or 32% of brain and CNS tumors are malignant.  This includes more than 25,000 primary malignant and 53,000 non-malignant brain tumors.  There are approximately 700,000 people in the U.S. living with a primary brain and central nervous system tumor.  This year, more than 16,000 people will lose their battle with a primary malignant and central nervous system brain tumor.  Survival after diagnosis with a primary brain tumor varies significantly by age, histology, molecular markers and tumor behavior.  There are more than 120 histologically or molecularly distinct types of primary brain and central nervous system tumors.   Brain Tumor Statistics by Age   The median age at diagnosis for all primary brain tumors is 59 years.  Brain tumors are the most common cancer occurring among those age 0-14, and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children (males and females) age 0-14, according to a 2016 report that places brain tumors in children above leukemia for both statistics.  It is estimated that more than 4,600 children and adolescents between the ages of 0-19 will be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor this year.  Brain and CNS tumors are the third most common cancer occurring among adolescents and young adults (ages 15-39) and the third most common cause of cancer death in this age group.   Tumor-Specific Statistics   Meningioma represents 36.3% of all primary brain tumors, making them the most common primary brain tumor.  There will be an estimated 29,320 new cases in 2018.  Gliomas , a broad term which includes all tumors arising from the gluey or supportive tissue of the brain, represent 26.5% of all primary brain tumors and 80.7% of all malignant tumors.  Glioblastoma represent 14.9% of all primary brain tumors, and 56.1% of all gliomas. Glioblastoma has the highest number of cases of all malignant tumors, with an estimated 12,760 new cases predicted in 2018.  Astrocytomas , including glioblastoma, represent approximately 75.5% of all gliomas.  Nerve sheath tumors (such as acoustic neuromas ) represent about 8.4% of all primary brain tumors.  Pituitary tumors represent nearly 16.2% of all primary brain tumors and rarely become malignant. There will be an estimated 13,210 new cases of pituitary tumors in 2018.  Lymphomas represent 1.4% of all primary brain tumors.  Oligodendrogliomas represent nearly 2% of all primary brain tumors.  Medulloblastoma /embryonal/primitive tumors represent 1% of all primary brain tumors.  The most common site for primary brain and CNS tumors (37%) is within the meninges.

Learn about the Neuro-oncology Center at Roswell Park or consult the links and sources below for more information.  Brain Tumor Facts and Figures  There are approximately 120 different types of brain tumors. These tumors can be malignant or benign. In either case, they can be life threatening due to their effect on brain function.  More than 200,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a brain tumor each year.  Overall, the chance that a person will develop a malignant tumor of the brain or spinal cord in his or her lifetime is less than 1% (about 1 in 150 for men and 1 in 185 for women).  Primary Brain Tumors  Primary brain tumors are tumors that originate in the brain. In the United States, primary brain tumors are among the top ten causes of cancer-related death in women and the eleventh in men.  According to the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS), 79,870 primary, benign and malignant tumors of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) are expected to be diagnosed in 2018.  Approximately 4,200 cases are expected to be diagnosed in people under age 20.  93% of primary brain and CNS tumors are diagnosed in people over 20 years old; people over 85 have the highest incidence. The average age at diagnosis is 57.  Meningiomas are the most common brain tumor in adults, accounting for one out of three primary brain and spinal cord tumors. The risk of developing a meningioma increases with age, and they occur about twice as often in women.  About 3 out of 10 (30%) of all primary brain tumors are gliomas, or a group of tumors that start in the glial cells of the brain. Counting only malignant tumors, about 8 out of 10 (80 percent) are gliomas. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common type of glioma.  Metastatic Brain Tumors  Metastatic brain tumors, or those that originate outside the brain, occur in 20-40% of people with cancer.  Breast, lung, colon, kidney and melanoma cancers are the most common cancers to metastasize to the brain.  Brain Tumors in Children and Young Adults  Brain tumors are the second most common malignancy among children, involving about one out of five pediatric cancer cases (20%).  Brain tumors are the leading cause of solid tumor cancer death in children. They are the second leading cause of cancer death in males up to 39 years of age and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women 20-39 years of age.  The most common types of pediatric tumors are medulloblastomas, low-grade astrocytomas, brain stem gliomas and ependymomas.  Brain Tumor Symptoms  The symptoms of a brain tumor depend on size, type and location. Symptoms may be caused when a tumor presses on a nerve or harms a part of the brain. They may also be caused when a tumor blocks the fluid that flows through and around the brain or when the brain swells because of a buildup of fluid. The most common symptoms of brain tumors are:  Headaches (usually worse in the morning)  Nausea and vomiting  Changes in speech, vision or hearing  Problems balancing or walking  Changes in mood, personality or ability to concentrate  Problems with memory  Muscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions)  Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs  Most often, these symptoms are not due to a brain tumor. Another health problem could cause them. If you have any of these symptoms, it’s important to tell your doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated properly.  Brain Tumor Risk Factors  Researchers are studying whether people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop a brain tumor. Studies have found that ionizing radiation from high-dose x-rays (such as radiation therapy from a large machine aimed at the head) and other sources can cause cell damage that leads to a tumor. People exposed to ionizing radiation may have an increased risk of a brain tumor, such as meningioma or glioma.  Researchers are also studying whether other brain tumor risk factors exist, such as cell phone use, past head injuries or exposure to certain chemicals or magnetic fields. Studies have not shown conclusive proof of these possible risk factors and brain tumors, but additional research is needed.  Family History  It is rare for brain tumors to run in a family. Only a very small number of families have several members with brain tumors.  You can learn more by listening to our brain cancer Roswellness Radio podcast . The podcast features Scott, a childhood leukemia survivor who as an adult had surgery to remove a brain tumor, and Dr. Andrew Fabiano , Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery and Oncology, discussing the various types of brain/spine tumors and how they're treated.

But there are some factors that may increase your risk of developing it.  Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Different cancers have different risk factors.  Having any of these risk factors does not mean that you will definitely develop a brain tumour.  Causes and risks      Age      People can get brain tumours at any age. As we get older our risk of brain tumours increases. But there are many different types of brain tumour and some are more common in younger people.         Medical radiation      Exposure to radiation is the only definite risk factor we know about. But it only accounts for a very small number of brain tumours.  There are many different types of brain tumours. Two types are:  meningiomas  cancerous (malignant) gliomas  These types are more common in people who have had radiotherapy, CT scans or x-rays to the head. Especially those who have had treatments and scans for childhood cancers.  X-rays and CT scans are very important in diagnosing illness so that you have the right treatment. Doctors and dentists keep medical exposure to radiation as low as possible. They are only done when are necessary.  Find out more about x-rays, radiation and your risk of cancer         Previous cancers      People who have had cancer as a child have a higher risk of developing a brain tumour later in life. People who have had leukaemia, non Hodgkin lymphoma or a glioma brain tumour as an adult also have an increased risk.  There is some evidence that there is an increased risk of brain tumours in adults who have had other types of cancer but more research is needed to confirm this.  The increase in brain tumour risk might be due to the treatment for the previous cancer, such as radiotherapy to the head.  Having the chemotherapy drug methotrexate into the fluid around the spinal cord (intrathecal methotrexate) has been shown to increase the risk of brain tumours. Methotrexate is used to treat leukaemia, a type of blood cancer.  Your risk of getting a brain tumour is still small. You would be at a much higher risk from the cancer you are having treatment for if you don't have it.         Family history and genetic conditions      Your risk is higher than other people in the general population if you have a parent, brother or sister diagnosed with a brain tumour.  A small proportion of brain tumours are related to known genetic conditions. People who have one of these rare syndromes have an increased risk of getting a brain tumour.  These syndromes include:  neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 tuberous sclerosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome Turner syndrome Turcot syndrome Gorlin syndrome  Find out more about inherited cancer genes and increased cancer risk history         HIV or AIDS      People with HIV or AIDS have around double the risk of being diagnosed with a brain tumour compared to the general population. This may be related to lowered immunity.         Being overweight      Being overweight or obese increases the risk of some types of brain cancer. Obesity means being very overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. And being overweight is a BMI of between 25 and 30.  Try to keep a healthy weight by being physically active and eating a healthy, balanced diet.  Find out more about obesity and cancer      Cancer controversies Stories about potential causes are often in the media and it isn’t always clear which ideas are supported by evidence. There might be things you have heard of that we haven’t included here. This is because either there is no evidence about them or it is less clear.
