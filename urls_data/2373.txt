One in 10? One in 50? One in 100? If you're over 62, your odds of having at least $1 million in net wealth (your total assets minus your total debt) are relatively achievable — about 1 in 7. But if you are under 40, your odds are low: 1 in 55. In the last 25 years, the odds that an old person is a millionaire have improved slightly. But for young people, they have gotten much worse. These figures come from a new paper by economists at the St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability, which shows evidence of a growing wealth gap that few people are talking about — the gap between the young and the old. The paper, by William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, draws on surveys of 40,000 families that the Fed carried out between 1989 and 2013 to examine the all-important role that your age plays in how much income you make and how much wealth you accumulate. It offers a few clues as to how young people can game the system and end up like their wealthy older counterparts, as well as a lot of evidence to show that things are just different for young people today. One of the most important points that the paper makes is that everyone's income and wealth tend to follow a kind of natural pattern during their life. Young people (generally defined here as those under 40) haven't been working for many years, so they don't have an opportunity to save as much; they also need to make investments in things like education and new home ownership. Middle-aged people (40-61) have been working long enough that they start to accumulate wealth rapidly. And old people (62 and up) begin to draw down on their wealth, to finance their retirement. You can see these trends in this incredible graph below, from their paper. People born in different years (1901, 1904, 1907 and so on) were surveyed at various times between 1989 and 2013 about their median family income. The chart below shows their age on the horizontal axis, and the median family income they reported making at the time on the vertical axis. The slope of each of the different colored lines shows how income was changing for that group between 1989 and 2013. For example, for the youngest generations, who appear on the left-hand side of the graph, the lines sharply slope upward because their net income is rising. World Economic Forum Here's the same graph for wealth (assets minus debt), rather than income. If you compare this with the previous chart, you can see that net worth takes a longer time to amass than income, and then declines less slowly. That's partly because a lot of people take on debt at the beginning of their lives — student debt, mortgages, etc — and thus have negative net worth. It's also because people lose their incomes as they retire, but tend to hold on to their largest sources of net worth, like their homes. World Economic Forum From bad to worse Basically, young people have always been poor. But looking beyond that basic trend, you can see that today's young people are poorer than young people of the past. The period of time in which someone is born can also have a dramatic effect on their wealth compared with other generations. The winners of this historical jackpot appear to be those who were born between 1930 and 1945 and came of age after World War II, who are sometimes called The Silent Generation. Both the Silent Generation and the generation that came before them, called The Greatest Generation because they fought in World War II, benefited from America's rapid economic growth after World War II. (As Thomas Piketty describes in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, this was not necessarily a happy story: The U.S. grew so fast after World War II because it was the only place in the world with manufacturing capacity - Europe had literally been leveled.) But The Silent Generation appears to get an additional boost because they were born during the Great Depression, a time when people had fewer babies overall. Their lower population meant that they had less competition overall for jobs, housing, investments and other opportunities. Sociologist Elwood Carlson called the generation "the lucky few" because they were smaller than the generation that came before. African-Americans and women born in those years had far more opportunity, and the generation also benefited from the expansion of the American safety net, including Social Security and Medicare, during their lives. YouTube/The Pilion Trust Charity "People born in the first half of the 20th century simply may have been in the right place at the right time as they were lifted by a rising tide," the economists write. Then came the Baby Boomers, the populous generation born after World War II. They haven't fared as well as their predecessors, in part because their greater numbers have meant more competition, and perhaps in part because the world is just a different place. The Boomers were the first generation to really experience the effects of globalization and competition from workers in the developing world. That, as well as automation and the decline of labor unions have all eroded wage growth on the lower end of the income spectrum. The charts below illustrate this difference. A sliver of the Greatest Generation, born in 1915-1917, is represented on the far right side of both graphs in teal. Part of the Silent Generation (born 1933-1935) appears in cornflower blue, while some Boomers (born 1954-1956) appear in beige. The horizontal axis shows the person's age, and the vertical axis shows their income (on the left) or median net worth (on the right). If you look at Figure 3 on the right, you can see how much better the Silent Generation did than the generations that came before or after them. Notice where the blue line overlaps with the teal line — that shows that those born between 1933 and 1935 had a much higher net worth in their 70's than those born between 1915 and 1917. In the same graph, the overlap between the blue line and the beige line shows that the Silent Generation also had a higher net worth than the Boomers did when both generations were in their mid to late 50's. World Economic Forum William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability In just 25 years, the wealth gap between young and old people has yawned wider. In 1989, old families had 7.6 times as much median wealth as young families. By 2013, it had grown to 14.7 times. According to the economists' calculations, someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than an identical person born in 1940. It's not clear exactly why this is, the economists say. The financial crisis and Great Recession certainly set young people back, but young people were doing comparatively worse even before that. And the trends are true even though America's younger generations are its most educated ever. Part of the reason could be that younger Americans are far more diverse than older generations, and race- and ethnicity-based disadvantages continue to loom large in the U.S., the economists say. White and Asian families are far wealthier than black and Hispanic families in the U.S., across all age groups. Flickr The difference may also be due to the difference in financial decisions between young and old people. Old people generally have more diverse investments, carry less debt and are more cushioned against financial shocks than younger people. If young people want to increase their chances of being wealthy, one strategy is to emulate the behavior of older people: keeping an emergency fund, paying down debt, avoiding high-cost credit, and putting money into higher-returning investments, the economists say. One strategy that might work for young people is delaying the purchase of a house. By doing so, young people can save and make a bigger down payment later, and thus lower their debt burden, as well as make more diverse investments in the interim. But even if Millennials and Gen Xers follow these strategies, the historical trends don't appear to be on their side. "Some people are just born lucky," the economists conclude.

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 — yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes! Binazir concludes that the odds of you being alive are basically zero . visual.ly SEE ALSO: See How The Most Popular Baby Names Have Changed Over Time >    More:  Baby  Science  Parents and Kids      facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link           Recommended For You   Powered By Sailthru              Powered By Sailthru                       Follow us on:                  Also check out:           * Copyright © 2018 Business Insider Inc.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don’t matter. The fact you’re alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you…   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let’s remember there are people out there that can’t eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don’t feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that “it” may be. Unfortunately, people aren’t grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don’t have. When you see regret in a person’s eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn’t. No matter the shit hand you’re dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don’t care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you’re actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.” - Carl Sagan  The odds of getting struck by lightning during your lifetime are about 1 in 12,000. The odds of a professional soccer player getting bitten by Uruguay’s Luis Suarez are about 1 in 2,000. But what are the odds of you turning out to be exactly you?  While this explanation does make a fair amount of assumptions, take a look at some of the incredible ways that conditions in the universe came together to make you exactly you.

Undo Answer Wiki 8 Answers   Fernando Oettinger , Architecture Assessor at Municipalidad De Valdivia (2017-present) Updated Jan 8, 2018 · Author has 245 answers and 245.2k answer views This is actually quite an interesting question. To know this you would need to know how many living creatures are born on the whole planet on a determined lapse of time. We would need an experienced team of biologists to come up with an educated estimation. You have to weigh in all humans, all animal, al insects, all plants, all bateria. That is the hard part. The easy part is just adding up the results and calculate the probabilities. Since the numbers here would be massive, you would probbably have to work in units per second. I don’t know the results but I’d assume the it would be quite a bit like this: 85% chance of being born a bacteria. 7% chance of being born as a plant. 6% chance of being born as an insect. 1.99999% chance of being born as any animal. 0.00001% chance of being born a human. This is every second. Now have in mind that this came out my mind. For accurate result an exhaustive survey should be done and that would be excruciating work. 1.8k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below What is the probability of being born? Why is the probability for humans to be born as a boy about 50%? What is the probability of me being born? How important is being born as a human? What is the purpose of humans being born? Ask New Question   Joe Doe Updated Jan 10, 2018 Nobody knows the precise probability, but it’s definitely almost Infinitely miniature. We would not be around if just one of the following processes hadn’t occurred (each event exponentially less likely to have occured than the event prior to it): Your dad and mom decided to mate at the exact period of time they did. A male is constantly replacing millions of his sperm a day, so if your parents decided to mate a few months post/prior than they did, most likely, a different sperm would’ve met your mother’s egg, and you wouldn’t be born. Even using the fact that they DID mate at the time they did, there were millions of sperm released when they mated, and it had to be the EXACT right one out of millions sperm, with the EXACT right one of ~300,000 eggs from your mom. (Chance of birth is already extraordinary small, and we’re just getting started). The above process applied to your four grandparents…and your eight great-grandparents…and your sixteen great-great-grandparents…and all the way down your ~3.9 billion years of ancestral line. If just ONE of those ancestors died/didn’t have kids for whatever reason, you wouldn’t be born, meaning those exact environmental pressures/ecological events had to occur throughout the history of life on Earth. The right chemicals were at the right place, in the right time, to create some form of biological reaction - the origin of life on Earth (notice I didn’t say on which planet/object this process took place). Large amounts of rock came together to form a more massive ball, which happened to be in the habitable zone of our sun; the ball now known as the Earth. In some nebula far far away, a random mass of some hydrogen and helium had come together, to form the star we now know as our sun ~5 billion years ago. The creation of the sun’s birth nebula. (It’s still unknown to scientists exactly which nebula gave birth to our sun). The big bang. If the universe had never been created, then (quite obviously) the world as we know it wouldn’t have existed. Who knows the probability of the big bang’s occurrence; to this day, nobody knows how the big bang was formed… So that gives you a perspective of how unlikely you are to be born-as a human. You could always look at it another way, however. You’d only know if you existed, and wouldn’t know if you weren’t alive. Therefore, in your realm of consciousness, you’d have a 100% chance of being born. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by TruthFinder If you're looking for arrest records this is a leading source.

Existence is like the lottery nobody should win - actually its winners are the real losers. The real winners are the vast majority who will never be cursed with the unfortunate state of existence. Life is horrible and it would have been better for all living things (both human and nonhuman) to have never existed. 481 Views · View Upvoters   Christopher Varga , Avid reader of scientific publications Answered Jul 28, 2017 · Author has 296 answers and 30.9k answer views I don’t exactly understand the questions. Are you asking what is the probability that a fertilized human ovum will result in a live birth? If so, the answer is estimated at 50% to 70%. It’s almost impossible to know exactly, because many times zygotes fail and are expelled by the body before a woman even knows a conception has occurred. 684 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Boomerang for Gmail Ever wonder how your emails are coming across?

Undo Answer Wiki 20 Answers   Mark Garrett , PhD in Electrical Engineering, Columbia University Answered Aug 16, 2017 · Author has 415 answers and 149.8k answer views What is incorrect about this statement is the notion that a probability is either “correct” or “incorrect”. It’s not that simple. Think of a probability statement as being a model of whatever reality you are trying to evaluate. So, under some extremely constrained assumptions, this could be the best probability model. Those assumptions would be 1) “being born” refers to Americans, or people born in the United States; 2) you don’t know anything about the states, except that there are 50 of them; 3) immigration is not a significant factor. If that’s all you know, then this may be the best model you can come up with. Now, if you go run some data, say, interview 2500 US citizens at random, and see how many were born in NJ (like I was, btw), then you might get an result like 70 (which reflects simply the current ratio of NJ to US population), while your model predicts 50. So, is this a good model or a bad model? It’s the right order of magnitude, but it’s off by about 30%. The question is whether that is a good enough estimate for what you want to know. The next obvious step in data modeling, is to add some detail to your model. Try considering the population of NJ relative to the US; consider the birth rate; consider the birth rate data over the last 75 years; or take into account how many people in NJ and in the US are immigrants to the US. If you put in an hour of research, you could come up with a much more accurate model. So as a model, assuming a probability of 1/50 is not an incorrect model, it’s just not a very good model. With a very modest effort, you could make a much better model. 293 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Springboard Learn data science in Python with a mentor.

Ask New Question   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Answered Aug 14, 2017 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views Here’s the thing that no one ever bothers to make clear. Probability IS NOT a intrinsic property of reality the way most people think it is. (Physics does treat probability as fundamental at the quantum scale, but even that is just a model —albeit a remarkably effective one). It’s almost never useful to say that a probability is correct or incorrect — only that one model seems to be more or less accurate than another. When we say that a coin has a 50% probability of landing on heads/tails when flipped, that really isn’t a statement about the coin flip, it’s a statement about our uncertainty in the process. It’s a useful mathematical model to capture what is too hard to predict. The difficulty in the prediction comes from the initial conditions of the flip and the somewhat chaotic nature of the dynamics of a spinning coin interacting with the environment. Would we have been incorrect to say 51% rather than 50%? Well, the model that says 51% might do a better job or a worse job of describing coin flips. To figure out which, we could collect data and evaluate which model is more accurate. But even if the 50% model is more accurate, that doesn’t make the 51% model incorrect — only less accurate. It would be misleading to call it incorrect because the 50% model is also “incorrect” in the sense that it certainly isn’t a perfect description of reality. The 50% model might be less incorrect than the 51% model, but it isn’t correct in any useful sense. The point is, a probability model should only be called “incorrect” if it violates the axioms of probability. For example, if I said that there is a 50% chance of heads and a 60% chance of tails, that would be an incorrect model. But if a model doesn’t violate the mathematical “rules” then the model isn’t incorrect. It may be utterly useless in making predictions about reality, but that’s a different issue altogether. So in my opinion, it isn’t incorrect to claim that the probability of being born in New Jersey is [math]\frac 1{50}[/math] (or any other number between zero and one) provided you agree that your model requires the probability of not being born in New Jersey to be [math]\frac{49}{50}[/math] . But neither is it correct to make this claim. You have just made a valid probability model, and it is up to you to determine whether or not this valid model makes predictions that are useful to you. With that said, I suspect your model is far less accurate than you want it to be. You could create a better (i.e. more predicatively accurate) model by carefully collecting and studying demographic data. But whatever model you come up with won’t be “correct” in any useful sense, so calling this lousy model “incorrect” is also not a useful description. 655 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

It’s meaningless. You would have to define “probability of being born”. That involves a precise definition of your conditions. However, even if you mean “The probability of baby being born in NJ in 2018 given that the baby is born in the USA” then 1/50 is not right. Because the number of births in a states is not 1/50 in each state. You’d need to take a guess at what proportion of babies will be born in NJ. That will be strongly related to the population of NJ (about 9 million, or about 2.7% of the US population) but you’d have to weight it by the age pyramid of the state vs. other states (because people have babies when they are between 15 and 50, roughly) and also by religious preferences and other things. Or maybe you mean “Given that a person is American, what is the probability he/she was born in NJ?” to answer that, you’d need to look at births in each state over time. You’d probably want to weight this by age too. It would be easier to restrict it to a single age. So, e.g., the proportion of 50 year old Americans born in NJ depends on how many babies were born in NJ 50 years ago, compared to the country as a whole. I don’t have data on that, but it’s going to be much higher than 2.7% because, 50 years ago, NJ had a much higher proportion of the overall population and because a lot more people move from NJ than move to NJ from other places. We do have some data [1] . In 1967, the number of Americans age 18–44 was 68.1 million. Of these, 2.4 million were born in NJ, or about 3.5%. Now, that assumes that the birth rate among 18–44 year olds is similar across states, which might not be true.

There are several things wrong with that statement. First where is the sample from ? if you pick someone anywhere in the world then the likelihood is much less than 1/50th since the US itself is only less than 1/10th the world population Second where are you picking this sample? I guarantee if you restrict it to Americans in the USA then it will still be wrong if you sample in the west coast area. That’s because people are not uniformly mixed… many tend to stay in the area where they were born and raised. If you were to make a map of where all the NewJerseyites were, there’d be a dark area around new Jersey and thinning out tremendously in the rest of the country and even thinner the world outside the US. Finally, NJ is one of the most populous states in the US, that weights its contribution even higher than 1/50. NJ has a population of just under 9 million and the US pop is around 300 million. That increases your chances to .03 by population from .02 (which is 1/50) by simple state count.

You know absolutely nothing about the birth rate or population of the states. You don’t have any opportunity to build a model by sampling real data.

I was born in the UK. With a US population of 323 million and worldwide population of 7.5 billion, there’s less than a 5% chance of even being born in the USA, let alone in a particular one of the 50 states. Just considering one country, the chance of you being born in a particular state can depend on the population of that state. Also are there many hospitals in the state or are many just over the border in an adjacent state? Is this a state where many people come to retire (and are thus less likely to have children)? Or a state where people are encouraged to have large families? There are so many factors that the chance of being born in New Jersey may be 1 in 50, but that is not implicit from there are 50 states. It’s like saying “Women range in age from 1 to 120. So the chance of me being the child of a 120 year old woman is 1 in 120.” or At present, there are 50 Broadway shows going on in the USA. So, if I am watching a Broadway show, with there being 50 states, the chance of me being in New Jersey at the time should be 1 in 50. And the chance of me watching the Broadway show in Hawaii is also 1 in 50. 6.1k Views · View Upvoters   Kelly Kinkade , US citizen for over 45 years Answered Aug 8, 2017 · Author has 7.6k answers and 36.6m answer views This is an incorrect application of what is sometimes called the “principle of indifference” or the “principle of insufficient reason”, often stated as “Absent evidence to the contrary, all outcomes of a trial should be assumed to have equal probability.” For a brief discussion, I direct you to Appendix D of Don Blaheta’s Ph.D. thesis, which you can find here: Don Blaheta's PhD thesis, ``Function tagging'' The problem with applying the Principle of Indifference here is that there is loads of “evidence to the contrary” which makes the assumption of equal probabilities inappropriate. It is plainly evident that the birth rates are not equal in every US state. And it is plainly evident that there are people not born in any state.

There are many other factors to determine the probability such as population size, fertility rates by state, number of people of child bearing age and other factors. If you have a states that skews older and with fewer people of child bearing age the birth rate will be lower than a state with more people of a child bearing age. You'd have more likelihood of being born in California or Texas, two of the more populated states so the probably there is almost certainly higher than a 1/50 probability. You'd need a demographer to crunch those numbers. 65 Views   Daniel Hou , studied at San Jose State University Answered Aug 8, 2017 · Author has 71 answers and 50k answer views Incorrect. That probability only works if the population of all the states in the Union are the same and every state has the same birth rate. By population alone, the probability of being born in New Jersey is 3 percent, which is bigger than 1/50 (1/50 is 2 percent). I am not sure what the birth rates are in New Jersey, but you would have to factor that in as well to get a ballpark estimate. 129 Views · View Upvoters   Mike Smith Answered Sep 13, 2017 · Author has 848 answers and 249.8k answer views If we assume we’re talking only about the possibility of being born in the US, and we make other typical/default assumptions about other possible factors, then the natural first answer would be P(NJ) = Population(NJ) / Population(USA) which just grabbing some numbers off Google is (8.944M / 323.1M = ) about 2.77%.

Further P ( L | F 29)= 1, since a person is born on a leap year with probability 1 if they were born on February 29th (by de nition of a leap year). If we assume that a person is equally likely to be born on any given day within a leap year, then. Using these calculations in (2) above, we have:   To be more precise you could follow this logic: there are 485 years in a 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are 485(366)+(2000 − 485)(365) = 730485 total days. Of those, days, February 29th occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is: . This second solution is a closer approximation to the true probability of being born on February 29th, since it is not subject to as much rounding error as that in (4), but  both answers are approriate. 4.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question   Anil Kulkarni , friendswan: Inspired by wisdom Answered Mar 28, 2016 · Author has 815 answers and 450.5k answer views We have Feb 29 in leap year, i.e. once in 4 years. Number of days in 4 years 365 X 4  + 1 (extra day) = 1461 days. Formula of Probability: P(A) = Actual No. of possibilities / Total No. of possibilities.

Answered May 17, 2015 Given that out of every 400 years, 97 are leap years, surely the answer is given by P(born on Feb 29) = P(born on Feb 29|born in a leap year)P(born in a leap year) + P(born on Feb 29|born in a normal year)P(born in a normal year) So P(born on Feb 29) = ​  i.e. the odds are approximately 1 in 1509. 5.1k Views   Ankit Bhanot , 22, Engineer, Life Explorer Answered May 14, 2015 · Author has 200 answers and 751.3k answer views Well the probability of being born on February 29 totally depends upon your parents. :p  But if we talk of mathematics 4 years equals 1460 days. Adding 1 of leap year makes it 1461. So the probability of being born on February 29 is 1/1461.  But this is not the exact value and changes with time. Because we always take some assumptions while calculating time. So accordingly it is required to lose 3 leap days every 400 years. The reason being that Earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit around sun. We make that 365 days for 3 years and add that extra day due to approximation of 0.2422 in the fourth year but still its not accurate. 0.2422*4 = 0.9688 but we take it as one day. So to make up for it. we need to lose 3 leaps days every 400 years ( still approximation )  So for the record your answer is 1/1461 but if we take it to the next level of accuracy it changes but you may go with 1/1461. :) 3.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Abhay Mittal promoted  by Boomerang for Gmail Ever wonder how your emails are coming across?

What are the odds?  What are the odds that you exist, as you, today? Author Ali Binazir attemps to quantify the probability that you came about and exist as you today, and reveals that the odds of you existing are almost zero.  LET'S START SMALL What is the probability of your dad meeting your mom? Though the world was smaller 20 years ago, your dad could have met almost 200 million of its women (go dad!) But over 25 years, he probably met around 10,000 women. So the odds that your mom was in this small group and met your dad is: 1 in 20,000  BUT WE KNOW HOW TRICKY LOVE CAN BE. What is the probability that they stay together long enough to have kids? It is a 1 in 10 chance that they talk to each other. Also a 1 in 10 chance that they go on a second date. Another 1 in 10 chance that they keep dating for a while. And a coin toss if they stay together long enough for offspring. Thus, the odds that your parents' meeting results in kids is: 1 in 2,000  So far, the combines odds of you being here are: 1 in 40,000,000 That is about the size of the population of California.  NOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET PRETTY INTERESTING Why? Because we are about to deal with eggs and sperm, which come in large numbers. Mom has about 100,000 eggs in her lifetime. Dad makes about 4 trillion sperm during the years you could have been born.  What are the odds that the 1 egg... (Sally)... ...met the 1 sperm, which together made you(and not your brother)? (Harry) 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 400 quadrillion)That is approximately the volume in cubic meters of the Atlantic Ocean (3,236x10 17 cubic meters).  BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED Because your existence here, now, and on planet earth presupposes another supremely unlikely and utterly undeniable chain of events. Namely, that every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age- going all the way back not just to the first Homo sapiens, first Homo erectus and Homo habilis, but all the way back to the first single-celled organism. You are a representative of an unbroken lineage of life going back 4 billion years.  What are the odds that you lineage remained unbroken for the length of human existence? (You.Aw.) 1 in 2 odds that a child will be born, grow, and reproduce per generation... ... for 150,000 generations  1 in 10  45,000 That's a 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it.  How large is that number? That number is not just larger than all the particles in the universe-it is larger that all the particles in the universe if each particle were itself a universe.  THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. The right sperm also had to meet the right egg for every single one of those ancestors.  (Weeeee!) ODDS OF THE RIGHT SPERM, MEETING THE RIGHT EGG 150,000 TIMES? 1 in 10 2,640,000 That is 1 quadrillion multiplied by 1 quadrillion for every generation.  Let's add it all up  10 2,640,000 x 10 45,000 x 2000 x 20,000= 1 in 10 2,685,000  BY COMPARISON: The number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg. 175 lb) is about: 10 27 The number of atoms making up the earth is about: 10 50 The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at: 10 80  THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: It is the probability of 2 million people getting together (about the population of San Diego) each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up with the exact same number-for example, 550,343,279,001.  SO, THE ODDS THAT YOU EXIST AT ALL ARE: BASICALLY ZERO.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, we have just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and ac like the miracle that you are.

One in 10? One in 50? One in 100? If you're over 62, your odds of having at least $1 million in net wealth (your total assets minus your total debt) are relatively achievable — about 1 in 7. But if you are under 40, your odds are low: 1 in 55. In the last 25 years, the odds that an old person is a millionaire have improved slightly. But for young people, they have gotten much worse. These figures come from a new paper by economists at the St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability, which shows evidence of a growing wealth gap that few people are talking about — the gap between the young and the old. The paper, by William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, draws on surveys of 40,000 families that the Fed carried out between 1989 and 2013 to examine the all-important role that your age plays in how much income you make and how much wealth you accumulate. It offers a few clues as to how young people can game the system and end up like their wealthy older counterparts, as well as a lot of evidence to show that things are just different for young people today. One of the most important points that the paper makes is that everyone's income and wealth tend to follow a kind of natural pattern during their life. Young people (generally defined here as those under 40) haven't been working for many years, so they don't have an opportunity to save as much; they also need to make investments in things like education and new home ownership. Middle-aged people (40-61) have been working long enough that they start to accumulate wealth rapidly. And old people (62 and up) begin to draw down on their wealth, to finance their retirement. You can see these trends in this incredible graph below, from their paper. People born in different years (1901, 1904, 1907 and so on) were surveyed at various times between 1989 and 2013 about their median family income. The chart below shows their age on the horizontal axis, and the median family income they reported making at the time on the vertical axis. The slope of each of the different colored lines shows how income was changing for that group between 1989 and 2013. For example, for the youngest generations, who appear on the left-hand side of the graph, the lines sharply slope upward because their net income is rising. World Economic Forum Here's the same graph for wealth (assets minus debt), rather than income. If you compare this with the previous chart, you can see that net worth takes a longer time to amass than income, and then declines less slowly. That's partly because a lot of people take on debt at the beginning of their lives — student debt, mortgages, etc — and thus have negative net worth. It's also because people lose their incomes as they retire, but tend to hold on to their largest sources of net worth, like their homes. World Economic Forum From bad to worse Basically, young people have always been poor. But looking beyond that basic trend, you can see that today's young people are poorer than young people of the past. The period of time in which someone is born can also have a dramatic effect on their wealth compared with other generations. The winners of this historical jackpot appear to be those who were born between 1930 and 1945 and came of age after World War II, who are sometimes called The Silent Generation. Both the Silent Generation and the generation that came before them, called The Greatest Generation because they fought in World War II, benefited from America's rapid economic growth after World War II. (As Thomas Piketty describes in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, this was not necessarily a happy story: The U.S. grew so fast after World War II because it was the only place in the world with manufacturing capacity - Europe had literally been leveled.) But The Silent Generation appears to get an additional boost because they were born during the Great Depression, a time when people had fewer babies overall. Their lower population meant that they had less competition overall for jobs, housing, investments and other opportunities. Sociologist Elwood Carlson called the generation "the lucky few" because they were smaller than the generation that came before. African-Americans and women born in those years had far more opportunity, and the generation also benefited from the expansion of the American safety net, including Social Security and Medicare, during their lives. YouTube/The Pilion Trust Charity "People born in the first half of the 20th century simply may have been in the right place at the right time as they were lifted by a rising tide," the economists write. Then came the Baby Boomers, the populous generation born after World War II. They haven't fared as well as their predecessors, in part because their greater numbers have meant more competition, and perhaps in part because the world is just a different place. The Boomers were the first generation to really experience the effects of globalization and competition from workers in the developing world. That, as well as automation and the decline of labor unions have all eroded wage growth on the lower end of the income spectrum. The charts below illustrate this difference. A sliver of the Greatest Generation, born in 1915-1917, is represented on the far right side of both graphs in teal. Part of the Silent Generation (born 1933-1935) appears in cornflower blue, while some Boomers (born 1954-1956) appear in beige. The horizontal axis shows the person's age, and the vertical axis shows their income (on the left) or median net worth (on the right). If you look at Figure 3 on the right, you can see how much better the Silent Generation did than the generations that came before or after them. Notice where the blue line overlaps with the teal line — that shows that those born between 1933 and 1935 had a much higher net worth in their 70's than those born between 1915 and 1917. In the same graph, the overlap between the blue line and the beige line shows that the Silent Generation also had a higher net worth than the Boomers did when both generations were in their mid to late 50's. World Economic Forum William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability In just 25 years, the wealth gap between young and old people has yawned wider. In 1989, old families had 7.6 times as much median wealth as young families. By 2013, it had grown to 14.7 times. According to the economists' calculations, someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than an identical person born in 1940. It's not clear exactly why this is, the economists say. The financial crisis and Great Recession certainly set young people back, but young people were doing comparatively worse even before that. And the trends are true even though America's younger generations are its most educated ever. Part of the reason could be that younger Americans are far more diverse than older generations, and race- and ethnicity-based disadvantages continue to loom large in the U.S., the economists say. White and Asian families are far wealthier than black and Hispanic families in the U.S., across all age groups. Flickr The difference may also be due to the difference in financial decisions between young and old people. Old people generally have more diverse investments, carry less debt and are more cushioned against financial shocks than younger people. If young people want to increase their chances of being wealthy, one strategy is to emulate the behavior of older people: keeping an emergency fund, paying down debt, avoiding high-cost credit, and putting money into higher-returning investments, the economists say. One strategy that might work for young people is delaying the purchase of a house. By doing so, young people can save and make a bigger down payment later, and thus lower their debt burden, as well as make more diverse investments in the interim. But even if Millennials and Gen Xers follow these strategies, the historical trends don't appear to be on their side. "Some people are just born lucky," the economists conclude.

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 — yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes! Binazir concludes that the odds of you being alive are basically zero . visual.ly SEE ALSO: See How The Most Popular Baby Names Have Changed Over Time >    More:  Baby  Science  Parents and Kids      facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link           Recommended For You   Powered By Sailthru              Powered By Sailthru                       Follow us on:                  Also check out:           * Copyright © 2018 Business Insider Inc.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don’t matter. The fact you’re alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you…   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let’s remember there are people out there that can’t eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don’t feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that “it” may be. Unfortunately, people aren’t grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don’t have. When you see regret in a person’s eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn’t. No matter the shit hand you’re dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don’t care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you’re actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

It's mind blowing to think about all of the things that had to be in place for you to be born. Just from the beginning of the Earth an immeasurable amount of events have taken place to bring you into existence. For example, the chances of your mother meeting your father and staying together long enough to have a child is slim. Multiply that by every person in your family tree all the way back to the first living organism. In addition to the obvious variables of the parents, you also have the chances of the Earth being in the right location in the universe and having the right environment that would last long enough to give you life. People have figured out vague numbers of the odds of your existence but in reality, there are too many variables to really nail down any exact odds because in calculating the odds there always has to be a starting point and the odds of that starting point being there are also immeasurable. Whatever the odds of you being born...you...remember that your existence is an amazing accomplishment against uncountable odds. Do something cool with it.

To know this you would need to know how many living creatures are born on the whole planet on a determined lapse of time. We would need an experienced team of biologists to come up with an educated estimation. You have to weigh in all humans, all animal, al insects, all plants, all bateria. That is the hard part. The easy part is just adding up the results and calculate the probabilities. Since the numbers here would be massive, you would probbably have to work in units per second. I don’t know the results but I’d assume the it would be quite a bit like this: 85% chance of being born a bacteria. 7% chance of being born as a plant. 6% chance of being born as an insect. 1.99999% chance of being born as any animal. 0.00001% chance of being born a human. This is every second. Now have in mind that this came out my mind. For accurate result an exhaustive survey should be done and that would be excruciating work. 1.8k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below What is the probability of being born?

Ask New Question   Joe Doe Updated Jan 10, 2018 Nobody knows the precise probability, but it’s definitely almost Infinitely miniature. We would not be around if just one of the following processes hadn’t occurred (each event exponentially less likely to have occured than the event prior to it): Your dad and mom decided to mate at the exact period of time they did. A male is constantly replacing millions of his sperm a day, so if your parents decided to mate a few months post/prior than they did, most likely, a different sperm would’ve met your mother’s egg, and you wouldn’t be born. Even using the fact that they DID mate at the time they did, there were millions of sperm released when they mated, and it had to be the EXACT right one out of millions sperm, with the EXACT right one of ~300,000 eggs from your mom. (Chance of birth is already extraordinary small, and we’re just getting started). The above process applied to your four grandparents…and your eight great-grandparents…and your sixteen great-great-grandparents…and all the way down your ~3.9 billion years of ancestral line. If just ONE of those ancestors died/didn’t have kids for whatever reason, you wouldn’t be born, meaning those exact environmental pressures/ecological events had to occur throughout the history of life on Earth. The right chemicals were at the right place, in the right time, to create some form of biological reaction - the origin of life on Earth (notice I didn’t say on which planet/object this process took place). Large amounts of rock came together to form a more massive ball, which happened to be in the habitable zone of our sun; the ball now known as the Earth. In some nebula far far away, a random mass of some hydrogen and helium had come together, to form the star we now know as our sun ~5 billion years ago. The creation of the sun’s birth nebula. (It’s still unknown to scientists exactly which nebula gave birth to our sun). The big bang. If the universe had never been created, then (quite obviously) the world as we know it wouldn’t have existed. Who knows the probability of the big bang’s occurrence; to this day, nobody knows how the big bang was formed… So that gives you a perspective of how unlikely you are to be born-as a human. You could always look at it another way, however. You’d only know if you existed, and wouldn’t know if you weren’t alive. Therefore, in your realm of consciousness, you’d have a 100% chance of being born. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Undo Answer Wiki 20 Answers   Mark Garrett , PhD in Electrical Engineering, Columbia University Answered Aug 16, 2017 · Author has 415 answers and 149.8k answer views What is incorrect about this statement is the notion that a probability is either “correct” or “incorrect”. It’s not that simple. Think of a probability statement as being a model of whatever reality you are trying to evaluate. So, under some extremely constrained assumptions, this could be the best probability model. Those assumptions would be 1) “being born” refers to Americans, or people born in the United States; 2) you don’t know anything about the states, except that there are 50 of them; 3) immigration is not a significant factor. If that’s all you know, then this may be the best model you can come up with. Now, if you go run some data, say, interview 2500 US citizens at random, and see how many were born in NJ (like I was, btw), then you might get an result like 70 (which reflects simply the current ratio of NJ to US population), while your model predicts 50. So, is this a good model or a bad model? It’s the right order of magnitude, but it’s off by about 30%. The question is whether that is a good enough estimate for what you want to know. The next obvious step in data modeling, is to add some detail to your model. Try considering the population of NJ relative to the US; consider the birth rate; consider the birth rate data over the last 75 years; or take into account how many people in NJ and in the US are immigrants to the US. If you put in an hour of research, you could come up with a much more accurate model. So as a model, assuming a probability of 1/50 is not an incorrect model, it’s just not a very good model. With a very modest effort, you could make a much better model. 293 Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Answered Aug 14, 2017 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views Here’s the thing that no one ever bothers to make clear. Probability IS NOT a intrinsic property of reality the way most people think it is. (Physics does treat probability as fundamental at the quantum scale, but even that is just a model —albeit a remarkably effective one). It’s almost never useful to say that a probability is correct or incorrect — only that one model seems to be more or less accurate than another. When we say that a coin has a 50% probability of landing on heads/tails when flipped, that really isn’t a statement about the coin flip, it’s a statement about our uncertainty in the process. It’s a useful mathematical model to capture what is too hard to predict. The difficulty in the prediction comes from the initial conditions of the flip and the somewhat chaotic nature of the dynamics of a spinning coin interacting with the environment. Would we have been incorrect to say 51% rather than 50%? Well, the model that says 51% might do a better job or a worse job of describing coin flips. To figure out which, we could collect data and evaluate which model is more accurate. But even if the 50% model is more accurate, that doesn’t make the 51% model incorrect — only less accurate. It would be misleading to call it incorrect because the 50% model is also “incorrect” in the sense that it certainly isn’t a perfect description of reality. The 50% model might be less incorrect than the 51% model, but it isn’t correct in any useful sense. The point is, a probability model should only be called “incorrect” if it violates the axioms of probability. For example, if I said that there is a 50% chance of heads and a 60% chance of tails, that would be an incorrect model. But if a model doesn’t violate the mathematical “rules” then the model isn’t incorrect. It may be utterly useless in making predictions about reality, but that’s a different issue altogether. So in my opinion, it isn’t incorrect to claim that the probability of being born in New Jersey is [math]\frac 1{50}[/math] (or any other number between zero and one) provided you agree that your model requires the probability of not being born in New Jersey to be [math]\frac{49}{50}[/math] . But neither is it correct to make this claim. You have just made a valid probability model, and it is up to you to determine whether or not this valid model makes predictions that are useful to you. With that said, I suspect your model is far less accurate than you want it to be. You could create a better (i.e. more predicatively accurate) model by carefully collecting and studying demographic data. But whatever model you come up with won’t be “correct” in any useful sense, so calling this lousy model “incorrect” is also not a useful description. 655 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by DatadogHQ.com Datadog: cloud monitoring as a service.

It’s meaningless. You would have to define “probability of being born”. That involves a precise definition of your conditions. However, even if you mean “The probability of baby being born in NJ in 2018 given that the baby is born in the USA” then 1/50 is not right. Because the number of births in a states is not 1/50 in each state. You’d need to take a guess at what proportion of babies will be born in NJ. That will be strongly related to the population of NJ (about 9 million, or about 2.7% of the US population) but you’d have to weight it by the age pyramid of the state vs. other states (because people have babies when they are between 15 and 50, roughly) and also by religious preferences and other things. Or maybe you mean “Given that a person is American, what is the probability he/she was born in NJ?” to answer that, you’d need to look at births in each state over time. You’d probably want to weight this by age too. It would be easier to restrict it to a single age. So, e.g., the proportion of 50 year old Americans born in NJ depends on how many babies were born in NJ 50 years ago, compared to the country as a whole. I don’t have data on that, but it’s going to be much higher than 2.7% because, 50 years ago, NJ had a much higher proportion of the overall population and because a lot more people move from NJ than move to NJ from other places. We do have some data [1] . In 1967, the number of Americans age 18–44 was 68.1 million. Of these, 2.4 million were born in NJ, or about 3.5%. Now, that assumes that the birth rate among 18–44 year olds is similar across states, which might not be true.

There are several things wrong with that statement. First where is the sample from ? if you pick someone anywhere in the world then the likelihood is much less than 1/50th since the US itself is only less than 1/10th the world population Second where are you picking this sample? I guarantee if you restrict it to Americans in the USA then it will still be wrong if you sample in the west coast area. That’s because people are not uniformly mixed… many tend to stay in the area where they were born and raised. If you were to make a map of where all the NewJerseyites were, there’d be a dark area around new Jersey and thinning out tremendously in the rest of the country and even thinner the world outside the US. Finally, NJ is one of the most populous states in the US, that weights its contribution even higher than 1/50. NJ has a population of just under 9 million and the US pop is around 300 million. That increases your chances to .03 by population from .02 (which is 1/50) by simple state count. If you choose a person at random distributition anywhere in the US. 354 Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?

You know absolutely nothing about the birth rate or population of the states. You don’t have any opportunity to build a model by sampling real data.

I was born in the UK. With a US population of 323 million and worldwide population of 7.5 billion, there’s less than a 5% chance of even being born in the USA, let alone in a particular one of the 50 states. Just considering one country, the chance of you being born in a particular state can depend on the population of that state. Also are there many hospitals in the state or are many just over the border in an adjacent state? Is this a state where many people come to retire (and are thus less likely to have children)? Or a state where people are encouraged to have large families? There are so many factors that the chance of being born in New Jersey may be 1 in 50, but that is not implicit from there are 50 states. It’s like saying “Women range in age from 1 to 120. So the chance of me being the child of a 120 year old woman is 1 in 120.” or At present, there are 50 Broadway shows going on in the USA. So, if I am watching a Broadway show, with there being 50 states, the chance of me being in New Jersey at the time should be 1 in 50. And the chance of me watching the Broadway show in Hawaii is also 1 in 50. 6.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?

It is plainly evident that the birth rates are not equal in every US state. And it is plainly evident that there are people not born in any state. Just these two facts alone are enough to upset the already shaky Principle of Indifference and force you to base your probabilities on data that is, in fact, fairly readily available. 8.9k Views · View Upvoters   Arun Kannawadi , works at Carnegie Mellon University Answered Aug 10, 2017 Of course, it is incorrect.

There are many other factors to determine the probability such as population size, fertility rates by state, number of people of child bearing age and other factors. If you have a states that skews older and with fewer people of child bearing age the birth rate will be lower than a state with more people of a child bearing age. You'd have more likelihood of being born in California or Texas, two of the more populated states so the probably there is almost certainly higher than a 1/50 probability. You'd need a demographer to crunch those numbers. 65 Views   Daniel Hou , studied at San Jose State University Answered Aug 8, 2017 · Author has 71 answers and 50k answer views Incorrect. That probability only works if the population of all the states in the Union are the same and every state has the same birth rate. By population alone, the probability of being born in New Jersey is 3 percent, which is bigger than 1/50 (1/50 is 2 percent). I am not sure what the birth rates are in New Jersey, but you would have to factor that in as well to get a ballpark estimate. 129 Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

The birth rate in NJ might be higher or lower than in other places in the US, for example, which would affect the results. 17 Views   Richard Thiebaud , works at Retired Answered Aug 8, 2017 Like many probability questions, this depends on how you select the person. If you are picking uniformly out of all the people born in a given time period, incorrect. If you are randomly picking a state, then picking someone from that state born in a given time period, correct. You can’t meaningfully talk about probability of an event unless you specify how you choose out of the universe of possibilities. 112 Views Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?   Ashwin Dollar , lives in The United States of America Answered Aug 11, 2017 · Author has 4.6k answers and 1.3m answer views That probability makes no sense. The way you calculate this probability is to calculate how many women are pregnant in each state (you can’t compare populations as total fertility rates vary by state) and then adjust for how many of those pregnancies successfully make it to term. Another valid option is to compare how many people were born in each state in a given year. 56 Views   Kenneth Lundgren , former Staff Engineer at Motorola (1965-1981) Answered Aug 9, 2017 · Author has 2.1k answers and 301.7k answer views The most basic consideration is to compare the population of New Jersey compared to other states.

Answered Mar 6, 2016 · Author has 65 answers and 177.6k answer views Let F 29 be the event that a person is born on February 29th, and let L be the event that that a person is born on a Leap year. As a practical approximation, there are 485 leap years in 2 millennia = 2000 years, so, the probability of being born in a leap year, given a frequentist interpretation of probability, is(This is a bit of a simplication, since the probability is a little bit larger than this as we’ve assumed equal chance of years here see solution 2 which does not make this assumption). We can use Baye’s theorm to determine the solution. According to Baye’s theorem: (1) Rearranging terms in (1), we can easily solve for P ( F 29) using: (2)  We know, assuming a person is equally likely to be born in any given year. Further P ( L | F 29)= 1, since a person is born on a leap year with probability 1 if they were born on February 29th (by de nition of a leap year). If we assume that a person is equally likely to be born on any given day within a leap year, then. Using these calculations in (2) above, we have:   To be more precise you could follow this logic: there are 485 years in a 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are 485(366)+(2000 − 485)(365) = 730485 total days. Of those, days, February 29th occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is: . This second solution is a closer approximation to the true probability of being born on February 29th, since it is not subject to as much rounding error as that in (4), but  both answers are approriate. 4.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Adding 1 of leap year makes it 1461. So the probability of being born on February 29 is 1/1461.  But this is not the exact value and changes with time. Because we always take some assumptions while calculating time. So accordingly it is required to lose 3 leap days every 400 years. The reason being that Earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit around sun. We make that 365 days for 3 years and add that extra day due to approximation of 0.2422 in the fourth year but still its not accurate. 0.2422*4 = 0.9688 but we take it as one day. So to make up for it. we need to lose 3 leaps days every 400 years ( still approximation )  So for the record your answer is 1/1461 but if we take it to the next level of accuracy it changes but you may go with 1/1461. :) 3.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Abhay Mittal promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

What are the odds?  What are the odds that you exist, as you, today? Author Ali Binazir attemps to quantify the probability that you came about and exist as you today, and reveals that the odds of you existing are almost zero.  LET'S START SMALL What is the probability of your dad meeting your mom? Though the world was smaller 20 years ago, your dad could have met almost 200 million of its women (go dad!) But over 25 years, he probably met around 10,000 women. So the odds that your mom was in this small group and met your dad is: 1 in 20,000  BUT WE KNOW HOW TRICKY LOVE CAN BE. What is the probability that they stay together long enough to have kids? It is a 1 in 10 chance that they talk to each other. Also a 1 in 10 chance that they go on a second date. Another 1 in 10 chance that they keep dating for a while. And a coin toss if they stay together long enough for offspring. Thus, the odds that your parents' meeting results in kids is: 1 in 2,000  So far, the combines odds of you being here are: 1 in 40,000,000 That is about the size of the population of California.  NOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET PRETTY INTERESTING Why? Because we are about to deal with eggs and sperm, which come in large numbers. Mom has about 100,000 eggs in her lifetime. Dad makes about 4 trillion sperm during the years you could have been born.  What are the odds that the 1 egg... (Sally)... ...met the 1 sperm, which together made you(and not your brother)? (Harry) 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 400 quadrillion)That is approximately the volume in cubic meters of the Atlantic Ocean (3,236x10 17 cubic meters).  BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED Because your existence here, now, and on planet earth presupposes another supremely unlikely and utterly undeniable chain of events. Namely, that every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age- going all the way back not just to the first Homo sapiens, first Homo erectus and Homo habilis, but all the way back to the first single-celled organism. You are a representative of an unbroken lineage of life going back 4 billion years.  What are the odds that you lineage remained unbroken for the length of human existence? (You.Aw.) 1 in 2 odds that a child will be born, grow, and reproduce per generation... ... for 150,000 generations  1 in 10  45,000 That's a 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it.  How large is that number? That number is not just larger than all the particles in the universe-it is larger that all the particles in the universe if each particle were itself a universe.  THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. The right sperm also had to meet the right egg for every single one of those ancestors.  (Weeeee!) ODDS OF THE RIGHT SPERM, MEETING THE RIGHT EGG 150,000 TIMES? 1 in 10 2,640,000 That is 1 quadrillion multiplied by 1 quadrillion for every generation.  Let's add it all up  10 2,640,000 x 10 45,000 x 2000 x 20,000= 1 in 10 2,685,000  BY COMPARISON: The number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg. 175 lb) is about: 10 27 The number of atoms making up the earth is about: 10 50 The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at: 10 80  THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: It is the probability of 2 million people getting together (about the population of San Diego) each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up with the exact same number-for example, 550,343,279,001.  SO, THE ODDS THAT YOU EXIST AT ALL ARE: BASICALLY ZERO.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, we have just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and ac like the miracle that you are.
