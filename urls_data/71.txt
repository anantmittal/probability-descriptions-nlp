Category Cancer A-Z          Cancer Basics             Lifetime Risk of Developing or Dying From Cancer      The lifetime risk of developing or dying from cancer refers to the chance a person has, over the course of his or her lifetime (from birth to death), of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer. These risk estimates, like annual incidence and mortality data, provide another measure of how widespread cancer is in the United States.  The following tables list lifetime risks of developing and dying from certain cancers for men and women. The information is from the US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database, and is based on incidence and mortality data for the United States from 2012 through 2014, the most current years for which data are available.  The risk is expressed both in terms of a percentage and as odds.   For example, the risk that a man will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime is 3.76%. This means he has about 1 chance in 27 of developing bladder cancer (100/3.76 = 26.6).  Put another way, 1 out of every 27 men in the United States will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime.   These numbers are average risks for the overall US population. Your risk may be higher or lower than these numbers, depending on your particular risk factors.

The number of deaths was 166.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 38.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer of any site at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 14,738,719 people living with cancer of any site in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Cancer of Any Site?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  67.0%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from cancer of any site. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

Cancer Statistics   Cancer Disparities                      Cancer Statistics              Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world. Cancer statistics describe what happens in large groups of people and provide a picture in time of the burden of cancer on society. Statistics tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year, the number of people who are currently living after a cancer diagnosis, the average age at diagnosis, and the numbers of people who are still alive at a given time after diagnosis. They also tell us about differences among groups defined by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, geographic location, and other categories.  If you are looking for information about chances of surviving cancer and prognosis, see the Understanding Cancer Prognosis page.      View this video on YouTube.     Information on cancer statistics, how cancer statistics are calculated, and where the data come from.   Although statistical trends are usually not directly applicable to individual patients, they are essential for governments, policy makers, health professionals, and researchers to understand the impact of cancer on the population and to develop strategies to address the challenges that cancer poses to the society at large. Statistical trends are also important for measuring the success of efforts to control and manage cancer.  Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer in the United States   In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people will die from the disease.  The most common cancers in 2016 are projected to be breast cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, prostate cancer, colon and rectum cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma of the skin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid cancer, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, leukemia, endometrial cancer, and pancreatic cancer.  The number of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence ) is 454.8 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 cases).  The number of cancer deaths (cancer mortality ) is 171.2 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 deaths).  Cancer mortality is higher among men than women (207.9 per 100,000 men and 145.4 per 100,000 women). It is highest in African American men (261.5 per 100,000) and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islander women (91.2 per 100,000). (Based on 2008-2012 deaths.)  The number of people living beyond a cancer diagnosis reached nearly 14.5 million in 2014 and is expected to rise to almost 19 million by 2024.  Approximately 39.6% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2010-2012 data).  In 2014, an estimated 15,780 children and adolescents ages 0 to 19 were diagnosed with cancer and 1,960 died of the disease.  National expenditures for cancer care in the United States totaled nearly $125 billion in 2010 and could reach $156 billion in 2020.    Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer Worldwide        Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2012, there were 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths worldwide.  The number of new cancer cases will rise to 22 million within the next two decades.  More than 60% of the world’s new cancer cases occur in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America; 70% of the world’s cancer deaths also occur in these regions.   The World Health Organization’s website has more information about cancer statistics across the world.   U.S. Cancer Mortality Trends  The best indicator of progress against cancer is a change in age-adjusted mortality (death) rates, although other measures, such as quality of life, are also important. Incidence is also important, but it is not always straightforward to interpret changes in incidence. For example, if a new screening test detects many cancer cases that would never have caused a problem during someone’s life (called overdiagnosis), the incidence of that cancer would appear to increase even though the death rates do not change. But a rise in incidence can also reflect a real increase in disease, as is the case when an increase in exposure to a risk factor causes more cases of cancer. In this scenario the increased incidence would likely lead to a rise in mortality from the cancer.        In the United States, the overall cancer death rate has declined since the early 1990s. The most recent SEER Cancer Statistics Review , updated in September 2016, shows that cancer death rates decreased by:   1.8% per year among men from 2004 to 2013  1.4% per year among women from 2004 to 2013  1.4% per year among children ages 0–19 from 2009 to 2013   Although death rates for many individual cancer types have also declined, rates for a few cancers have stabilized or even increased.  As the overall cancer death rate has declined, the number of cancer survivors has increased. These trends show that progress is being made against the disease, but much work remains. Although rates of smoking, a major cause of cancer, have declined, the U.S. population is aging, and cancer rates increase with age. Obesity, another risk factor for cancer, is also increasing.  The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program  NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from population-based cancer registries that cover approximately 28% of the U.S. population. The SEER program website has more detailed cancer statistics, including population statistics for common types of cancer, customizable graphs and tables, and interactive tools.  The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer provides an annual update of cancer incidence, mortality, and trends in the United States. This report is jointly authored by experts from NCI, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    When first diagnosed with cancer, many people ask about their prognosis. You might want to know whether your cancer is relatively easy or more difficult to cure. Your doctor can't predict the future, but can make an estimate based on other people's experiences with the same cancer.   What is a cancer survival rate?    Cancer survival rates or survival statistics tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type of cancer for a specific amount of time. Cancer statistics often use an overall five-year survival rate.  Survival rates are usually given in percentages. For instance, the overall five-year survival rate for bladder cancer is 78 percent. That means that of all people who have bladder cancer, 78 of every 100 are living five years after diagnosis. Conversely, 22 out of every 100 are dead within five years of a bladder cancer diagnosis.  Cancer survival rates are based on research from information gathered on hundreds or thousands of people with a specific cancer. An overall survival rate includes people of all ages and health conditions who have been diagnosed with your cancer, including those diagnosed very early and those diagnosed very late.  Your doctor may be able to give you more specific statistics based on your stage of cancer. For instance, 56 percent, or a little more than half, of people diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer live for at least five years after diagnosis. The five-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 5 percent.  Overall survival rates don't specify whether cancer survivors are still undergoing treatment at five years or if they've become cancer-free (achieved remission). Other types of survival rates that give more specific information include:   Disease-free survival rate. This is the number of people who have no evidence of cancer after treatment.  Progression-free survival rate. This is the number of people who have been treated for cancer and either have no signs of cancer recurrence or who have cancer that has remained stable without growing.   Cancer survival rates often use a five-year survival rate. That doesn't mean cancer can't recur beyond five years. Certain cancers can recur many years after first being found and treated. For some cancers, if it has not recurred by five years after initial diagnosis, the chance of a later recurrence is very small. Discuss your risk of a cancer recurrence with your doctor.   How are cancer survival rates used?    You and your doctor might use survival statistics to:   Understand your prognosis. The experience of other people in your same situation can give you and your doctor an idea of your prognosis — the chance your cancer will be cured. Other factors include age and general health. Your doctor uses these factors to help you understand the seriousness of your condition.   Develop a treatment plan. Statistics can also show how people with your same cancer type and stage respond to treatment. You can use this information, along with your goals for treatment, to weigh the pros and cons of each treatment option.  For instance, if two treatments give you similar chances for remission, but one has more side effects, you might choose the option with fewer side effects.  In another example, a treatment may offer a chance for a cure, but only for 1 or 2 people out of every 100. For some, these chances are promising enough to put up with side effects. For others, the chance for a cure isn't worth the treatment's side effects.  Your doctor can help you understand the benefits and risks of each treatment.

Unfortunately, these messages are often missing basic facts needed for people to understand their chance of cancer: the magnitude of the chance and how it compares with the chance of other diseases.  Risk charts present these basic facts by showing the chance of dying from a variety of cancer and other diseases over specific time frames. Because age, sex and race are so important in determining your chances, the charts let you account for these factors. While other factors make an important difference (like smoking or having a serious disease run in your family), the numbers from the charts will get you into the right ballpark.  Get Started  Choose from one of the four risk charts offered below.         Big Picture Charts  Ready made charts with the 10-year chance of dying from major causes.

Smoking substantially increases the chance of dying from heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and all-causes combined. If you smoke, your chances of dying from these causes are higher than those shown in the charts - and if you never smoked, your chances of dying are lower.

Sign up now        Cancer risk: What the numbers mean Take the time to understand what cancer risk is and how it's measured. This can help you put your own cancer risk into perspective. By Mayo Clinic Staff    You might wonder about your chances of developing cancer. News reports can make it sound as if every day something is found to dramatically raise your risk. Sorting through all the information and figuring out what's valid can be tricky.   What is risk?    When scientists talk about risk, they're referring to a probability — the chance that something may occur, but not a guarantee that it will. For example, if you flip a coin, there is one chance in two, or a 50 percent chance, that the coin will land heads up.  Risk estimates for cancer and other diseases are determined by studying large groups of people. Researchers focus on the probability that any person or category of people will develop the disease over a certain period of time. They also look to see what characteristics or behaviors are associated with increased or decreased risk.   How is risk expressed?      Absolute risk        Relative risk    Risk is generally divided into two categories: absolute risk and relative risk.  Absolute risk  Absolute risk refers to the actual numeric chance or probability of developing cancer during a specified time period — for example, within the year, within the next five years, by age 50, by age 70, or during the course of a lifetime.  One type of absolute risk is lifetime risk, which is the probability that an individual will develop cancer during the course of a lifetime. For instance, an American man's absolute risk of developing prostate cancer in his lifetime is about 12 percent. Put another way, about 12 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some time in their lives. This also means that 88 out of every 100 men won't develop prostate cancer.  Lifetime risk isn't the risk that a person will develop cancer in the next year or the next five years. An individual's cancer risk has a lot to do with other factors, such as age. For instance, a woman's lifetime risk of developing colon and rectal cancer is just over 4 percent, or about 42 out of every 1,000 women. But her risk of developing colon and rectal cancer before the age of 50 is 0.3 percent, or about 3 out of every 1,000 women.  Relative risk  Relative risk gives you a comparison or ratio rather than an absolute value. It shows the strength of the relationship between a risk factor and a particular type of cancer by comparing the number of cancers in a group of people who have a particular trait with the number of cancers in a group of people who don't have that trait.  For instance, compare the relative lung cancer risk for people who smoke with the relative lung cancer risk in a similar group of people who don't smoke. You might hear relative risk being expressed like this: The risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25 times higher than the risk for people who don't smoke. So the relative risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25.  Relative risk is also given as a percentage. For example, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is 2,500 percent higher than it is for people who don't smoke.  When you hear about relative risk, there's no upper limit to the percentage increase in risk. Most people think 100 percent is the highest possible risk, but that isn't true in this case.  A relative risk of 100 percent means your risk is twice as high as that of someone without that risk factor. A 200 percent relative risk means that you are three times as likely to develop that condition.  Risk seems greater when put in these terms. A 100 percent increase in risk may seem enormous, but if the risk began as 1 in 100 people, a 100 percent increase in risk means that 2 out of 100 will be affected.

What Are Your Chances of Getting Cancer?                What Are Your Chances of Getting Cancer?  2015 - 07 - 21     A few days ago a supporter wrote, “My teammate shared this image on Facebook and got slammed
    by someone calling it ‘misinformed,’’misleading’ and ‘junk science.’ I have no idea where I could find the truth, and I thought perhaps you could point
    me in the right direction.” As my late friend Dr. David Kritchevsky, former Associate Director of Wistar Institute, quipped, “If you torture the statistics
    long enough they’ll confess.”  So should we trust those statistics?  I have not found a source for lifetime cancer risk in 1900, but the later data seem to have originated from the website of Cancer Research of the United
    Kingdom (cancerresearchuk.org), which states: “In 1975 the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer in the UK was one in four people; by the 1990s it had risen to one in three, and by 2010 it was four in 10.” That means that the risk of getting cancer
    is now close to one in two.  Similar data come from the SEER Cancer Statistics Review released April 23, 2015.  The Review, a report of the most recent cancer incidence, mortality,
    survival, prevalence, and lifetime risk statistics, is published annually by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The latest edition includes statistics
    from 1975 through 2012, the most recent year for which data are available. For all sites, the lifetime risk was again declared to be four in 10.  That figure is corroborated by the American Cancer Society website, which states that the risk of developing cancer for all invasive cancer sites is one
    in two for males and one in three for females.  Indeed, the odds of avoiding a cancer diagnosis do not seem very good. But read on.  Cancer Risk Factors  On the Mayo Clinic site, in an article entitled “Cancer Risk: What the Numbers Mean,” the writer explains:  “ Risk statistics can be frustrating because they can't tell you your risk of cancer. Studies may have found that men have a nearly 45
    percent chance of developing cancer in their lifetimes, but that doesn't mean your risk is 45 percent. Your individual risk is based on many different
    factors, such as age and habits (including eating habits), family history of cancer, and the environment in which you live.”  The World Health Organization (WHO), through its International Agency for Research on Cancer, classifies cancer causing agents in three main groups:   physical carcinogens (such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation)  chemical carcinogens (such as asbestos, tobacco, pesticides and arsenic )  biological carcinogens (such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Human Papilloma viral infections ,
        which increase the risk for liver or cervical cancer ).
        Infections account for a high proportion – about 18% -- of the global cancer burden.    Smoking , alcohol, physical inactivity, overweight or
    obesity, and unhealthy diet are the main cancer risk factors worldwide.   Tobacco use -- Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world; around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due
        to cancer, according to projections from Cancer Research UK. Smoking and second-hand smoke contribute to at least 14 different cancers.  Alcohol use -- According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse website, a meta-analysis of 229 studies reporting on 115,199 cases
        confirms that high levels of alcohol consumption (more than four drinks per day) result in a substantial risk of cancer development at several
        sites. Lower levels of consumption result in a moderately increased risk for various cancers. In fact, the researchers were unable to identify
        a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer is evident.  Lack of physical activity – A sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for cancer. According to the NCI website, “There is convincing
        evidence that physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of cancers of the colon and breast. Several studies also have reported links
        between physical activity and a reduced risk of cancers of the prostate, lung, and lining of the uterus.”  Being overweight or obese – Seven different cancers have known links to obesity. The 2014 Cancer Progress Report from the American
        Association for Cancer Research states that overweight/obesity is responsible for nearly 25% of cancer incidence, and the American Institute for
        Cancer Research states that more than 121,000 cases of cancer each year are caused by excess body fat. A November 2014 position statement by the
        American Society of Clinical Oncology identified obesity as "quickly overtaking tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer."  Unhealthy diet with low fruit and vegetable intake – In an article published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the author states that “Nutrient sparse foods such as concentrated
        sugars and refined flour products, …low fiber intake, consumption of red meat, and imbalance of omega 3 and omega 6 fats all contribute
        to excess cancer risk.”  Aging is another important factor in the development of cancer. That the incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age is most likely due to an accumulation
of risk factors combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as a person grows older.  Nonetheless, although we
cannot change the fact that we age, we can age healthfully.   What Can We Do About Cancer Risk?  The good news is that according to the WHO’s World Cancer Report , one-third of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk
    factors, including lifestyle factors.  And in a 2008 review published in Pharmaceutical Research , scientists at MD Anderson Cancer Center
    present even stronger evidence for prevention:  “The evidence indicates that of all cancer-related deaths...25-30% are due to tobacco, ...30-35% are linked to diet, about 15-20% are due to infections,
    and the remaining percentage are due to other factors like radiation, stress ,
    physical activity, environmental pollutants, etc.” Declaring that inflammation is the link between the factors that cause cancer and those that prevent
    it, the authors provide strong evidence that “cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes.”  Biochemist Dr. T. Colin Campbell of Cornell goes even further: His empowering research proved to him that “diet trumps carcinogens every single time.”
    The 2007 joint report of the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund included a review of over 7000 scientific studies
    by a panel of 21 world-renowned experts.  Their conclusion: diets that are protective of cancer are mainly made up from foods of plant origin.
     A diet high in fruits and vegetables has
    been associated with a decreased risk of at least 15 different types of cancer.  According to CancerResearchUK.org, an estimated 14.1 million new cases of cancer occurred worldwide in 2012, and the World Cancer Report predicts
    that global cancer rates could increase to 15 million by 2020. What’s important is not the growth of cancer worldwide or even the statistic of your
    having a one in two lifetime risk of getting cancer.  What’s important is what you can do about it through wise lifestyle choices, and whether
    you are willing to seize that challenge.   Join the conversation. Create a topic in our forum.     References:  [1] Anand P, Kunnumakara A, Sundaram C, et al. Cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes. Pharm Res 2008 Sept; 25(9):2097-2116.

We do know that radiation-induced cancers do not appear until at least 10 years after exposure (for tumors) or 2 years after exposure (for leukemia). This time after exposure to possible cancer formation is called the “latent period.” The risk of cancer after exposure can extend beyond this latent period for the rest of your life for tumors or about 30 years for leukemia. With cancer, it’s about the risk or odds (probability) of getting cancer. We make probability decisions every day based on how we feel about something—“What are the chances I’ll get a raise if I go ask the boss for one?” “I wonder if I can fit one more stop in on the way home and still be on time.” “If I have another piece of candy, will I gain weight?” Based on how you’re feeling and what the benefits might be, you weigh the odds and make a decision.  With radiation and cancer, it is much the same type of question, but in this case it looks like “What is the chance of cancer from this radiation dose ?” Whether the chance is “big” or not is a personal decision—based on your thinking about radiation and whether you think there is a benefit to you. Using the doses on our original chart, here is the percentage increase in the chance of getting cancer (keeping in mind that our everyday, ordinary risk is about 42 percent or odds of 1 in 2.4 without radiation exposure ):       Number of Cancers That Occur over a Lifetime in a Population of One Million People  Odds of Cancer (natural occurrence)    Cancer Baseline  420,000*  1 in 2.4    POSSIBLE INCREASE IN CANCER CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO RADIATION ABOVE THE NATURALLY OCCURRING BACKGROUND    Dose  # Possible Cancers if One Million People Receive That Dose  Combined Odds of Cancer (natural occurrence + the additional risk if you receive the dose in column 1**)    1 rem  421,700  1 in 2.4    10 rem  437,000  1 in 2.3    100 rem  590,000  1 in 1.7    1,000 rem  A person would die before cancer could occur         *Average male plus female lifetime incidence (http://srab.cancer.gov/devcan)  **Adapted from ICRP 2007, Appendix A, Table A14 (17 percent/Sv [or 17 percent/100 rem ] incidence)         ©2007 RadiationAnswers.org .

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

Category Cancer A-Z          Cancer Basics             Lifetime Risk of Developing or Dying From Cancer      The lifetime risk of developing or dying from cancer refers to the chance a person has, over the course of his or her lifetime (from birth to death), of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer. These risk estimates, like annual incidence and mortality data, provide another measure of how widespread cancer is in the United States.  The following tables list lifetime risks of developing and dying from certain cancers for men and women. The information is from the US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database, and is based on incidence and mortality data for the United States from 2012 through 2014, the most current years for which data are available.  The risk is expressed both in terms of a percentage and as odds.   For example, the risk that a man will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime is 3.76%. This means he has about 1 chance in 27 of developing bladder cancer (100/3.76 = 26.6).  Put another way, 1 out of every 27 men in the United States will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime.   These numbers are average risks for the overall US population. Your risk may be higher or lower than these numbers, depending on your particular risk factors.

The number of deaths was 166.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 38.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer of any site at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 14,738,719 people living with cancer of any site in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Cancer of Any Site?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  67.0%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from cancer of any site. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Who Gets This Cancer?  Overall cancer incidence rates are higher among men than women.  Among racial/ethnic groups, there are more new cases among African American men and white women and fewer new cases among Asian/Pacific Islanders of both sexes. The number of new cases of cancer of any site was 442.7 per 100,000 men and women per year based on 2010-2014 cases.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,

Cancer Statistics   Cancer Disparities                      Cancer Statistics              Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world. Cancer statistics describe what happens in large groups of people and provide a picture in time of the burden of cancer on society. Statistics tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year, the number of people who are currently living after a cancer diagnosis, the average age at diagnosis, and the numbers of people who are still alive at a given time after diagnosis. They also tell us about differences among groups defined by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, geographic location, and other categories.  If you are looking for information about chances of surviving cancer and prognosis, see the Understanding Cancer Prognosis page.      View this video on YouTube.     Information on cancer statistics, how cancer statistics are calculated, and where the data come from.   Although statistical trends are usually not directly applicable to individual patients, they are essential for governments, policy makers, health professionals, and researchers to understand the impact of cancer on the population and to develop strategies to address the challenges that cancer poses to the society at large. Statistical trends are also important for measuring the success of efforts to control and manage cancer.  Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer in the United States   In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people will die from the disease.  The most common cancers in 2016 are projected to be breast cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, prostate cancer, colon and rectum cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma of the skin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid cancer, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, leukemia, endometrial cancer, and pancreatic cancer.  The number of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence ) is 454.8 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 cases).  The number of cancer deaths (cancer mortality ) is 171.2 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 deaths).  Cancer mortality is higher among men than women (207.9 per 100,000 men and 145.4 per 100,000 women). It is highest in African American men (261.5 per 100,000) and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islander women (91.2 per 100,000). (Based on 2008-2012 deaths.)  The number of people living beyond a cancer diagnosis reached nearly 14.5 million in 2014 and is expected to rise to almost 19 million by 2024.  Approximately 39.6% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2010-2012 data).  In 2014, an estimated 15,780 children and adolescents ages 0 to 19 were diagnosed with cancer and 1,960 died of the disease.  National expenditures for cancer care in the United States totaled nearly $125 billion in 2010 and could reach $156 billion in 2020.    Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer Worldwide        Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2012, there were 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths worldwide.  The number of new cancer cases will rise to 22 million within the next two decades.  More than 60% of the world’s new cancer cases occur in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America; 70% of the world’s cancer deaths also occur in these regions.   The World Health Organization’s website has more information about cancer statistics across the world.   U.S. Cancer Mortality Trends  The best indicator of progress against cancer is a change in age-adjusted mortality (death) rates, although other measures, such as quality of life, are also important. Incidence is also important, but it is not always straightforward to interpret changes in incidence. For example, if a new screening test detects many cancer cases that would never have caused a problem during someone’s life (called overdiagnosis), the incidence of that cancer would appear to increase even though the death rates do not change. But a rise in incidence can also reflect a real increase in disease, as is the case when an increase in exposure to a risk factor causes more cases of cancer. In this scenario the increased incidence would likely lead to a rise in mortality from the cancer.        In the United States, the overall cancer death rate has declined since the early 1990s. The most recent SEER Cancer Statistics Review , updated in September 2016, shows that cancer death rates decreased by:   1.8% per year among men from 2004 to 2013  1.4% per year among women from 2004 to 2013  1.4% per year among children ages 0–19 from 2009 to 2013   Although death rates for many individual cancer types have also declined, rates for a few cancers have stabilized or even increased.  As the overall cancer death rate has declined, the number of cancer survivors has increased. These trends show that progress is being made against the disease, but much work remains. Although rates of smoking, a major cause of cancer, have declined, the U.S. population is aging, and cancer rates increase with age. Obesity, another risk factor for cancer, is also increasing.  The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program  NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from population-based cancer registries that cover approximately 28% of the U.S. population. The SEER program website has more detailed cancer statistics, including population statistics for common types of cancer, customizable graphs and tables, and interactive tools.  The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer provides an annual update of cancer incidence, mortality, and trends in the United States. This report is jointly authored by experts from NCI, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    When first diagnosed with cancer, many people ask about their prognosis. You might want to know whether your cancer is relatively easy or more difficult to cure. Your doctor can't predict the future, but can make an estimate based on other people's experiences with the same cancer.   What is a cancer survival rate?    Cancer survival rates or survival statistics tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type of cancer for a specific amount of time. Cancer statistics often use an overall five-year survival rate.  Survival rates are usually given in percentages. For instance, the overall five-year survival rate for bladder cancer is 78 percent. That means that of all people who have bladder cancer, 78 of every 100 are living five years after diagnosis. Conversely, 22 out of every 100 are dead within five years of a bladder cancer diagnosis.  Cancer survival rates are based on research from information gathered on hundreds or thousands of people with a specific cancer. An overall survival rate includes people of all ages and health conditions who have been diagnosed with your cancer, including those diagnosed very early and those diagnosed very late.  Your doctor may be able to give you more specific statistics based on your stage of cancer. For instance, 56 percent, or a little more than half, of people diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer live for at least five years after diagnosis. The five-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 5 percent.  Overall survival rates don't specify whether cancer survivors are still undergoing treatment at five years or if they've become cancer-free (achieved remission). Other types of survival rates that give more specific information include:   Disease-free survival rate. This is the number of people who have no evidence of cancer after treatment.  Progression-free survival rate. This is the number of people who have been treated for cancer and either have no signs of cancer recurrence or who have cancer that has remained stable without growing.   Cancer survival rates often use a five-year survival rate. That doesn't mean cancer can't recur beyond five years. Certain cancers can recur many years after first being found and treated. For some cancers, if it has not recurred by five years after initial diagnosis, the chance of a later recurrence is very small. Discuss your risk of a cancer recurrence with your doctor.   How are cancer survival rates used?    You and your doctor might use survival statistics to:   Understand your prognosis. The experience of other people in your same situation can give you and your doctor an idea of your prognosis — the chance your cancer will be cured. Other factors include age and general health. Your doctor uses these factors to help you understand the seriousness of your condition.   Develop a treatment plan. Statistics can also show how people with your same cancer type and stage respond to treatment. You can use this information, along with your goals for treatment, to weigh the pros and cons of each treatment option.  For instance, if two treatments give you similar chances for remission, but one has more side effects, you might choose the option with fewer side effects.  In another example, a treatment may offer a chance for a cure, but only for 1 or 2 people out of every 100. For some, these chances are promising enough to put up with side effects. For others, the chance for a cure isn't worth the treatment's side effects.  Your doctor can help you understand the benefits and risks of each treatment.

Skip to Main Content   Know Your Chances      Home About Big Picture Charts Create Custom Charts Your Chances Special Cancer Tables     Interactive Risk Charts to Put Cancer in Context  It's difficult to read a newspaper or magazine, watch television, or surf the Internet without hearing about cancer. Unfortunately, these messages are often missing basic facts needed for people to understand their chance of cancer: the magnitude of the chance and how it compares with the chance of other diseases.  Risk charts present these basic facts by showing the chance of dying from a variety of cancer and other diseases over specific time frames. Because age, sex and race are so important in determining your chances, the charts let you account for these factors. While other factors make an important difference (like smoking or having a serious disease run in your family), the numbers from the charts will get you into the right ballpark.  Get Started  Choose from one of the four risk charts offered below.         Big Picture Charts  Ready made charts with the 10-year chance of dying from major causes.  View The Charts   Create Custom Charts  Select the causes of death and time frame for the chart.  Design A Chart   Your Chances  Display the chances of dying from the most common causes based on age, race and sex.  View Your Chances   Special Cancer Tables  Compare the risk of diagnosis and death for specific cancers.  View Comparisons         DISCLAIMER: The charts do not account for some individual characteristics that affect the chance of death, most importantly smoking. Smoking substantially increases the chance of dying from heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and all-causes combined. If you smoke, your chances of dying from these causes are higher than those shown in the charts - and if you never smoked, your chances of dying are lower.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    You might wonder about your chances of developing cancer. News reports can make it sound as if every day something is found to dramatically raise your risk. Sorting through all the information and figuring out what's valid can be tricky.   What is risk?    When scientists talk about risk, they're referring to a probability — the chance that something may occur, but not a guarantee that it will. For example, if you flip a coin, there is one chance in two, or a 50 percent chance, that the coin will land heads up.  Risk estimates for cancer and other diseases are determined by studying large groups of people. Researchers focus on the probability that any person or category of people will develop the disease over a certain period of time. They also look to see what characteristics or behaviors are associated with increased or decreased risk.   How is risk expressed?      Absolute risk        Relative risk    Risk is generally divided into two categories: absolute risk and relative risk.  Absolute risk  Absolute risk refers to the actual numeric chance or probability of developing cancer during a specified time period — for example, within the year, within the next five years, by age 50, by age 70, or during the course of a lifetime.  One type of absolute risk is lifetime risk, which is the probability that an individual will develop cancer during the course of a lifetime. For instance, an American man's absolute risk of developing prostate cancer in his lifetime is about 12 percent. Put another way, about 12 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some time in their lives. This also means that 88 out of every 100 men won't develop prostate cancer.  Lifetime risk isn't the risk that a person will develop cancer in the next year or the next five years. An individual's cancer risk has a lot to do with other factors, such as age. For instance, a woman's lifetime risk of developing colon and rectal cancer is just over 4 percent, or about 42 out of every 1,000 women. But her risk of developing colon and rectal cancer before the age of 50 is 0.3 percent, or about 3 out of every 1,000 women.  Relative risk  Relative risk gives you a comparison or ratio rather than an absolute value. It shows the strength of the relationship between a risk factor and a particular type of cancer by comparing the number of cancers in a group of people who have a particular trait with the number of cancers in a group of people who don't have that trait.  For instance, compare the relative lung cancer risk for people who smoke with the relative lung cancer risk in a similar group of people who don't smoke. You might hear relative risk being expressed like this: The risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25 times higher than the risk for people who don't smoke. So the relative risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25.  Relative risk is also given as a percentage. For example, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is 2,500 percent higher than it is for people who don't smoke.  When you hear about relative risk, there's no upper limit to the percentage increase in risk. Most people think 100 percent is the highest possible risk, but that isn't true in this case.  A relative risk of 100 percent means your risk is twice as high as that of someone without that risk factor. A 200 percent relative risk means that you are three times as likely to develop that condition.  Risk seems greater when put in these terms. A 100 percent increase in risk may seem enormous, but if the risk began as 1 in 100 people, a 100 percent increase in risk means that 2 out of 100 will be affected.

What Are Your Chances of Getting Cancer?                What Are Your Chances of Getting Cancer?  2015 - 07 - 21     A few days ago a supporter wrote, “My teammate shared this image on Facebook and got slammed
    by someone calling it ‘misinformed,’’misleading’ and ‘junk science.’ I have no idea where I could find the truth, and I thought perhaps you could point
    me in the right direction.” As my late friend Dr. David Kritchevsky, former Associate Director of Wistar Institute, quipped, “If you torture the statistics
    long enough they’ll confess.”  So should we trust those statistics?  I have not found a source for lifetime cancer risk in 1900, but the later data seem to have originated from the website of Cancer Research of the United
    Kingdom (cancerresearchuk.org), which states: “In 1975 the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer in the UK was one in four people; by the 1990s it had risen to one in three, and by 2010 it was four in 10.” That means that the risk of getting cancer
    is now close to one in two.  Similar data come from the SEER Cancer Statistics Review released April 23, 2015.  The Review, a report of the most recent cancer incidence, mortality,
    survival, prevalence, and lifetime risk statistics, is published annually by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The latest edition includes statistics
    from 1975 through 2012, the most recent year for which data are available. For all sites, the lifetime risk was again declared to be four in 10.  That figure is corroborated by the American Cancer Society website, which states that the risk of developing cancer for all invasive cancer sites is one
    in two for males and one in three for females.  Indeed, the odds of avoiding a cancer diagnosis do not seem very good. But read on.  Cancer Risk Factors  On the Mayo Clinic site, in an article entitled “Cancer Risk: What the Numbers Mean,” the writer explains:  “ Risk statistics can be frustrating because they can't tell you your risk of cancer. Studies may have found that men have a nearly 45
    percent chance of developing cancer in their lifetimes, but that doesn't mean your risk is 45 percent. Your individual risk is based on many different
    factors, such as age and habits (including eating habits), family history of cancer, and the environment in which you live.”  The World Health Organization (WHO), through its International Agency for Research on Cancer, classifies cancer causing agents in three main groups:   physical carcinogens (such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation)  chemical carcinogens (such as asbestos, tobacco, pesticides and arsenic )  biological carcinogens (such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Human Papilloma viral infections ,
        which increase the risk for liver or cervical cancer ).
        Infections account for a high proportion – about 18% -- of the global cancer burden.    Smoking , alcohol, physical inactivity, overweight or
    obesity, and unhealthy diet are the main cancer risk factors worldwide.   Tobacco use -- Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world; around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due
        to cancer, according to projections from Cancer Research UK. Smoking and second-hand smoke contribute to at least 14 different cancers.  Alcohol use -- According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse website, a meta-analysis of 229 studies reporting on 115,199 cases
        confirms that high levels of alcohol consumption (more than four drinks per day) result in a substantial risk of cancer development at several
        sites. Lower levels of consumption result in a moderately increased risk for various cancers. In fact, the researchers were unable to identify
        a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer is evident.  Lack of physical activity – A sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for cancer. According to the NCI website, “There is convincing
        evidence that physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of cancers of the colon and breast. Several studies also have reported links
        between physical activity and a reduced risk of cancers of the prostate, lung, and lining of the uterus.”  Being overweight or obese – Seven different cancers have known links to obesity. The 2014 Cancer Progress Report from the American
        Association for Cancer Research states that overweight/obesity is responsible for nearly 25% of cancer incidence, and the American Institute for
        Cancer Research states that more than 121,000 cases of cancer each year are caused by excess body fat. A November 2014 position statement by the
        American Society of Clinical Oncology identified obesity as "quickly overtaking tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer."  Unhealthy diet with low fruit and vegetable intake – In an article published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the author states that “Nutrient sparse foods such as concentrated
        sugars and refined flour products, …low fiber intake, consumption of red meat, and imbalance of omega 3 and omega 6 fats all contribute
        to excess cancer risk.”  Aging is another important factor in the development of cancer. That the incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age is most likely due to an accumulation
of risk factors combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as a person grows older.  Nonetheless, although we
cannot change the fact that we age, we can age healthfully.   What Can We Do About Cancer Risk?  The good news is that according to the WHO’s World Cancer Report , one-third of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk
    factors, including lifestyle factors.  And in a 2008 review published in Pharmaceutical Research , scientists at MD Anderson Cancer Center
    present even stronger evidence for prevention:  “The evidence indicates that of all cancer-related deaths...25-30% are due to tobacco, ...30-35% are linked to diet, about 15-20% are due to infections,
    and the remaining percentage are due to other factors like radiation, stress ,
    physical activity, environmental pollutants, etc.” Declaring that inflammation is the link between the factors that cause cancer and those that prevent
    it, the authors provide strong evidence that “cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes.”  Biochemist Dr. T. Colin Campbell of Cornell goes even further: His empowering research proved to him that “diet trumps carcinogens every single time.”
    The 2007 joint report of the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund included a review of over 7000 scientific studies
    by a panel of 21 world-renowned experts.  Their conclusion: diets that are protective of cancer are mainly made up from foods of plant origin.
     A diet high in fruits and vegetables has
    been associated with a decreased risk of at least 15 different types of cancer.  According to CancerResearchUK.org, an estimated 14.1 million new cases of cancer occurred worldwide in 2012, and the World Cancer Report predicts
    that global cancer rates could increase to 15 million by 2020. What’s important is not the growth of cancer worldwide or even the statistic of your
    having a one in two lifetime risk of getting cancer.  What’s important is what you can do about it through wise lifestyle choices, and whether
    you are willing to seize that challenge.   Join the conversation. Create a topic in our forum.     References:  [1] Anand P, Kunnumakara A, Sundaram C, et al. Cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes. Pharm Res 2008 Sept; 25(9):2097-2116.

We do know that radiation-induced cancers do not appear until at least 10 years after exposure (for tumors) or 2 years after exposure (for leukemia). This time after exposure to possible cancer formation is called the “latent period.” The risk of cancer after exposure can extend beyond this latent period for the rest of your life for tumors or about 30 years for leukemia. With cancer, it’s about the risk or odds (probability) of getting cancer. We make probability decisions every day based on how we feel about something—“What are the chances I’ll get a raise if I go ask the boss for one?” “I wonder if I can fit one more stop in on the way home and still be on time.” “If I have another piece of candy, will I gain weight?” Based on how you’re feeling and what the benefits might be, you weigh the odds and make a decision.  With radiation and cancer, it is much the same type of question, but in this case it looks like “What is the chance of cancer from this radiation dose ?” Whether the chance is “big” or not is a personal decision—based on your thinking about radiation and whether you think there is a benefit to you. Using the doses on our original chart, here is the percentage increase in the chance of getting cancer (keeping in mind that our everyday, ordinary risk is about 42 percent or odds of 1 in 2.4 without radiation exposure ):       Number of Cancers That Occur over a Lifetime in a Population of One Million People  Odds of Cancer (natural occurrence)    Cancer Baseline  420,000*  1 in 2.4    POSSIBLE INCREASE IN CANCER CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO RADIATION ABOVE THE NATURALLY OCCURRING BACKGROUND    Dose  # Possible Cancers if One Million People Receive That Dose  Combined Odds of Cancer (natural occurrence + the additional risk if you receive the dose in column 1**)    1 rem  421,700  1 in 2.4    10 rem  437,000  1 in 2.3    100 rem  590,000  1 in 1.7    1,000 rem  A person would die before cancer could occur         *Average male plus female lifetime incidence (http://srab.cancer.gov/devcan)  **Adapted from ICRP 2007, Appendix A, Table A14 (17 percent/Sv [or 17 percent/100 rem ] incidence)         ©2007 RadiationAnswers.org .

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.
