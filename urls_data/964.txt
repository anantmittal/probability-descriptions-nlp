Tony Gutierrez/Associated Press The Oklahoma Sooners played their way into the College Football Playoffs even though they struggled on defense for the majority of the season. The Georgia Bulldogs have gotten there primarily because they have an overpowering defense and an effective ground game. Georgia allowed 13.2 points per game this season, ranking fourth in the nation for head coach Kirby Smart. Oklahoma head coach Lincoln Riley is an offensive mastermind. He took over the role in June when Bob Stoops retired prior to the start of the season, and he put together an offense that has scored 44.9 points per game. When quarterback Baker Mayfield won the Heisman Trophy last Saturday, he thanked everyone who helped in his development. He thanked Stoops for giving him his opportunity to play at Oklahoma and for " hiring Coach Riley ." Smart knows his defensive troops are going to have a difficult assignment trying to contain Mayfield. "It's really almost like when you would watch Brett Favre back in the day," Smart said in a teleconference, per John Durham of The Red and Black . "Obviously he's a better athlete, but he's got the gunslinger mentality to make all the throws. He enjoys the game and plays the game with so much passion." UGA Football Live  @ UGAfootballLive "To see Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, Roquan Smith, hugging on the stage in tears because they care about each other so much, that's why I do this." -- Kirby Smart https://t.co/QIrvpYjeAY Georgia's running attack dovetails nicely with its defensive strength. Nick Chubb and Sony Michel are the team's primary ball-carriers, with D'Andre Swift adding an element of explosive speed to Chubb's power and Michel's versatility. "I don't know if we've seen anybody with the caliber of the backs that they have there. ... It's certainly going to be a big challenge for us here for the quality of backs Georgia has," Riley said in the teleconference on Dec. 3. Oklahoma's defense is a work in progress, and it will be tested severely by the Bulldogs. The Sooners gave up 31 points or more five times this season, and that unit is likely to have a difficult time with Georgia. If the Georgia running attack has success, it should be able to keep Mayfield and the Oklahoma offense on the sidelines more than Riley would like. If the Bulldogs can keep the ball on long drives, that will keep the defense fresh. That's a huge factor because if highly regarded Georgia linebacker Roquan Smith does not get overworked, he has as good a chance as anyone of at least slowing down Mayfield. Smith has 113 tackles, 10.5 tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks this season, and when he can turn the corner on the pass rush, he is nearly impossible to stop. The oddsmakers have given the Bulldogs the edge in the game, favoring them by two points, according to OddsShark . However, they don't believe that defense will rule the day. The total in the game is 60 points, 13 more than the Alabama-Clemson semifinal.

During the regular season, the Bulldogs stumbled once in a 40-17 blowout loss to Auburn then avenged their only defeat in the SEC Championship Game to solidify a spot in the top four. Throughout the year, Georgia has dominated its competition, for the most part, winning 11 out of 12 contests by double-digit margins. Oklahoma garnered early spotlight with quarterback Baker Mayfield under center. The senior signal-caller went on to win the Heisman Trophy with 4,430 passing yards and 41 touchdown passes to only five interceptions. The offense earned praise with every high-scoring output and finished No. 4 nationally in points. Which team will smell the roses and advance to the CFP national championship game when it's all said and done? Here are the odds and viewing information for the 2018 Rose Bowl matchup:  Date: Monday, January 1 Time: 5 p.m. ET Location: Rose Bowl, Pasadena, CA TV: ESPN Odds: Oklahoma (-1.5) via OddsShark Live stream:  WatchESPN  Prediction Brett Deering/Getty Images Don't worry about Mayfield missing out on extra-curricular activities with his teammates throughout the week. According to ESPN.com reporter Kyle Bonagura , the Heisman winner still went through practices before addressing the media Saturday, per ESPN.com writer Arash Markazi: Arash Markazi  @ ArashMarkazi Baker Mayfield is still battling a flu two days before the Rose Bowl. https://t.co/3qo7492iQa As long as Mayfield's offensive line continues to provide protection as they've done all year, the Sooners signal-caller will have some highlight moments throwing the football against Georgia. Mayfield's ability to move outside the pocket and pinpoint accuracy will frustrate the Bulldogs secondary resulting in a few blown assignments. As a big target downfield junior wideout Mark Andrews should have a productive day—potentially his fourth 100-yard receiving performance in 2017. Brett Deering/Getty Images It's also worth mentioning Sooners running back Rodney Anderson will suit up after a ruling on his legal matters, per ESPN.com reporter Jake Trotter : " The district attorney's office for Cleveland County, Oklahoma, determined that criminal charges were not warranted against University of Oklahoma running back Rodney Anderson after a police investigation into whether he sexually assaulted a woman who filed an emergency protective order against him. " Anderson provides balance to the Sooners' explosive offense. He's registered five 100-yard performances during the regular season. Jamie Squire/Getty Images Georgia signal-caller Jake Fromm will pick and choose his spots after handing off several times to Nick Chubb and Sony Michel, who have a combined 2,123 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns apiece this season. In order to secure a win, the backfield duo must control the game flow to minimize Oklahoma's time of possession. At times, we've witnessed weaknesses within the Sooners front seven. Oklahoma State running back Justice Hill gashed this defense for 228 rushing yards. Without much of a passing attack, West Virginia ball-carriers Kennedy McKoy and Justin Crawford combined for 234 yards on the ground against Oklahoma. Kevin C.  Cox/Getty Images If Chubb and Michel find success early, Fromm will see the field open up as the game progresses, which will allow him to take shots to his receivers downfield. Mayfield will outplay Fromm on the big stage, but the Bulldogs ground attack should serve as the equalizer on offense. Georgia's defense ranks No. 4 in the country, but this program hasn't seen an offensive unit comparable to Oklahoma's group. The Bulldogs need takeaways to tilt the game in their favor. They're not going to force many three-and-outs without yielding scores through the air. Keep in mind Mayfield has only thrown five interceptions, which occurred in a streak of four games. He's yet to throw a pick since his outing with Oklahoma State. Oklahoma wins this contest pulling away in the fourth quarter with its aerial attack finding holes in Georgia's secondary. Chubb and Michel will experience early success but fade after the Sooners make second-half adjustments.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Brett Deering/Getty Images      The 2018 Rose Bowl between No. 3 Georgia and No. 2 Oklahoma has the potential to be one for the ages. This College Football Playoff semifinal may not have the look of a traditional Rose Bowl—it’s the first in 15 years that won’t feature a Pac-12 or Big Ten team—but fans likely won’t mind too much if the game lives up to the hype. This matchup may not have the rivalry factor or history between the participants that tonight’s rubber match between Clemson and Alabama boasts, but the on-field excitement in the Granddaddy Of Them All should be second-to-none. You can read more about the Sugar Bowl, the other College Football Playoff game tonight, by clicking here .  Oddsmakers are expecting a close contest, having opened betting with Georgia as the slightest of favorites at -1 before moving the line to UGA -3 ( update 4:30 p.m. ET: the line is now UGA -2) after early sharp action. It’s the smallest spread of the any of the New Year’s Six bowl games, but also has the second-largest total—61—of any of those major matchups. That game could easily play in the 30’s for both teams, with Vegas expecting a high-scoring, back-and-forth battle that may come down to the wire.

Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has a lean on this game that you won’t want to miss.

Participating in the oldest and most prestigious bowl game with the chance to play for a national title at stake makes this a truly special game, one that both sides will be going all out to try and win. It's an old fashioned offense versus defense showdown, with Georgia hoping that its top-tier D can shut down an unstoppable Oklahoma attack in the Rose Bowl.  The UGA defense has blossomed under second-year coach Kirby Smart. The former Alabama defensive coordinator has helped transform this program into a juggernaut on that side of the ball. Led by star linebacker Roquan Smith—a player many believe is the best overall defender in the entire country—the ‘Dawgs rank as the No. 4 defense in the nation, giving up an average of only 271 yards per game to opponents and letting just two—Auburn and Missouri—eclipse the 300-yard mark. This unit will face its toughest test yet in the Rose Bowl, as it is tasked with slowing down an offense that was second-to-none in 2017.  Not many expected Oklahoma to improve as much as it has following the unexpected departure of head coach Bob Stoops, but he left the program in great hands with former offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley. The 34-year-old has been a boon for the program, especially in terms of developing Baker Mayfield into a superstar and modernizing the offense. OU averaged 583.3 yards per game offensively and there were only three occasions in which the Sooners failed to reach the 500-yard mark this season. There was not a single game in whic they went below 460 yards either. This consistency is a large reason why OU produced a Heisman winner—Mayfield garnered 732 first-place votes, 657 more than runner-up Bryce Love—that has connected on 262-of-369 passes (71%) for 4,340 yards and 41 touchdowns against a mere five interceptions.

It's a complete clash of styles: the Sooners spread you out and have one of college football 's best scoring offenses, while the Bulldogs crush opponents with the ground game and run more than just about any other team on first down (80.5 percent). Not only that, but both offenses are built to exploit the other's weakness, so this should be a fun matchup. Both teams are led by first-time coaches, meaning either Lincoln Riley or Kirby Smart will be playing for a national championship next week, and both have the team to win it all, too. Viewing information Date: Monday, Jan. 1 | Time: 5 p.m. ET Location: Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, California TV: ESPN | Live stream:  Watch ESPN , Watch ESPN apps Storylines Oklahoma: Quarterback Baker Mayfield has been battling an illness this week . While that likely won't affect his status for the game, it is something to monitor. But given Mayfield's tendency to get up for big games, this could literally be his own "Flu Game" a la Michael Jordan. Mayfield can also further cement his legacy as one of college football's best quarterbacks -- he's already won the Heisman Trophy -- by at least getting to the national championship.    Georgia: Georgia has grown into one of the premier jobs in college football given the rise of blue-chip, in-state talent in recent years. However, this playoff appearance is still one of firsts for the Bulldogs. As the great Berry Tramel wrote , Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm could be the first true freshman quarterback to win a national championship since (of all people) former Oklahoma quarterback Jamelle Holieway did it in 1985. Smart is a second-year coach and has been the one good recent example of an SEC program successfully plucking the Nick Saban coaching tree. To have a shot to make history, though, it needs to get past the Sooners. Prediction The over/under for this game is now at 60, and the over still seems appealing given how well these two offenses work. That would seemingly play into Oklahoma's favor. And if there's one thing Mayfield has proved, it's that it is hard to bet against him. This one is setting up to be a classic.

Jaime Squire/Getty Images             Connor Riley    Posted 3 months ago                   The Georgia Bulldogs take on the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2018 Rose Bowl on Monday, Jan. 1. Below find betting odds, picks and predictions for the game.  Georgia enters the game with a 12-1 record and avenged its only loss by beating Auburn in the SEC Championship game. Oklahoma also went 12-1 and beat TCU in the Big 12 championship game.          Georgia-Oklahoma betting: Odds for the 2018 College Football Playoff  Line: Georgia is a 1.5-favorite over Oklahoma in the 2018 College Football Playoff.  Line/Spread: The over/under for the 2018 College Football Playoff game is 60.  Georgia-Oklahoma betting: Picks and Predictions for the 2018 College Football Playoff  The predictions come from the SECCountry.com breaking news team.  Connor Riley: Oklahoma will undoubtedly be the best offense Georgia has played this season. The Sooners have perhaps the best offensive player in college football in Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield. But Georgia is able to counter with Roquan Smith, who won the 2017 Butkus award given to the best linebacker. And Georgia has the best defense Oklahoma has seen all season.  But the real difference in the game will be when Georgia has the ball on offense. Georgia has rushed for at least 200 yards in all but two games this year, and that ability, coupled with Oklahoma’s middle of the pack rush defense, will allow the Bulldogs to keep Mayfield and the Sooner offense off the field.  Score: Georgia 35, Oklahoma 27          S penser Davis : There are several different individual matchups that could play a big role in this game, and Georgia has the edge in most of them. But when it comes to the quarterback, Oklahoma has an emphatic advantage with Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield. Georgia QB Jake Fromm has proven to be capable, but he’s a true freshman and hasn’t performed under the bright lights of a College Football Playoff like Mayfield has. Because of that intangibles advantage and historic offensive firepower, the Sooners have a great shot to emerge victorious in the Rose Bowl. And one more thing: Don’t discount the OU defense — Georgia’s run game is exactly the kind of offense Mike Stoops loves to scheme for. The Sooners could very well turn in their best defensive performance of the season against the Bulldogs.  Score: Oklahoma 35, Georgia 29   Brian Stultz: Georgia’s defense taking on Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield is the best matchup of either playoff games. The Bulldogs have made most offenses look bad this season, but the Sooners are on another level. The rushing duo of Nick Chubb and Sony Michel will put up points, but in the end, Oklahoma pulls out a classic victory to make the title game.   Corey Knapp: Oklahoma scoring first and then getting out to a two-touchdown lead will be a key for the Sooners, as Georgia has rarely had to play from multiple scores down at all this season, and when it did — first Auburn game — it wasn’t pretty. If the Bulldogs defense can withstand the surge — and there will be a surge or two — from Baker Mayfield and then begin to dictate the line of scrimmage, that will be the difference in the game. Same goes for the other side of the ball in terms of Georgia’s offensive line taking control and wearing down the Sooners defensive front. A close, moderately high-scoring game into the fourth quarter, when Georgia pulls away on the strength of its lines and running backs.   A ndrew Astleford: It all comes down to Baker Mayfield vs. Georgia’s defense, which is the best matchup of the College Football Playoff. Mayfield will make plays, and Oklahoma will score points. But stellar linebacker Roquan Smith and the rest of the Bulldogs’ defense will come up with enough stops to allow Georgia to earn a spot in the national championship game.

Betting Line / Total: Georgia -2 / 60 Points  Bulldogs vs. Sooners OddsShark Matchup Report   Oklahoma Sooners  Baker Mayfield's decision to return for his senior season at Oklahoma proved to be a wise one. The superstar gunslinger set career highs across the board with 4,340 passing yards and 41 passing touchdowns and only five interceptions en route to securing the Heisman Trophy.  Three of the top four scoring defenses in the nation make up the rest of the field in this year's College Football Playoff and will give Mayfield a chance to cement his legacy against some of the sport's very best units.  Since Oct. 1 of 2016, the Sooners have amassed a 22-1 SU and 15-8 ATS record, per the OddsShark College Football Database .   Georgia Bulldogs  Georgia averaged 34.9 points per game on offense this season and allowed only 13.2 points per game, giving the Bulldogs on average margin of 21.7 points per game.  The Bulldogs dominated most of the games on their schedule in going 12-1 SU and 9-4 ATS and had a chance to avenge their only loss in the SEC Championship Game with a 28-7 victory over Auburn. The betting favorite is 7-2 SU in the last nine Rose Bowl matchups, and Georgia is 9-3 SU in its last 12 games played in January.  Monday's total is set at 60 points. The UNDER is 7-1 in Oklahoma's last eight games against SEC opponents.  While this matchup is being touted for the exciting clash of an Oklahoma pass attack that ranks third in the nation vs. a Georgia pass defense that ranks second in the nation, that is only one element of an overall great game between two excellent teams. Regardless of which side of the offense vs. defense argument you land on, this has the makings of an instant classic that is decided on the last drive of the game.

This is as compelling as it gets because every team has a legitimate shot to win it all. With that in mind, allow me to lay out a few reasons why No. 2 Oklahoma will go on to beat Georgia and ultimately win the national championship. Some reasons are simple. For example, the Sooners had college football 's most outstanding player this season. Some require a little more digging. You'd be hard-pressed to find a positive thing to say about this defense. Still, Oklahoma -- led by first-year coach Lincoln Riley, the youngest in college football -- is in the show. The only thing separating it from a national title is two more games. Here's how the Sooners can make that happen. 1. The Sooners have this player ... you may have heard of him: His name rhymes with Maker Bayfield, and he was only the 2017 Heisman Trophy winner. You know, no big deal. Say what you will about Mayfield's on-field, ahem, "cockiness" and off-field "issues" (if you want to go so far as to call them that), the man has been at his best when the most is on the line. In his four biggest games this season (vs. Ohio State , Oklahoma State and TCU twice), Mayfield has 1,560 passing yards at 12.6 yards per attempt with a 15-2 TD-to-INT ratio. Keep in mind, too, that Ohio State and TCU are top-15 defenses, per Football Outsiders. Mayfield also leads PFF's quarterback passer rating with a score of 137.9 and ranks sixth with 29 "big-time throws." So while Georgia and potentially Alabama or Clemson would be the toughest defenses he's faced this season, the numbers say he's up to the task.    The case for ... No. 1 Clemson No. 3 Georgia No. 4 Alabama 2. Oklahoma has college football's best, most diverse offense: Now that you know everything about Mayfield's impact, it's time to tell you that the Sooners aren't a one-man show -- even if it feels like it sometimes. The Sooners have the top offense in every S&P+ category and are actually more efficient this year without the trio of Dede Westbrook , Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon. In particular, PFF loves this offense's skill players. Running back Rodney Anderson , who has been unstoppable in the second half of the season, ranks 14th in explosive run rate percentage. Receivers Jeff Badet, Mykel Jones and CeeDee Lamb rank in the top 15 nationally, respectively, in wide receiver rating* and in the top 10 in offensive success rating (i.e. the percentage of targets that go for a positive play). Additionally, Marquise Brown , the team's leading receiver with 981 yards, averages 20 yards per reception. That's fourth-best among receivers who have at least 40 catches on the season. Take a look at how PFF has them ranked among wideouts with 200+ snaps. Oklahoma WR Rec. Yds. TDs Pos. Rating (rank) Success Rate % (rank) Jeff Badet 27 400 3 150 (2) 59.4 (7) CeeDee Lamb 39 724 7 140.8 (4) 59.3 (8) Mykel Jones 16 310 1 135.4 (12) 65 (3) Marquise Brown 50 987 6 131.9 (20) 48.6 (75) Mark Andrews , the Mackey Award winner for top tight end, is a mismatch with 58 receptions, second-most among tight ends. The reason why Oklahoma's offense is so successful is because it has Mayfield distributing the ball to so many weapons that it's impossible to shut down every option. If you get into a shootout with this team, it's not likely that you're going to outscore them. 3. The defense isn't good, but it can be disruptive in spots: The old adage stands that "defense wins championships." That's a little misleading as it's actually the right kind of defense that wins championships. In Oklahoma's case, using speed to disrupt an offense's rhythm is what it does best. Otherwise, there's no way to spin it: OU's defense just isn't that good. Yes, playing potent Big 12 offenses has something to do with the raw numbers, but even when you adjust for efficiency there's not much to like. But here's what the Sooners do have: a mostly-veteran group capable of well-timed disruption. That's going to be particularly important against Georgia in the Rose Bowl semifinal because the key to beating the Bulldogs' offense is to get them out of their comfort zone and behind the chains. Sooners edge rusher Ogbonnia Okoronkwo ranks fourth overall by PFF and actually grades out better against the run than the pass. The defensive line as a whole is best in passing situations when it can tee off and get to the quarterback. At linebacker, Caleb Kelly is a bright young star who can fill gaps and win one-on-one in space. So while there's no way around the fact that Oklahoma will give up yards and have to win in higher scoring games, it is capable of making enough plays to give its offense a chance.

I kept going back-and-forth on this pick all week, but ultimately, I can't get Oklahoma's stomping of Ohio State and Georgia's blowout loss in its first meeting against Auburn off my mind. The Sooners took care of business against the best defense they played this season, while the Bulldogs needed a second matchup to adjust to the Tigers' offense. There are no second chances here, and the experienced Baker Mayfield will ultimately be too much for Georgia to handle over 60 minutes.              Mike Tierney  Top Dog      Mon 1/1  Mon 1/1            UNDER 61 UNDER 61   Georgia 54 vs Oklahoma 48 1/01  UGA 54 vs OKLA 48 1/01     LOSS      ROSE BOWL (Pasadena, Calif.) -- You might have heard that Oklahoma QB Blake Mayfield is fighting flu-like symptoms. A media appearance Saturday morning could not hide the effects of his illness. Heisman Trophy winners endure such challenges to play, and Mayfield will. Still I suspect first-year Sooners coach Lincoln Riley will ease his burden by summoning more running plays. So, don?t look for OU to go hog-wild offensively. Georgia, similarly, will lean more on upper-class RBs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel than on true freshman QB Jake Fromm, as solid as he?s been. The Okies have been Under in five of the past six bowls, albeit under departed coach Bob Stoops, and I anticipate more of the same in a razor-thin win for the Under.              Barrett Sallee  CFB Guru      Thu 12/28  Thu 12/28            Georgia -2.5 UGA -2.5   Georgia 54 vs Oklahoma 48 1/01  UGA 54 vs OKLA 48 1/01     WIN      ROSE BOWL (Pasadena, Calif.) -- Don't buy into the notion that Bulldog quarterback Jake Fromm can't win with his arm. He can. He just doesn't have to most of the time, thanks to the punishing Bulldog running game and a defense that's fast, physical and deep. That defense will force some mistakes from Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield, the Bulldog offense will put together long drives against an overmatched Sooner defense and Georgia will win by double digits.              Emory Hunt  The Czar of the Playbook      Tue 12/19  Tue 12/19            Georgia -2 UGA -2   Georgia 54 vs Oklahoma 48 1/01  UGA 54 vs OKLA 48 1/01     WIN      ROSE BOWL (Pasadena, Calif.) -- Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield has done more than enough to make his Sooners a serious player in this playoff. Georgia, despite its one-dimensional approach, is very good at taking the air out of the ball and playing great defense The Bullodgs will force Mayfield to maximize his opportunities with the ball, which will lead to him pressing and making some mistakes.              Kenny White  Wizard of Odds      Tue 12/5  Tue 12/5            Oklahoma +1.5 OKLA +1.5   Georgia 54 vs Oklahoma 48 1/01  UGA 54 vs OKLA 48 1/01     LOSS      ROSE BOWL (Pasadena, Calif.) -- This is going to be a great game of contrasting styles. Georgia is going to try to pound the ball down OU's throat with a very strong running game, however, I prefer the balanced offense Oklahoma will throw at Georgia. I'm banking on the maestro, Baker Mayfield. QB is the most important position on the field and while Jake Fromm is really good, he's really young. Mayfield completed 71 percent of his passes for an amazing 11.76 yards per pass, with 41 touchdowns and just 5 interceptions. Those are stats that legends are made of. Mayfield has already seen Ohio State and TCU twice, so he will be well prepared for Georgia's stout defense. Oklahoma's defense is far better than the stats indicate. I give the Sooners the 18th-best defense in the nation. They score so many points and play in a high-scoring conference with Oklahoma State, Texas Tech and West Virginia. Take out the Oklahoma State game when the Sooners allowed 52 points and 661 yards -- and still won -- and the numbers look different. The Sooners will stack the box and force the young Fromm to beat them.

Tony Gutierrez/Associated Press The Oklahoma Sooners played their way into the College Football Playoffs even though they struggled on defense for the majority of the season. The Georgia Bulldogs have gotten there primarily because they have an overpowering defense and an effective ground game. Georgia allowed 13.2 points per game this season, ranking fourth in the nation for head coach Kirby Smart. Oklahoma head coach Lincoln Riley is an offensive mastermind. He took over the role in June when Bob Stoops retired prior to the start of the season, and he put together an offense that has scored 44.9 points per game. When quarterback Baker Mayfield won the Heisman Trophy last Saturday, he thanked everyone who helped in his development. He thanked Stoops for giving him his opportunity to play at Oklahoma and for " hiring Coach Riley ." Smart knows his defensive troops are going to have a difficult assignment trying to contain Mayfield. "It's really almost like when you would watch Brett Favre back in the day," Smart said in a teleconference, per John Durham of The Red and Black . "Obviously he's a better athlete, but he's got the gunslinger mentality to make all the throws. He enjoys the game and plays the game with so much passion." UGA Football Live  @ UGAfootballLive "To see Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, Roquan Smith, hugging on the stage in tears because they care about each other so much, that's why I do this." -- Kirby Smart https://t.co/QIrvpYjeAY Georgia's running attack dovetails nicely with its defensive strength. Nick Chubb and Sony Michel are the team's primary ball-carriers, with D'Andre Swift adding an element of explosive speed to Chubb's power and Michel's versatility. "I don't know if we've seen anybody with the caliber of the backs that they have there. ... It's certainly going to be a big challenge for us here for the quality of backs Georgia has," Riley said in the teleconference on Dec. 3. Oklahoma's defense is a work in progress, and it will be tested severely by the Bulldogs. The Sooners gave up 31 points or more five times this season, and that unit is likely to have a difficult time with Georgia. If the Georgia running attack has success, it should be able to keep Mayfield and the Oklahoma offense on the sidelines more than Riley would like. If the Bulldogs can keep the ball on long drives, that will keep the defense fresh. That's a huge factor because if highly regarded Georgia linebacker Roquan Smith does not get overworked, he has as good a chance as anyone of at least slowing down Mayfield. Smith has 113 tackles, 10.5 tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks this season, and when he can turn the corner on the pass rush, he is nearly impossible to stop. The oddsmakers have given the Bulldogs the edge in the game, favoring them by two points, according to OddsShark . However, they don't believe that defense will rule the day. The total in the game is 60 points, 13 more than the Alabama-Clemson semifinal.

During the regular season, the Bulldogs stumbled once in a 40-17 blowout loss to Auburn then avenged their only defeat in the SEC Championship Game to solidify a spot in the top four. Throughout the year, Georgia has dominated its competition, for the most part, winning 11 out of 12 contests by double-digit margins. Oklahoma garnered early spotlight with quarterback Baker Mayfield under center. The senior signal-caller went on to win the Heisman Trophy with 4,430 passing yards and 41 touchdown passes to only five interceptions. The offense earned praise with every high-scoring output and finished No. 4 nationally in points. Which team will smell the roses and advance to the CFP national championship game when it's all said and done? Here are the odds and viewing information for the 2018 Rose Bowl matchup:  Date: Monday, January 1 Time: 5 p.m. ET Location: Rose Bowl, Pasadena, CA TV: ESPN Odds: Oklahoma (-1.5) via OddsShark Live stream:  WatchESPN  Prediction Brett Deering/Getty Images Don't worry about Mayfield missing out on extra-curricular activities with his teammates throughout the week. According to ESPN.com reporter Kyle Bonagura , the Heisman winner still went through practices before addressing the media Saturday, per ESPN.com writer Arash Markazi: Arash Markazi  @ ArashMarkazi Baker Mayfield is still battling a flu two days before the Rose Bowl. https://t.co/3qo7492iQa As long as Mayfield's offensive line continues to provide protection as they've done all year, the Sooners signal-caller will have some highlight moments throwing the football against Georgia. Mayfield's ability to move outside the pocket and pinpoint accuracy will frustrate the Bulldogs secondary resulting in a few blown assignments. As a big target downfield junior wideout Mark Andrews should have a productive day—potentially his fourth 100-yard receiving performance in 2017. Brett Deering/Getty Images It's also worth mentioning Sooners running back Rodney Anderson will suit up after a ruling on his legal matters, per ESPN.com reporter Jake Trotter : " The district attorney's office for Cleveland County, Oklahoma, determined that criminal charges were not warranted against University of Oklahoma running back Rodney Anderson after a police investigation into whether he sexually assaulted a woman who filed an emergency protective order against him. " Anderson provides balance to the Sooners' explosive offense. He's registered five 100-yard performances during the regular season. Jamie Squire/Getty Images Georgia signal-caller Jake Fromm will pick and choose his spots after handing off several times to Nick Chubb and Sony Michel, who have a combined 2,123 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns apiece this season. In order to secure a win, the backfield duo must control the game flow to minimize Oklahoma's time of possession. At times, we've witnessed weaknesses within the Sooners front seven. Oklahoma State running back Justice Hill gashed this defense for 228 rushing yards. Without much of a passing attack, West Virginia ball-carriers Kennedy McKoy and Justin Crawford combined for 234 yards on the ground against Oklahoma. Kevin C.  Cox/Getty Images If Chubb and Michel find success early, Fromm will see the field open up as the game progresses, which will allow him to take shots to his receivers downfield. Mayfield will outplay Fromm on the big stage, but the Bulldogs ground attack should serve as the equalizer on offense. Georgia's defense ranks No. 4 in the country, but this program hasn't seen an offensive unit comparable to Oklahoma's group. The Bulldogs need takeaways to tilt the game in their favor. They're not going to force many three-and-outs without yielding scores through the air. Keep in mind Mayfield has only thrown five interceptions, which occurred in a streak of four games. He's yet to throw a pick since his outing with Oklahoma State. Oklahoma wins this contest pulling away in the fourth quarter with its aerial attack finding holes in Georgia's secondary. Chubb and Michel will experience early success but fade after the Sooners make second-half adjustments.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Brett Deering/Getty Images      The 2018 Rose Bowl between No. 3 Georgia and No. 2 Oklahoma has the potential to be one for the ages. This College Football Playoff semifinal may not have the look of a traditional Rose Bowl—it’s the first in 15 years that won’t feature a Pac-12 or Big Ten team—but fans likely won’t mind too much if the game lives up to the hype. This matchup may not have the rivalry factor or history between the participants that tonight’s rubber match between Clemson and Alabama boasts, but the on-field excitement in the Granddaddy Of Them All should be second-to-none. You can read more about the Sugar Bowl, the other College Football Playoff game tonight, by clicking here .  Oddsmakers are expecting a close contest, having opened betting with Georgia as the slightest of favorites at -1 before moving the line to UGA -3 ( update 4:30 p.m. ET: the line is now UGA -2) after early sharp action. It’s the smallest spread of the any of the New Year’s Six bowl games, but also has the second-largest total—61—of any of those major matchups. That game could easily play in the 30’s for both teams, with Vegas expecting a high-scoring, back-and-forth battle that may come down to the wire.

Participating in the oldest and most prestigious bowl game with the chance to play for a national title at stake makes this a truly special game, one that both sides will be going all out to try and win. It's an old fashioned offense versus defense showdown, with Georgia hoping that its top-tier D can shut down an unstoppable Oklahoma attack in the Rose Bowl.  The UGA defense has blossomed under second-year coach Kirby Smart. The former Alabama defensive coordinator has helped transform this program into a juggernaut on that side of the ball. Led by star linebacker Roquan Smith—a player many believe is the best overall defender in the entire country—the ‘Dawgs rank as the No. 4 defense in the nation, giving up an average of only 271 yards per game to opponents and letting just two—Auburn and Missouri—eclipse the 300-yard mark. This unit will face its toughest test yet in the Rose Bowl, as it is tasked with slowing down an offense that was second-to-none in 2017.  Not many expected Oklahoma to improve as much as it has following the unexpected departure of head coach Bob Stoops, but he left the program in great hands with former offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley. The 34-year-old has been a boon for the program, especially in terms of developing Baker Mayfield into a superstar and modernizing the offense. OU averaged 583.3 yards per game offensively and there were only three occasions in which the Sooners failed to reach the 500-yard mark this season. There was not a single game in whic they went below 460 yards either. This consistency is a large reason why OU produced a Heisman winner—Mayfield garnered 732 first-place votes, 657 more than runner-up Bryce Love—that has connected on 262-of-369 passes (71%) for 4,340 yards and 41 touchdowns against a mere five interceptions.

It's a complete clash of styles: the Sooners spread you out and have one of college football 's best scoring offenses, while the Bulldogs crush opponents with the ground game and run more than just about any other team on first down (80.5 percent). Not only that, but both offenses are built to exploit the other's weakness, so this should be a fun matchup. Both teams are led by first-time coaches, meaning either Lincoln Riley or Kirby Smart will be playing for a national championship next week, and both have the team to win it all, too. Viewing information Date: Monday, Jan. 1 | Time: 5 p.m. ET Location: Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, California TV: ESPN | Live stream:  Watch ESPN , Watch ESPN apps Storylines Oklahoma: Quarterback Baker Mayfield has been battling an illness this week . While that likely won't affect his status for the game, it is something to monitor. But given Mayfield's tendency to get up for big games, this could literally be his own "Flu Game" a la Michael Jordan. Mayfield can also further cement his legacy as one of college football's best quarterbacks -- he's already won the Heisman Trophy -- by at least getting to the national championship.    Georgia: Georgia has grown into one of the premier jobs in college football given the rise of blue-chip, in-state talent in recent years. However, this playoff appearance is still one of firsts for the Bulldogs. As the great Berry Tramel wrote , Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm could be the first true freshman quarterback to win a national championship since (of all people) former Oklahoma quarterback Jamelle Holieway did it in 1985. Smart is a second-year coach and has been the one good recent example of an SEC program successfully plucking the Nick Saban coaching tree. To have a shot to make history, though, it needs to get past the Sooners. Prediction The over/under for this game is now at 60, and the over still seems appealing given how well these two offenses work. That would seemingly play into Oklahoma's favor. And if there's one thing Mayfield has proved, it's that it is hard to bet against him. This one is setting up to be a classic.

Jaime Squire/Getty Images             Connor Riley    Posted 3 months ago                   The Georgia Bulldogs take on the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2018 Rose Bowl on Monday, Jan. 1. Below find betting odds, picks and predictions for the game.  Georgia enters the game with a 12-1 record and avenged its only loss by beating Auburn in the SEC Championship game. Oklahoma also went 12-1 and beat TCU in the Big 12 championship game.          Georgia-Oklahoma betting: Odds for the 2018 College Football Playoff  Line: Georgia is a 1.5-favorite over Oklahoma in the 2018 College Football Playoff.  Line/Spread: The over/under for the 2018 College Football Playoff game is 60.  Georgia-Oklahoma betting: Picks and Predictions for the 2018 College Football Playoff  The predictions come from the SECCountry.com breaking news team.  Connor Riley: Oklahoma will undoubtedly be the best offense Georgia has played this season. The Sooners have perhaps the best offensive player in college football in Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield. But Georgia is able to counter with Roquan Smith, who won the 2017 Butkus award given to the best linebacker. And Georgia has the best defense Oklahoma has seen all season.  But the real difference in the game will be when Georgia has the ball on offense. Georgia has rushed for at least 200 yards in all but two games this year, and that ability, coupled with Oklahoma’s middle of the pack rush defense, will allow the Bulldogs to keep Mayfield and the Sooner offense off the field.  Score: Georgia 35, Oklahoma 27          S penser Davis : There are several different individual matchups that could play a big role in this game, and Georgia has the edge in most of them. But when it comes to the quarterback, Oklahoma has an emphatic advantage with Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield. Georgia QB Jake Fromm has proven to be capable, but he’s a true freshman and hasn’t performed under the bright lights of a College Football Playoff like Mayfield has. Because of that intangibles advantage and historic offensive firepower, the Sooners have a great shot to emerge victorious in the Rose Bowl. And one more thing: Don’t discount the OU defense — Georgia’s run game is exactly the kind of offense Mike Stoops loves to scheme for. The Sooners could very well turn in their best defensive performance of the season against the Bulldogs.  Score: Oklahoma 35, Georgia 29   Brian Stultz: Georgia’s defense taking on Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield is the best matchup of either playoff games. The Bulldogs have made most offenses look bad this season, but the Sooners are on another level. The rushing duo of Nick Chubb and Sony Michel will put up points, but in the end, Oklahoma pulls out a classic victory to make the title game.   Corey Knapp: Oklahoma scoring first and then getting out to a two-touchdown lead will be a key for the Sooners, as Georgia has rarely had to play from multiple scores down at all this season, and when it did — first Auburn game — it wasn’t pretty. If the Bulldogs defense can withstand the surge — and there will be a surge or two — from Baker Mayfield and then begin to dictate the line of scrimmage, that will be the difference in the game. Same goes for the other side of the ball in terms of Georgia’s offensive line taking control and wearing down the Sooners defensive front. A close, moderately high-scoring game into the fourth quarter, when Georgia pulls away on the strength of its lines and running backs.   A ndrew Astleford: It all comes down to Baker Mayfield vs. Georgia’s defense, which is the best matchup of the College Football Playoff. Mayfield will make plays, and Oklahoma will score points. But stellar linebacker Roquan Smith and the rest of the Bulldogs’ defense will come up with enough stops to allow Georgia to earn a spot in the national championship game.

The red-hot Sooners will face their toughest test of the season Monday when they clash with the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs in the Rose Bowl .  Oklahoma is a 2.5-point underdog in Pasadena at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com, despite the Sooners opening as a small favorite. In their last seven games as an underdog, the Sooners are 6-1 SU and ATS.   Georgia Bulldogs vs. Oklahoma Sooners  When: Monday, Jan . 1, 5 p.m. ET  Where: Rose Bowl, Pasadena, Calif .  Betting Line / Total: Georgia -2 / 60 Points  Bulldogs vs. Sooners OddsShark Matchup Report   Oklahoma Sooners  Baker Mayfield's decision to return for his senior season at Oklahoma proved to be a wise one. The superstar gunslinger set career highs across the board with 4,340 passing yards and 41 passing touchdowns and only five interceptions en route to securing the Heisman Trophy.  Three of the top four scoring defenses in the nation make up the rest of the field in this year's College Football Playoff and will give Mayfield a chance to cement his legacy against some of the sport's very best units.  Since Oct. 1 of 2016, the Sooners have amassed a 22-1 SU and 15-8 ATS record, per the OddsShark College Football Database .   Georgia Bulldogs  Georgia averaged 34.9 points per game on offense this season and allowed only 13.2 points per game, giving the Bulldogs on average margin of 21.7 points per game.  The Bulldogs dominated most of the games on their schedule in going 12-1 SU and 9-4 ATS and had a chance to avenge their only loss in the SEC Championship Game with a 28-7 victory over Auburn. The betting favorite is 7-2 SU in the last nine Rose Bowl matchups, and Georgia is 9-3 SU in its last 12 games played in January.  Monday's total is set at 60 points. The UNDER is 7-1 in Oklahoma's last eight games against SEC opponents.  While this matchup is being touted for the exciting clash of an Oklahoma pass attack that ranks third in the nation vs. a Georgia pass defense that ranks second in the nation, that is only one element of an overall great game between two excellent teams. Regardless of which side of the offense vs. defense argument you land on, this has the makings of an instant classic that is decided on the last drive of the game.

This is as compelling as it gets because every team has a legitimate shot to win it all. With that in mind, allow me to lay out a few reasons why No. 2 Oklahoma will go on to beat Georgia and ultimately win the national championship. Some reasons are simple. For example, the Sooners had college football 's most outstanding player this season. Some require a little more digging. You'd be hard-pressed to find a positive thing to say about this defense. Still, Oklahoma -- led by first-year coach Lincoln Riley, the youngest in college football -- is in the show. The only thing separating it from a national title is two more games. Here's how the Sooners can make that happen. 1. The Sooners have this player ... you may have heard of him: His name rhymes with Maker Bayfield, and he was only the 2017 Heisman Trophy winner. You know, no big deal. Say what you will about Mayfield's on-field, ahem, "cockiness" and off-field "issues" (if you want to go so far as to call them that), the man has been at his best when the most is on the line. In his four biggest games this season (vs. Ohio State , Oklahoma State and TCU twice), Mayfield has 1,560 passing yards at 12.6 yards per attempt with a 15-2 TD-to-INT ratio. Keep in mind, too, that Ohio State and TCU are top-15 defenses, per Football Outsiders. Mayfield also leads PFF's quarterback passer rating with a score of 137.9 and ranks sixth with 29 "big-time throws." So while Georgia and potentially Alabama or Clemson would be the toughest defenses he's faced this season, the numbers say he's up to the task.    The case for ... No. 1 Clemson No. 3 Georgia No. 4 Alabama 2. Oklahoma has college football's best, most diverse offense: Now that you know everything about Mayfield's impact, it's time to tell you that the Sooners aren't a one-man show -- even if it feels like it sometimes. The Sooners have the top offense in every S&P+ category and are actually more efficient this year without the trio of Dede Westbrook , Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon. In particular, PFF loves this offense's skill players. Running back Rodney Anderson , who has been unstoppable in the second half of the season, ranks 14th in explosive run rate percentage. Receivers Jeff Badet, Mykel Jones and CeeDee Lamb rank in the top 15 nationally, respectively, in wide receiver rating* and in the top 10 in offensive success rating (i.e. the percentage of targets that go for a positive play). Additionally, Marquise Brown , the team's leading receiver with 981 yards, averages 20 yards per reception. That's fourth-best among receivers who have at least 40 catches on the season. Take a look at how PFF has them ranked among wideouts with 200+ snaps. Oklahoma WR Rec. Yds. TDs Pos. Rating (rank) Success Rate % (rank) Jeff Badet 27 400 3 150 (2) 59.4 (7) CeeDee Lamb 39 724 7 140.8 (4) 59.3 (8) Mykel Jones 16 310 1 135.4 (12) 65 (3) Marquise Brown 50 987 6 131.9 (20) 48.6 (75) Mark Andrews , the Mackey Award winner for top tight end, is a mismatch with 58 receptions, second-most among tight ends. The reason why Oklahoma's offense is so successful is because it has Mayfield distributing the ball to so many weapons that it's impossible to shut down every option. If you get into a shootout with this team, it's not likely that you're going to outscore them. 3. The defense isn't good, but it can be disruptive in spots: The old adage stands that "defense wins championships." That's a little misleading as it's actually the right kind of defense that wins championships. In Oklahoma's case, using speed to disrupt an offense's rhythm is what it does best. Otherwise, there's no way to spin it: OU's defense just isn't that good. Yes, playing potent Big 12 offenses has something to do with the raw numbers, but even when you adjust for efficiency there's not much to like. But here's what the Sooners do have: a mostly-veteran group capable of well-timed disruption. That's going to be particularly important against Georgia in the Rose Bowl semifinal because the key to beating the Bulldogs' offense is to get them out of their comfort zone and behind the chains. Sooners edge rusher Ogbonnia Okoronkwo ranks fourth overall by PFF and actually grades out better against the run than the pass. The defensive line as a whole is best in passing situations when it can tee off and get to the quarterback. At linebacker, Caleb Kelly is a bright young star who can fill gaps and win one-on-one in space. So while there's no way around the fact that Oklahoma will give up yards and have to win in higher scoring games, it is capable of making enough plays to give its offense a chance.

I kept going back-and-forth on this pick all week, but ultimately, I can't get Oklahoma's stomping of Ohio State and Georgia's blowout loss in its first meeting against Auburn off my mind. The Sooners took care of business against the best defense they played this season, while the Bulldogs needed a second matchup to adjust to the Tigers' offense. There are no second chances here, and the experienced Baker Mayfield will ultimately be too much for Georgia to handle over 60 minutes.              Mike Tierney  Top Dog      Mon 1/1  Mon 1/1            UNDER 61 UNDER 61   Georgia 54 vs Oklahoma 48 1/01  UGA 54 vs OKLA 48 1/01     LOSS      ROSE BOWL (Pasadena, Calif.) -- You might have heard that Oklahoma QB Blake Mayfield is fighting flu-like symptoms. A media appearance Saturday morning could not hide the effects of his illness. Heisman Trophy winners endure such challenges to play, and Mayfield will. Still I suspect first-year Sooners coach Lincoln Riley will ease his burden by summoning more running plays. So, don?t look for OU to go hog-wild offensively. Georgia, similarly, will lean more on upper-class RBs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel than on true freshman QB Jake Fromm, as solid as he?s been. The Okies have been Under in five of the past six bowls, albeit under departed coach Bob Stoops, and I anticipate more of the same in a razor-thin win for the Under.

He can. He just doesn't have to most of the time, thanks to the punishing Bulldog running game and a defense that's fast, physical and deep. That defense will force some mistakes from Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield, the Bulldog offense will put together long drives against an overmatched Sooner defense and Georgia will win by double digits.

Georgia, despite its one-dimensional approach, is very good at taking the air out of the ball and playing great defense The Bullodgs will force Mayfield to maximize his opportunities with the ball, which will lead to him pressing and making some mistakes.              Kenny White  Wizard of Odds      Tue 12/5  Tue 12/5            Oklahoma +1.5 OKLA +1.5   Georgia 54 vs Oklahoma 48 1/01  UGA 54 vs OKLA 48 1/01     LOSS      ROSE BOWL (Pasadena, Calif.) -- This is going to be a great game of contrasting styles. Georgia is going to try to pound the ball down OU's throat with a very strong running game, however, I prefer the balanced offense Oklahoma will throw at Georgia. I'm banking on the maestro, Baker Mayfield. QB is the most important position on the field and while Jake Fromm is really good, he's really young. Mayfield completed 71 percent of his passes for an amazing 11.76 yards per pass, with 41 touchdowns and just 5 interceptions. Those are stats that legends are made of. Mayfield has already seen Ohio State and TCU twice, so he will be well prepared for Georgia's stout defense. Oklahoma's defense is far better than the stats indicate. I give the Sooners the 18th-best defense in the nation. They score so many points and play in a high-scoring conference with Oklahoma State, Texas Tech and West Virginia. Take out the Oklahoma State game when the Sooners allowed 52 points and 661 yards -- and still won -- and the numbers look different. The Sooners will stack the box and force the young Fromm to beat them.
