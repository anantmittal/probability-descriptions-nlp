Are You at Risk of Having a Baby With Down Syndrome?  Doctors describe some of the known risk factors for having a child with Down syndrome. By Virginia Sole-Smith  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Leah Warkentin/Design Pics/Corbis  Although researchers have pinpointed how Down syndrome occurs, they still don't know very much about why it happens. This can make it difficult to understand whether you are at risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. "There have been theories about whether it's due to how well the mother metabolizes folate, but there are just as many studies saying no as studies saying yes," explains Kenneth Rosenbaum, M.D., founder of the division of genetics and metabolism and co-director of the Down Syndrome Clinic at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. "For the most part, we simply don't understand this as well as we would like," he says. Down syndrome is a condition that happens when a baby is conceived with a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. In about 3 percent to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome, there are two full 21st chromosomes and a partial extra chromosome 21 stuck to a different chromosome altogether, the result of a process called translocation. Down syndrome occurs all around the world, in people of every race and economic background. And although it is a genetic condition, you most likely will not have any family history. "In most cases, the extra chromosome seems to happen by chance," says Emily Jean Davidson, M.D., clinical director of the Down Syndrome Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Down syndrome can occur at any maternal age, but the possibility increases as a woman gets older. That said, if you have one child with Down syndrome, your chance of having a second child with the condition is about 1 percent for a mother over 40. If your baby has a translocation, physicians will suggest checking both parents' chromosomes to see if the translocation arose in the baby (most commonly the case) or if either parent is a carrier. If so, genetic testing can pinpoint the cause and determine your individual chance of recurrence. But there is one key risk factor for Down syndrome: maternal age. A 25-year-old woman has a 1 in 1,200 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome; by 35, the risk has increased to 1 in 350; by age 40, to 1 in 100; and by 49, it's 1 in 10, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. If you are over 35 and thinking about getting pregnant, you and your partner may want to undergo genetic counseling to more precisely pinpoint your risk. Regardless of your age, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that all pregnant women should be offered prenatal genetic screening for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. During weeks 11 to 14 of your pregnancy, a blood test combined with an ultrasound (which checks the thickness at the back of the fetus's neck, known as its nuchal translucency) can detect Down syndrome in 82 to 87 percent of cases, with minimal risk to you or your baby. If you are over 35 or have other known risk factors, your doctor may also suggest a fetal DNA test (sold commercially as MaterniT21 or Harmony) during the first trimester; it has a 99 percent accuracy rate because it works by sequencing the small pieces of your baby's DNA that circulates in your bloodstream during pregnancy. In your second trimester, another blood test, known as the multiple marker screening, or quad screening (because it checks the level of four different substances in your blood) can detect Down syndrome with 80 percent accuracy. If any of these screening tests raise a red flag, you can have a diagnostic test such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), though these procedures do carry a small risk of miscarriage. Deciding whether to be screened, and which tests to have, is a personal choice: "Some women feel that the more information they have, the better they can prepare themselves, or they may make some tough decisions," says Dr. Davidson, noting that diagnosing Down syndrome in utero does help doctors know to keep close tabs on whether your baby has any potentially life-threatening related issues, such as congenital heart disease. "But some families decline being screened because they feel the information wouldn't change the course of their pregnancy." Keep track of your medical records with this printable list of prenatal tests No matter what your risk, remember that Down syndrome occurs before conception: "Nothing you do during your pregnancy will increase your risk or reverse what has already happened," Dr. Rosenbaum says. "All you can do while pregnant is take the best possible care of yourself and your baby by eating well, taking prenatal vitamins, and following other common sense advice."

Read below for recent statistics on Down syndrome in the United States.  Occurrence of Down syndrome in the United States  Babies:   Down syndrome continues to be the most common chromosomal disorder. Each year, about 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome, which is about 1 in every 700 babies born. [ Read summary ]  Between 1979 and 2003, the number of babies born with Down syndrome increased by about 30%. [ Read summary ]  Older mothers are more likely to have a baby affected by Down syndrome than younger mothers. In other words, the prevalence of Down syndrome increases as the mother’s age increases. Prevalence is an estimate of how often a condition occurs among a certain group of people. To estimate the prevalence of Down syndrome, the number of pregnancies affected by Down syndrome is compared to the total number of live births. [ Read summary ]    Children and Adults:   In 2002, about 1 out of every 1,000 children and teenagers (0 to 19 years old) living in the United States had Down syndrome. This means that in 2002 about 83,000 children and teenagers were living with Down syndrome. [ Read summary ]  Researchers estimated that in 2008 about 1 out of every 1,200 people (children, teens, and adults) living in the United States had Down syndrome. This means that in 2008 about 250,700 children, teens, and adults were living with Down syndrome in the United States.[ Read summary ]   Down syndrome survival   The life expectancy of people with Down syndrome increased dramatically between 1960 and 2007. In 1960, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 10 years old. In 2007, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 47 years old. [ Read summary ]  Many factors can affect how long a person with Down syndrome lives.  Sometimes infants with Down syndrome are born weighing less than 1,500 grams, or about 3.3 pounds. This is called “very low birth weight.” These babies are 24 times more likely to die in the first 28 days of life compared to infants with Down syndrome of normal birth weight (between 2,500 grams and 4,000 grams, or between 5.5 and 8.8 pounds). [ Read summary ]  Black or African-American infants with Down syndrome have a lower chance of surviving beyond the first year of life compared with white infants with Down syndrome. More research is needed to help understand why. [ Read summary ]  Infants with Down syndrome who also had a congenital heart defect (CHD) were five times more likely to die in the first year of life compared to infants with Down syndrome who did not have a CHD. [ Read summary ]    Between 1983 and 2003, about 93% of babies born with Down syndrome survived to one year of age. In the same time period, about 88% of babies born with Down syndrome survived to 20 years of age. [ Read summary ]  The number of infants with Down syndrome that die before one year of age has declined over time. For example, between 1979 and 2003, among babies with Down syndrome, the rate of death during the first year of life declined from 8.5% to 5.0%, a decrease of about 41%. For comparison, the rate of death during the first year of life among all babies in the general population declined from 1.5% during 1979-1983 to 0.9% during 1999-2003, a decrease of about 40%. [ Read summary ]   Disabilities and added risks   About 50% of all babies born with Down syndrome are also born with a congenital heart defect . Babies with Down syndrome can be affected by a wide variety of heart defects. Many of these conditions will need surgery, while some milder heart defects might go away on their own as the child grows and may only need to be monitored by a healthcare provider. [ Read summary ]  Compared to children without Down syndrome, children with Down syndrome are at higher risk for:  Hearing loss (up to 75% may be affected)  Obstructive sleep apnea, a condition where a person’s breathing temporarily stops while asleep (between 50 -75%)  Ear infections (between 50 -70% may be affected)  Eye diseases, like cataracts (up to 60%)  Eye issues requiring glasses (50%)  Heart defects present at birth (50%)  Intestinal blockage at birth requiring surgery (12%)  Hip dislocation (when the thigh bone slips out of the hip socket) (6%)  Thyroid disease (a problem with metabolism) (4-18%)  Anemia (red blood cells can’t carry enough oxygen to the body) (3%)  Iron deficiency anemia (red blood cells don’t have enough iron to carry oxygen to the body) (10%)  Leukemia (1%) in infancy or early childhood  Hirschsprung disease (an illness of the gut that can cause constipation) (<1%)This article includes the American Academy of Pediatrics Health Supervision for children with Down syndrome from 2011. [ Read summary ]  For more health care information for families of children with Down syndrome    Older adults with Down syndrome have increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. [ Read summary ]   Health care, costs, and other related topics   Among children aged 0-4 years with private insurance, average medical care costs were 12 times higher for children with Down syndrome compared to children of the same age without Down syndrome. [ Read summary ]  For infants with Down syndrome, those born with a heart defect had, on average, health care costs that were five times higher in the first year of life than for infants with Down syndrome who did not have a heart defect. [ Read summary ]  A study used data from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Healthcare Needs (NSCSHN) to look at the effects of Down syndrome on families. Responses from the NSCSHN questionnaire indicated the following:  Nearly 60% of families of children with Down syndrome provided health care at home. Health care included practices such as changing bandages, care of feeding or breathing equipment, and giving medication and therapies.  Over 40% of families of children with Down syndrome had a family member who stopped working because of the child’s condition.  About 40% reported the child’s condition caused financial problems.

Author information 1 Interfaith Medical Center, Division of Cytogenetics, Brooklyn, New York 11238. Abstract In a sample of 75 children with trisomy for chromosome 21, or Down syndrome, there were 42 males and 33 females. The sex ratio was 1.30 which is statistically not significant (p greater than 0.05). However, a similar sex ratio (1.36) was reported in a larger sample size which was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). This discrepancy was due to the size of the samples. The two studies suggested an excess of males in the referred population. The decreasing age of mothers of infants with Down syndrome was also evident. Furthermore, more, more males with Down syndrome were born to young couples (age less than 35 years) while elderly couples had an excess of girls.

Are You at Risk of Having a Baby With Down Syndrome?  Doctors describe some of the known risk factors for having a child with Down syndrome. By Virginia Sole-Smith  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Leah Warkentin/Design Pics/Corbis  Although researchers have pinpointed how Down syndrome occurs, they still don't know very much about why it happens. This can make it difficult to understand whether you are at risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. "There have been theories about whether it's due to how well the mother metabolizes folate, but there are just as many studies saying no as studies saying yes," explains Kenneth Rosenbaum, M.D., founder of the division of genetics and metabolism and co-director of the Down Syndrome Clinic at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. "For the most part, we simply don't understand this as well as we would like," he says. Down syndrome is a condition that happens when a baby is conceived with a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. In about 3 percent to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome, there are two full 21st chromosomes and a partial extra chromosome 21 stuck to a different chromosome altogether, the result of a process called translocation. Down syndrome occurs all around the world, in people of every race and economic background. And although it is a genetic condition, you most likely will not have any family history. "In most cases, the extra chromosome seems to happen by chance," says Emily Jean Davidson, M.D., clinical director of the Down Syndrome Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Down syndrome can occur at any maternal age, but the possibility increases as a woman gets older. That said, if you have one child with Down syndrome, your chance of having a second child with the condition is about 1 percent for a mother over 40. If your baby has a translocation, physicians will suggest checking both parents' chromosomes to see if the translocation arose in the baby (most commonly the case) or if either parent is a carrier. If so, genetic testing can pinpoint the cause and determine your individual chance of recurrence. But there is one key risk factor for Down syndrome: maternal age. A 25-year-old woman has a 1 in 1,200 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome; by 35, the risk has increased to 1 in 350; by age 40, to 1 in 100; and by 49, it's 1 in 10, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. If you are over 35 and thinking about getting pregnant, you and your partner may want to undergo genetic counseling to more precisely pinpoint your risk. Regardless of your age, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that all pregnant women should be offered prenatal genetic screening for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. During weeks 11 to 14 of your pregnancy, a blood test combined with an ultrasound (which checks the thickness at the back of the fetus's neck, known as its nuchal translucency) can detect Down syndrome in 82 to 87 percent of cases, with minimal risk to you or your baby. If you are over 35 or have other known risk factors, your doctor may also suggest a fetal DNA test (sold commercially as MaterniT21 or Harmony) during the first trimester; it has a 99 percent accuracy rate because it works by sequencing the small pieces of your baby's DNA that circulates in your bloodstream during pregnancy. In your second trimester, another blood test, known as the multiple marker screening, or quad screening (because it checks the level of four different substances in your blood) can detect Down syndrome with 80 percent accuracy. If any of these screening tests raise a red flag, you can have a diagnostic test such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), though these procedures do carry a small risk of miscarriage. Deciding whether to be screened, and which tests to have, is a personal choice: "Some women feel that the more information they have, the better they can prepare themselves, or they may make some tough decisions," says Dr. Davidson, noting that diagnosing Down syndrome in utero does help doctors know to keep close tabs on whether your baby has any potentially life-threatening related issues, such as congenital heart disease. "But some families decline being screened because they feel the information wouldn't change the course of their pregnancy." Keep track of your medical records with this printable list of prenatal tests No matter what your risk, remember that Down syndrome occurs before conception: "Nothing you do during your pregnancy will increase your risk or reverse what has already happened," Dr. Rosenbaum says. "All you can do while pregnant is take the best possible care of yourself and your baby by eating well, taking prenatal vitamins, and following other common sense advice."

Mark Leach  May 2, 2013  What are the odds that you are having a child with Down syndrome?  Here in my hometown, it’s Derby week. With the greatest two minutes in sports upon us, it naturally has me thinking about odds. Indeed, prenatal testing for Down syndrome has that same focus. So, what are the odds that you are having a child with Down syndrome? Not only is this answer important, but it will surprise many.  It has long been known that the chance for having a child with Down syndrome increases with the age of the mother. See the graph at this post for the chance based on maternal age. While this relationship has been known, the reason for it remains unknown. Moreover, the most recent guidelines from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD) state that maternal age, alone, is not enough to rely upon for the chance of having a child with Down syndrome.  This is where prenatal screening comes in. Screening tests provide a reevaluation of the odds that a pregnancy is positive for Down syndrome. Initially these tests could only be provided in the second-trimester. Then, in 2007, professional guidelines recognized the nuchal translucency-combined test, which can be offered in the first trimester.  As an example of these type of screening tests, a mother who is 25-years old has a baseline chance of having a child with Down syndrome of about 1-in-1,250; if she were to receive a screen result for Down syndrome, then her odds may be readjusted to 1-in-250, or some other revision of her baseline chance for having a child with Down syndrome. But, these tests have been likened to “ tarot cards ” because they are imprecise, with false positives outweighing the number of pregnancies with Down syndrome that the screening tests actually detect.  As has been covered at length on this blog, now we have a new era of prenatal testing known as Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS). These tests essentially turn the odds of the previous screening tests on their head. Whereas under the “tarot cards” false positives outnumber true positives, that is not the case for NIPS; instead, a NIPS result for Down syndrome can mean the odds are that the pregnancy actually is positive for Down syndrome (when the mother is 30 years or older–see the graph at this post ).  But, as every professional statement and even the NIPS testing companies themselves have emphasized , a NIPS result is not enough to rely upon because there remain false positives and false negatives. Therefore, diagnostic testing is required to truly know whether you are having a child with Down syndrome and only an amniocentesis provides the most accurate results, since CVS testing can return the same false positive as NIPS.  But (and here’s the kicker), even a diagnostic test will not tell you your odds for having a child with Down syndrome.  Here’s why:  Odds are, you are not going to have a child with Down syndrome. There is no maternal age where the odds of having a child with Down syndrome exceed the chance of not having a child with Down syndrome. In fact, almost every pregnant woman in the world is not going to have a child with Down syndrome.  This is because the incidence of actually having a child with Down syndrome is very low. Of the 6 million pregnancies each year in the United States, there are at most 20,000 pregnancies that are actually carrying a child with Down syndrome. But, even for those pregnancies the odds are they are not going to have a child with Down syndrome .  How can this be?  Because most pregnancies positive for Down syndrome naturally miscarry. Reports vary on the percentages, but the ones that I’m familiar with state that 50% of pregnancies carrying a child with Down syndrome miscarry in the first trimester and 40% of those pregnancies that make it to the second trimester miscarry. This means, receiving a CVS result in the first trimester means the pregnancy has as much of a chance of miscarrying as continuing into the second trimester. Once the pregnancy is into the second trimester, when an amniocentesis can be performed, the odds of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome are still 6 out of 10.  So, the odds are that even with a diagnosis for Down syndrome, it does not mean that a child will be born with Down syndrome.  I wonder how often this actually is shared with expectant mothers considering prenatal testing. While it is discussed in recognized resources like “ Diagnosis to Delivery ,” for those mothers who choose to continue their pregnancy after a prenatal diagnosis, I wonder if it is shared with mothers considering termination?  It certainly would seem relevant that a woman considering an invasive medical procedure would be advised of the possible outcomes if the procedure were not performed. Considering that the whole exercise of prenatal testing is to determine the chance of having a child with Down syndrome, shouldn’t these odds also be shared?  Like this: Like  Loading...

We are 20 weeks into our pregnancy and just found out from the materniT21 test that our child has DS T21.  So I’m out hunting for information and found your blog referenced by a genetic technician. In the above you state, “Once the pregnancy is into the second trimester, when an amniocentesis can be performed, the odds of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome are still 6 out of 10.” As we are in our 2nd trimester this is obviously very troubling and I want to understand what we are facing as we continue to carry.  So I thank you for your efforts and ask if you can point me to the source of the metrics you pointed to above?         Mark Leach  says:    July 24, 2014 at 12:21 pm     Abraham–a MaterniT21 test is never positive or negative completely for Down syndrome–there remain false positives and false negatives. To determine your wife’s chances of having a child with Down syndrome following a MaterniT21 test, it would involve applying her baseline chance based on her age with the stated accuracy rate for MaterniT21 (around 99.5% detertion/99.9% specificity). You can follow the analysis at this post or ask to meet with a genetic counselor who should be able to advise you.         rebekaH  says:    August 18, 2015 at 3:38 pm     my daughter tested positive for down syndrome im extremely happy that she had no such thing at birth at all shes smart and going in fifth grade now I almost got a abortion trusting results but felt so bad because I was far along so thank you jesus for this blessing oh I prayed hard I EVEN had a second child 14 monthes later and now 10 yrs later im pregnant again this time worried im 42,         Mark Leach  says:    August 18, 2015 at 4:32 pm     Rebekah, when you say your daughter tested “positive” for Down syndrome, I wonder if that was just a screening test. Given your current pregnancy, it is important to know that the only true “positive” is from diagnostic testing, which involves inserting a needle into the womb and removing a sample of the amniotic fluid. Unless you have that test (or a few other similarly invasive diagnostic tests), no other test is truly a “positive,” but just a recalculation of the chances of having a child with Down syndrome.           Deb  says:    March 15, 2016 at 1:09 pm     How are you doing now….w ith your downs baby?…We..have a two day old baby         Paula Jane Pieklo-Byler  says:    April 13, 2017 at 2:20 pm     My son has,downs. He is 32 on May 1. I was only 21 when I had him which back then was rare. I got him into infant stimulation classes at 2,months. I worked with him every day. Teachers said he could not learn to read but I taught him phonics and he can read anything! It is very important that you work with your child alot.  The school taught him signing but then he stopped talking. I did homemade flashcards to get him to talk. I labelled everything in the house to teach him to read, I got him fun reading programs for the computer. Now he cooks, is a good cook, and he can walk to the store on his own, get everything on my lidt, and use a debit card and type in the pin. He went to normal preschool through high school. He went to a career center that taught him to cook and do laundry, dishes etc.  We taught him the days of the week by singing the happy days theme song! Over and over and over. I have a daughter born 4 years after him that is exceptionally smart. Craig can do just about anything!             Keshet  says:    October 1, 2014 at 3:26 pm     I have tested positive for Down’s syndrome and have to further go on to have amniocentesis . I would like to know where you got your information as I believe you are severely misinformed. There are a lot of women diagnosed with carrying a child with Down’s syndrome . Unfortunately- these tests are alot more indicative of actual results rather than not. I think you need to be doing more research prior to writing about something you are not entirely educated in.         Mark Leach  says:    October 1, 2014 at 4:17 pm     Please see the further research I have done on this issue at the post at this link . Read to the end and read the two other posts linked there. Also, feel free to share your amnio results as I would be curious if they confirm the screening test result or contradict the screen result.         Rachel  says:    May 10, 2016 at 12:33 am     I had a screening done when I was 22 years old, pregnant with first child, and they said I tested positive, had the amino, and my daughter is perfectly healthy. Even the doctors say the screening is not accurate.             Anonymous Person  says:    November 16, 2014 at 9:41 pm     Having made the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy that was confirmed T21 after NT screen and subsequent amniocentesis, I completely disagree with the approach you seem to be taking.  I was informed of the percentages of miscarriage, etc. prior to the amniocentesis, and this information in fact, lead us to make the decision my husband and I came to.  With a 40% chance of miscarriage, and grave reservations regarding other co-morbid conditions associated with a downs diagnosis, it is imperative to arm women with this information.  For your comment regarding the Maternit21 test above, I believe its cruel of you to convey such a tone of hopefulness.  This test is incredibly accurate, and an positive result is a devastating blow to the expecting couple.  While you are correct it is not foolproof 100%, I’d urge you to consider your tone in speaking to couples facing what is truly a traumatic experience – the possibility of carrying a child that will die or face potentially overwhelming health issues through his or her life.  The tone of your article is quite insensitive — Especially for those 20,000 pregnancies each year facing these issues.  Who else  exactly do you think is searching for your article????         Mark Leach  says:    November 17, 2014 at 9:37 am     Thank you for sharing your experience. I try to be mindful that every woman makes her own decision. I just want those decisions, whatever they may be, are based on accurate information. Too often that does not happen.         lesley  says:    January 28, 2016 at 10:47 am     I am a parent of an amazing girl with down syndrome,i didnt have any tests i took it as she was a baby and my baby! I wouldnt change her for the world! I think to many people are scared of the unknown and assume down syndrome is this condition that means the child will not reach and milestones or achieve anything?? There is nothing to say you will give birth to a baby that goes on to have any number of life dibilitating problems none of which are chromosome related so i think some of the mums posted on here are giving out bad attitudes to other mums about testing and DS.  Please look at all the facts and check with other mums in your areas whi have down syndrome children just what life can be like, yes yiu might visit hospital a few more times yes it takes longer for them to learn but in a away you get to keep your baby for longer before they become terrible toddlers with tantrums. babies are born healthy in lots of different ways my girl is healthy she just has down syndrome it doesnt difine her shes just a girl x         Fawn  says:    September 13, 2016 at 1:46 pm     What a beautiful statement Lesley!  Yes, some babies are born with challenges, like with my last baby.  He was in the NICU for 3 months with many complications.  The doctors said we could “pull the plug” if we wanted to.  We said NO WAY!  Now he’s 3, and has lived a year longer than they expected and functioning in ways they said he never would!  Yes, he has limits, takes longer to learn a few things, but knowing his disability, he’s brilliant, and I wouldn’t change a single minute of our experiences with this truly amazing, sweet, wonderful little boy!  I appreciate Mark’s article, giving hope is something much more rare these days!  I think it’s wonderful that his research and the time he has taken to share his experience can bless the lives, and give a measure of peace and hope to families expecting a new arrival!           Paula Jane Pieklo-Byler  says:    April 13, 2017 at 2:29 pm     My son was born with downs 32 years ago. Tests can be inaccurate as other have said on here. Some had a down a diagnosis and had a normal child. My son has downs but is perfectly healthy. He is like any other child. Went to normal school graduates. What they tell you about downs babies is not true! My son walks to the store on his own, gets what’s on my list, pays with debit card, remembers the pin! He cooks for me every day. It only takes patience to teach them! He is such a blessing .           ANONYMOUS  says:    February 1, 2015 at 2:42 am     Just a short blup… I too was recently dx with a child having Down’s Syndrome (DS).  My Maternit21 test came back with a high positive percentage and my amniocentesis came back positive as well.  I know these tests are not 100%, but it allows the parents to make important decisions.  Medical professionals never gave me information about a DS child miscarrying in the 2nd trimester secondary to DS.  Therefore, the incidents of a pregnancy and DS should be assessed on a case to case basis.  NOTE:  Not all DS children are dx in utero, the screenings and ultrasounds can come back negative for abnormalities as well.  Again, each pregnancy is different.         Mark Leach  says:    February 1, 2015 at 12:17 pm     Thank you for sharing your experience. You are correct that each pregnancy is unique and should be treated that way. With having a prenatal diagnosis, feel free to review the resources at the Prenatal Resources tab, which are recommended by professional guidelines, particularly if they weren’t provided to you. I hope you find them helpful.           kimberly  says:    July 21, 2015 at 6:55 am     I just foind out I am expecting ny fourth child and I am scared because my youngest has down syndrome and i love him dearly….im reading so much on here i dont get whether or not i will this child will be born with ds or not i am hoping for the best outcome and i believe i wouldnt be given anything i couldnt handle but theres so many thoughts running through my head… i will love the baby anyways In just so full of emotions and hopes that all is going to go well and i am 35 years old is this wrong of me?         Mark Leach  says:    July 21, 2015 at 2:02 pm     Kimberly: being a parent myself who had a child after our child with Down syndrome, I understand your concern. The rule of thumb is that once you’ve had a child with Down syndrome, your odds for having another child with Down syndrome are roughly 1:100. However, since you had your first child when you were under 35, according to the National Society of Genetic Counselors guidelines (see Table 1) on giving a diagnosis, your odds now are roughly 1:350. I would discuss these concerns further with your medical professional or genetic counselor, and if you’re connected with your local parent support organization, I expect they have staff members or volunteers who could also help you as well. I wish you a healthy and happy pregnancy.           Brona  says:    July 22, 2015 at 1:33 am     Hi, I was given a penta screen and it came back as 1 in 82 for having a child with Down syndrome. This is still only 1% chance right? I’m 25 and this is my second child, first was born healthy. I’m terrified and have elected to have an amniocentesis. Since this is not the materniti21 screening is it likely this is a false positive? I have been researching everything to do with this screening and it doesn’t seem scientifically accurate. It tests these substances in your blood but other things could effect these substances right; either lowering them or raising them.         Mark Leach  says:    July 22, 2015 at 8:40 am     Brona–you are correct. Penta is of the more traditional-style screening tests, which have higher false positives than cell free DNA tests like MaterniT21. With the Penta screen result, you would now be considered “high risk” and eligible for a covered cell free DNA test if in the United States. Many mothers with a high risk traditional screen result are opting to rely on the cell free DNA test result, particularly where it is screen-negative, to avoid the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis. However, if you wish to know for certain, an amnio will provide you that level of certainty. The Prenatal Resources tab has links for the recommended resources about Down syndrome for expectant mothers if you wish to learn more about the condition. I hope you receive the care and support you deserve from your medical team.         Nancy Duran  says:    March 7, 2018 at 2:27 pm     Hello My daughter’s test came back 1-65 chance of a Downs baby she is 21 what is your experience with this test?. They want her to get the harmony test witch they said would be more accurate         Mark Leach  says:    March 7, 2018 at 7:19 pm     Based on the odds you report, your daughter as a 1.5% chance that her test result is a true positive and a 98.5% chance that it is a false positive. Tests like Harmony are recognized as more accurate for Down syndrome than conventional screening and the Harmony result would trump a conventional screen result.               SR  says:    August 18, 2015 at 8:54 pm     Hi Mark – As a genetic counselor, I do inform patients that some babies with Down syndrome do pass away during the pregnancy.  Typically there is a ~30% risk of an IUFD after a diagnosis is made by amniocentesis around 16 weeks.  We therefore follow pregnancies with Down syndrome more closely with extra ultrasounds and monitoring in the 3rd trimester.  We unfortunately cannot predict which pregnancies will result in a demise and which will result in a live birth.  But having testing and diagnosing Down syndrome during the pregnancy can help parents be aware that there is an increased risk for a loss.  It also may help providers prevent a loss – if there are concerns about the baby’s growth, for example, then the doctor can induce labor, assuming she’s far enough along.  Do you think that people will be less likely to have testing if they know there’s an increased risk of an IUFD if the baby does have Down syndrome?         Mark Leach  says:    August 19, 2015 at 3:59 pm     I’m not sure whether they would be less likely to have testing if they knew beforehand of the increased chance of natural miscarriage. I do wonder, though, if moms may consider that their pregnancy may naturally miscarry after a diagnosis when considering whether they should terminate the pregnancy, i.e. choose to “let nature’s take its course” rather than intervene with an abortion.         Tarns  says:    September 24, 2015 at 10:54 pm     Hi. I am reading this after just finding out today that we have an increased risk of having a baby with downs syndrone. We have been offered an amnio test and are currently weighing up our options. This is baby number 4 for me and I am 37. My two eldest are already adults and i have a one year old. I have always been pro-choice and have thought previously if I found myself in this position that I would consider a termination. Now I am not sure if I could. I found the information you have provided very informative, and it does make me lean towards just waiting to see what happens. So I think your response to the Dr is valid. It may definitely lead more people to bypass a termination and choose to let nature take its course.         Mark Leach  says:    September 25, 2015 at 8:11 am     Thank you. And if you’d like to learn more about living a life with Down syndrome and the supports available to individuals and their families, check out the Prenatal Resources tab .               Omar  says:    September 14, 2015 at 7:30 am     My wife just delivered our first child who’s diagnosed with ds upon birth. My wife is only 26 and this is our first child, does this indicate particularly high odds for having a second child with DS? Are there any tests that we have to take prior to considering another pregnancy? Thanks alot         Mark Leach  says:    September 14, 2015 at 12:22 pm     Omar: your child should have a karyotype to determine whether your child has nondisjunction Down syndrome or translocation Down syndrome. Then, depending on what type of Down syndrome, check either Table 1 or Table 2 of the NSGC guidelines on delivering a Down syndrome diagnosis, available at this sheets nsgc . I would consult with a genetic counselor about any questions you may have.  The NSGC guidelines also have helpful recommended resources for new parents. I would also recommend as a new parent the American Academy of Pediatrics healthcare Bull AAP , which you can provide to your pediatrician if he or she isn’t familiar with them. Referral to local support organizations is another recommended resource and I hope you were provided your local group’s contact information.           Eghbali  says:    November 8, 2015 at 8:07 pm     Hi. My husband has two children from his ex-wife. The older one is healthy and the younger one has down syndrom. I’m now35 years old and would like to know how high is the percentage of a second child with down syndrom? Thank you in advance for your help.         Mark Leach  says:    November 8, 2015 at 10:15 pm     That’s hard to say as the chance for Down syndrome has been researched based on the mother’s age, but there are few studies based on the father’s. Of the few I’m aware of, there is only a statistical correlation once the father is over 40. I would ask a genetic counselor, but I expect the answer will be that it is your age that is more relevant than your husband having a child with Down syndrome.           Jen  says:    November 28, 2015 at 4:19 pm     Hi Mark, Your website is extremely informative and I’m glad I found it. I’m very confused about the results from my second trimester quad screening and perhaps you can help simplify all the numbers I’ve read on the internet but can’t seem to make sense of. Not sure if this is relevant to the question I’m asking but my NT scan and first trimester screening were “normal.” Anyway, so I’ve read online that the non invasive screening tests identify 80% of women carrying babies with Trisomy 21 and yield a 5% false positive. I had a positive screening of 1:85 risk of Trisomy 21. My doctor explained that I have a little over 1% risk but what does that mean in real terms if the test finds 80% of cases? If I turn out to be one of the 84/85 does that mean I was a false positive? This is what confuses me. If 80% of cases are positively screened what does that mean for someone like me with who’s a higher risk than someone else my age (32). And 80% is such a high proportion whereas 1% seems so low. I can’t seem to reconcile the two in my mind. Sorry if this is a ramble. Thanks so much!         Mark Leach  says:    November 29, 2015 at 3:42 pm     No apology necessary, Jen–you’re experiencing the common confusion with screening tests, which, frankly, the cell free DNA screening labs (cfDNA AKA NIPT) rely on in hyping their claimed accuracy. But you are actually understanding your results correctly. The claimed “accuracy” of cfDNA screens is 99+% for both its ability to detect those pregnancies actually carrying a child with Down syndrome and those pregnancies not carrying a child with Down syndrome (I’m not sure where you’re getting your 80%/5% statistics for cfDNA; I have seen that for other types of screening, but not cfDNA, so I’ll use the 99+% quoted by the labs). Here’s how the screen works in a tested population. At your age, you have somewhere around a 1-in-500 chance of having a child with Down syndrome, based just on your age. Given that your NT scan did not increase that chance, then your baseline remains the same (or more accurately is probably even lower, since the NT did not detect the chance of Down syndrome). So out of 50,000 32 year-old pregnant moms, 100 of them will actually be carrying a child with Down syndrome and 49,900 will not. At the claimed 99+% detection rate, that means the test will result a “positive” for 99 of the 100 moms actually carrying a child with Down syndrome and will report a “negative” for 49,940 of the moms not carrying a child with Down syndrome. But that means 50 of the moms not carrying a child with Down syndrome will receive a “positive” screen result just as the 99 of the moms actually carrying a child with Down syndrome. But for the particular mom, there’s no way of telling whether she is one of the 99 “true positives” or one of the 50 “false positives.” As a result, for every one of the 32 year-old pregnant moms who receive a “positive” screen result, they have a 66% chance of it being a “true positive” and a 34% chance of it being a “false positive.” In your case, you were given a 1-in-85 chance based on your screen result. So, as you correctly state, you could either be the one whose screen result is a “true positive” or you could be one of the 84 “false positives.” I hope this helps and whether it does or not, I would recommend you consult with a genetic counselor or medical geneticist to more fully explain your test results.           Johanna  says:    January 5, 2016 at 1:54 pm     Hi Iam 21 weeks pregnant. My blood results from prenatal screening said there a possibility I can have my baby with DS. She said there is a 30% chance. I’m going to have another ultrasound to see what’s really going on. Iam 23 years old. My 3year old came out perfectly fine. No problems. I’m worried. I don’t know what to think.         Mark Leach  says:    January 5, 2016 at 2:52 pm     Johanna–it depends on what type of prenatal screening you had. If it was the quad screen, your chance of a false positive still outweighs your chance of having a true positive screen result. That applies as well for if you had the newer cell free DNA-type screen like MaterniT21, Harmony, or one of those. The only way to know for certain is to have an amnio or wait until delivery.         KERI  says:    February 26, 2016 at 3:02 am     Hi Mark, I am currently 36 but conceived at 35. I am now 26 weeks. I had 2 soft markers on my ultrasound fetal pyelectasis and EIF. These markers which I was told are also found in healthy ‘normal’ babies can resolve in the 3rd trimester but it sparked them to have me take the materniti21 test which came back positive. Everything else is fine as far as growth. We had a fetal echo which looked great. I never had the NT test bc I was too far along and they couldn’t do it but I was curious what my odds are? They told me I have an 80% chance that she has Down syndrome.  I just don’t understand where that 80% is coming from. Is it all the risks combined or is it from the blood test? We are not going to do an amniocentesis. It doesn’t matter to us if she does have downs but of course it’s not what we had pictured for our lives. I have a completely healthy 10 month oLd right now. It’s all just so hard to swallow. Please help?         Mark Leach  says:    February 26, 2016 at 10:51 am     It sounds as though your providers are basing the 80% chance on what your positive predictive value would be based on your age. You can use this calculator at this link to see for yourself. A mom who conceived at 35 who receives a screen-positive cell free DNA screen (like MaterniT21) has an 80% chance that the result is a “true positive” and a 20% chance that it is a “false positive.” For more on PPV, see this fact sheet . All major medical organizations recommend that patients receive written information about the tested-for condition when receiving a screen positive cfDNA screen result, with the Lettercase booklet being identified as the resource to be provided. Your provider can order a copy for free, you can view the booklet on-line, or (best case) your provider orders several to have in stock for other patients. All of that can be done at the Lettercase website . Because you express an intention to continue your pregnancy, then there is another resource recognized for those moms who decide to continue. Diagnosis to Delivery is a book written by moms for moms and deals with the specific issues that surround having a prenatal result. While your test result remains a “maybe,” i.e. there remains a chance that your child does not have Down syndrome, you may still find the book helpful as you consider the chance of having a child with Down syndrome. The book is available for free as a .pdf or you can order a hardcopy from the Down Syndrome Pregnancy website . Lastly, local Down syndrome support organizations are another resource that both professional medical organizations recognize as being helpful for expectant parents and that expectant parents report finding as a source of support. You can find your local organization via this website . I hope this offering of resources is taken for what it is, to be helpful, and not to further overwhelm you. I wish you a healthy pregnancy and birth of your child.         Sarah  says:    November 1, 2016 at 5:17 pm     Hi Mark, I was wondering if you could comment more on the role of soft markers in the diagnosis of Downs. There appear to be so many babies born without chromosomal defects despite the presence of multiple markers on their ultrasounds, yet practitioners are still required to mention that there is a connection. My fetus has two markers (EIF & a mildly dilated kidney), and I received a “low risk” from the Harmony test, but I can’t get the idea of DS out of my head. I’m 36 weeks along and finding myself frightened and distracted solely because of these findings; wishing I hadn’t heard that they had any connection to chromosomal issues in the first place. I know the odds are well on my side, but I just can’t seem to find solace in the unknown. The harmony test accurately determined his gender – does that mean there’s a likelihood that it accurately assessed his risk for DS as well? Thanks.         Mark Leach  says:    November 2, 2016 at 10:16 am     Per the most recent guidelines , ultrasound findings of “soft markers” are to be followed up with serum screening, if that had not yet been offered. In your case, you’ve already had serum screening via the Harmony test, which is screen negative. While there remains the chance of a false negative, the Harmony result is more reliable than the ultrasound findings.                 manuel Gonzalez  says:    March 8, 2016 at 1:56 pm     my wife and i are having our 3rd baby we have a 6 year old girl and a 3 year old boy, our son was born with DS our first my daughter is normal but we just got word that our soon to be born has a 1 in 29 chance of been born with DS and my wife is devastated she really broke down when she got the blood results now our son was a 1 in 3 chance this one is different we are both 34 years old. she is 4 and a half months and this was only the blood test that she got back we still have not done the ” ambio” i apologize if miss spell the name, my wife does not want to do that test she did it the first time and she hates it.  Please tell me what are the odds of having another child with DS. thank you         Mark Leach  says:    March 8, 2016 at 2:15 pm     The rule of thumb after having a pregnancy positive for Down syndrome is that your baseline chances in subsequent pregnancies are 1-in-100. Without knowing what type of blood test you were given, I cannot confidently say what your adjusted chances are. I would ask your provider if the 1-in-3 chance you were quoted is the “positive predictive value.” If your provider is not aware of that term, he or she can learn more at this link . Here is an on-line calculator that may also be helpful in determining your chances.           Amanda Shine  says:    March 15, 2016 at 9:48 am     My harmony nipt produced a result of 95% risk T21. This is slightly less then typical +ve results. I am 12 weeks gestation and awaiting my cvs results. I have been advised by my doctor to wait for the karyotype before making decisions/ taking action. Why were my harmony results less conclusive then typical? Are you able to advise. We are facing agonising uncertainty.         Mark Leach  says:    March 15, 2016 at 4:55 pm     I think you have overestimated the accuracy of tests like Harmony. They are almost never 99% accurate and your chances based on a screen positive is relative to your age, with the lower the age, the lower the actual chance, e.g. a 30 year old mom getting a screen-positive Harmony result still would only have a 50% chance of having a child with Down syndrome. These tests are just screening tests and are never truly positive or negative. The only way to know about that is through diagnostic testing. To find out your actual chances based on your age and more about these tests, see this post and links in it.           Lisa  says:    March 17, 2016 at 11:15 pm     I’m in my 3rd trimester now an my doctor did a test screening,told me my child was at low risk of having Down syndrome. So dose that mean my baby will have Down syndrome?         Lisa  says:    March 17, 2016 at 11:19 pm     An I’m at the age of 23         Mark Leach  says:    March 18, 2016 at 10:35 am     That means the odds that your child will have Down syndrome are low, i.e. unlikely. What those odds are depend on your age and what screening test was done. Given that you are 23 and you have a screening test which your doctor is interpreting as low risk, then that would suggest you have a very low chance that your baby has Down syndrome–lower than just your already low likelihood given your relative young age.           Elyse Avelar  says:    March 29, 2016 at 5:53 pm     I recently went through my NT scan (blood work and Ultrasound) to check for abnormalities and Down Syndrome. I am only 26 and have no family history of it- nor does my husband… i got a call the following day… I tested POSITIVE for down syndrome. …. my heart sank. I dont really know what else she told me- but i do recall having to ask what my chances where. thats when she said ” 1 in 59″… anyway- i made an appointment to see the Genetics Counselor to go more in depth with my results. She told us that there is a 98% chance the baby is completely fine- and only 2% (2/100) chance the baby has DS. They suggest a few additional tests to check including the amnio and some type of cervix scrap- also to get the babys actual DNA. I said heck no…. however, I did go for another blood test that is to specifically check the babys chromosomes for the extra one that causes DS… (InformaSeq) I know the Genetics Counsleor said we should be fine- but I still cant help but question all of it. My babys neck fluid was good, 1.2- as far as the blood test, she said they test two proteins and i was low on one of them. (.17) and the other I was exactly where i should be. Could you give me any more feed back, clarity or additional advice. should I be worried? I am waiting for the results of the informaSeq and I am terrified. This is our first child.         Mark Leach  says:    March 30, 2016 at 10:08 am     I’m surprised to hear them state the likelihood of Down syndrome even at 2/100 given your relative young age and that it is based only on a NT-combined screen. Nevertheless, InformaSeq is a more accurate screen, but it does not test the baby’s chromosomes as covered at this post . Ultimately, the only way to know for certain is with an amnio, however, should your InformaSeq come back negative, many women are choosing to rely on the relatively low chance of a false negative instead of taking on the risk of miscarriage associated with an amnio. Should your InformaSeq come back screen-positive, again, it can still be a false positive, and the only way to know for sure is with an amnio. If your InformaSeq comes back screen positive, professional guidelines recommend you receive written resources and referral to support resources. You can find those at the Prenatal Resources Tab on this site.         Elyse Avelar  says:    March 30, 2016 at 1:07 pm     Do you think the 2/100 odds are too low given my age? I have been seeing a lot of people with higher odds- and older than me. I did not understand that since the Genetics Counselor stated that a low PAPP-A wasn’t such a big deal and she believes the baby would be fine.         Mark Leach  says:    March 30, 2016 at 1:16 pm     The way you relayed the 2/100 odds, that is what is considered the positive predictive value (PPV), i.e. the likelihood that your child has Down syndrome. Actually, though, having rerun my own calculations based on estimates of the accuracy of the NT-combined and your maternal age, your PPV would be 2% based on the NT-combined. Because the chance of having a child with Down syndrome increases with the mother’s age, that is why you’re seeing higher odds with older mothers–because PPV is a reassessment of your baseline chance for having a child with Down syndrome based on your age. As your Genetic Counselor advised you, based on the NT-combined result, you have a 98% chance that your child does not have Down syndrome. The InformaSeq will provide a further revision of these probabilities.               Keri  says:    March 31, 2016 at 3:36 am     Mark, I posted back on Feb 26th, 2016.  I wanted to update you on the soft markers.  I am now 31 weeks and the markers have dissappeared (pylectasis and EIF).  In your professional opinion would this lower my risk?  The baby’s growth is perfect and they do not see any other problems as of now.  I just can’t stop obsessing about this and can’t wait until our sweet girl gets here.  I just thought I would see what you thought.  I appreciate all of your feedback. Thank you.         Mark Leach  says:    March 31, 2016 at 10:39 am     Thank you for following up. Just so you know, I’m an attorney and bioethicist, so my opinion should not be relied upon for professional medical advice. That said, I do not think the resolution of the anatomical soft markers have any bearing on whether your child has an extra 21st Chromosome (the cause of Down syndrome) or not. I would still put your PPV at 80% based on your MaterniT21 result. I hope the resources I linked to in my earlier reply were helpful and that your medical team has been supportive as you have continued your pregnancy. I wish you a healthy delivery.         KERI  says:    May 26, 2016 at 8:52 am     Mark,  I followed this post through my whole pregnancy. My percentage with maternity 21 testing was 80% chance she had DS.  My baby was born this past Monday 5/23/16 @ 1136am and it was confirmed at birth that she indeed does have down syndrome. She is healthy as a horse and she is beautiful. I wanted to thank you for all of your knowledge and for sharing it with us.  Keri         Mark Leach  says:    May 26, 2016 at 12:44 pm     Keri–I’m glad to hear that what has been shared here was helpful–really the reason for doing this! I’m also glad to hear that your daughter is doing well. Every child is different just as we all are, so there is no set path. However, I do share about my daughter so that it’s a vision of what life can be like, at least for her. This past Sunday, we attended her third dance recital and yesterday, we attended her graduation from Elementary School. Here’s a post on her dance recital from 2014 with video of her performing. I hope you have similar happy times to look forward to with your little girl.         KERI  says:    May 29, 2016 at 1:18 am     Thank you so much for sharing that with me. She is an amazing dancer! Congrats to her on the photo contest too, that is a wonderful accomplishment. I have no doubts for my baby girl! I know she will move mountains. I will get her involved in as much as possible. I can’t wait to see how she will flourish. Thank you again for the information throughout my pregnancy. I was rather obsessed with reading and learning  as much as I could and your blog is one I kept coming back to. Thanks again! Keri                 Katie Lindsey  says:    May 17, 2016 at 8:41 pm     I am 25 years old and had an average nt measurement of 2.96 the doctor really scared me and started telling me this probably means our baby has down syndrome or one of the trisomy’s I’m worried we did the inmoraseq test and waiting for results         Mark Leach  says:    May 18, 2016 at 2:47 pm     Your doctor is incorrect. At your age, the NT screen would not result in a more probable than not recalculation of the chances you are having a child with Down syndrome. When you receive your cell free DNA screen results, use the links at this post to determine what your chances are and to find resources that should be helpful for you and your doctor.           kim  says:    May 19, 2016 at 10:01 am     I’m 26 and the screening came back positive. just like everyone eels, I’m nervous that the child will have ds. the doctor did tell me that there is a very low risk of having ds. I’m going to the specialist to find out more. I’m very worried         Mark Leach  says:    May 21, 2016 at 11:19 am     At your age, a screen positive result would mean you have a 47% chance that it is a false positive. Please see this post and the links in it for helpful resources to understand your test results and supportive resources about Down syndrome.         kim  says:    May 21, 2016 at 5:11 pm     would it come out positive if the due date is wrong?         Mark Leach  says:    May 21, 2016 at 5:55 pm     It depends on what test you had. If you had conventional screening, like a Nuchal Translucency or a quad, then, yes, the gestation date is factored into the algorithm. With cell free DNA, not so much, since the primary driver for accuracy there is how much cell free DNA from the pregnancy was included in the sample–though the later the pregnancy, the more accurate cell free DNA screening is precisely because there is more cell free DNA as the pregnancy goes along.               Amanda  says:    May 25, 2016 at 3:09 am     Hi Mark. It took quite a few hours of surfing the web before I stumbled across your page, but it was worth the wait to find it. My husband and I decided 8 years into our marriage to try to have a child; I was 35. I already had concerns at that time because of my age, and because of various health problems (IBS and severe arthritis throughout my body). About a year after we made the decision, my husband fell ill, so after a few years I figured it wasn’t in the cards. Imagine my surprise when last June (at age 40) I found myself pregnant. I had a lot of problems from day one: constant pain, and an overwhelming feeling that something wasn’t right. They did the quad testing and kept telling me that everything was “fine with the baby”, but didn’t really seem all that concerned with my overall physical health. My husband and I insisted on amnio (even though they kept asking me if I was absolutely sure I wanted to do that since all the bloodwork they did said everything was fine), along with the FISH test. When they got the results of the FISH test they told us there was a high probability that the baby had Downs, but to not get too concerned until the final results of the amnio. Two days later it was confirmed the baby had Trisomy-21. We decided to terminate the pregnancy. 2 weeks later when the clinic preformed an ultrasound before the procedure, we found that the baby had already passed. I have major concerns about trying to have another child, and everyone seems to have different numbers as far as the odds of this happening again. I don’t know if I can go through that heartbreak again, especially since I’ll be 42 in a few months. I know a lot of women are conceiving later in life, but I have to wonder if the ones who are having successful pregnancies are in good health overall, or if that even matters. A lot of places online don’t mention how the women are health-wise, just that they are a(n) “advanced maternal age”. Thanks for reading my ramble, any advice would be greatly appreciated.         Mark Leach  says:    May 25, 2016 at 12:17 pm     I am not aware of other health issues being related to the incidence for Down syndrome. Therefore, based on your age and having had a previous pregnancy positive for Trisomy 21, according to the National Society of Genetic Counselors (see page 3, Table 1, column 1), your chances are 1.7 times your base-line, age-based chance. Based on an age-based chance at 42 of around 1:65, multiplied by 1.7 (for the previous pregnancy), your revised baseline chance is around 2.6%. That said, I would recommend meeting with a genetic counselor about pre-pregnancy counseling to ask this and other questions you likely have.           Vic  says:    June 19, 2016 at 6:18 am     Hi Mark.  My wife is 12weeks pregnant and after an ultrasound where the doctor can’t see any nose bone and the fluid between the baby’s nape and the skin is thick, he suggested CVS. My wife also had blood test and it came back high risk for ds as well. The FISH results from the CVS came back positive. Is there any chance that the tests are false positives? How accurate is the CVS test really? Because we were told that it’s a 100% accurate. Should we go for Amniosintesis? Hope you can provide us some light         Mark Leach  says:    June 19, 2016 at 1:36 pm     CVS is not 100% accurate. It tests chorionic villi from the placenta which can be cells that develop into the fetus and cells that develop into the placenta. Therefore, the test result could be of cells from the placenta with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), or it could be that your child has mosaic Down syndrome, where only a portion of the child’s cells has an extra 21st Chromosome. FISH results are to be considered screen results only and not diagnostic. CVS is considered diagnostic, but it does have some false positives. At the same time, amniocentesis can also have false positives, but at a much lower rate. The most accurate test is amnio.           Tom  says:    July 8, 2016 at 7:57 am     Very interesting blog thank you. We are expecting twins and have been given a lower risk for downs of 1 in 386 and 1 in 382. I was wondering though if there is any correlation in risk in twins. We have also been told that it is most likely that they are not identical.         Mark Leach  says:    July 8, 2016 at 12:56 pm     Due to the incidence of twins being so low, coupled with the low incidence rate for Down syndrome, there just isn’t much out there on twins and Down syndrome. But I am not aware of there being any correlation in risk in twins.           Kylie  says:    July 29, 2016 at 3:15 am     Today was by far the scariest day of my life. I receive my blood results from my genetic testing and the DR told me I have 1 in 68 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. I’m 24 and this is my third child. I’m a couple days shy of 17 weeks. I’ve never had any concerns with my previous pregnancies. I have a high level ultrasound scheduled for next Friday 8 days from now. how could by blood test be wrong? I heard that the blood test could be a false positive but how could it be wrong? How could they get the chromosome count incorrect??         Mark Leach  says:    July 29, 2016 at 11:25 am     It depends on what test you had. But whatever test you had, you had what is called a screening test. Whether you had a conventional screening test of the nuchal combined test or one of the cell free DNA screening tests, being screening tests, they each have false positives and false negatives. As such, while they are testing either chemicals in your blood with a correlation to the chance for Down syndrome, or, in the case of cell free DNA, testing DNA that may be from the fetus or may just be from the placenta (see this post here for that explanation), there is a chance that their calculations are off. Based on your Doctor saying you have a 1-in-68 chance, that means you have a 1.4% chance of your scree result being a true positive and a 98.6% chance of it being a false positive. The odds are in your favor that your result is a false positive.         Kylie  says:    August 10, 2016 at 5:24 am     After my level 2 ultrasound 2 soft markers were detected one on the heart and the other on the bowels. My risk increased to 20% according to the Dr for DS. I declined the amino to wait for the Maternit21 results to come in. Well today they did and I am now “positive for DS” the obgyn said the test is 99% accurate and expect the worse. I’m scared of the unknown. Should I in fact expect for my child to have DS?         Mark Leach  says:    August 10, 2016 at 2:42 pm     Tests like MaterniT21 are almost never 99% accurate, in the sense that no matter their results, it is the rarest of cases when it means you have a 99% chance of having a child with Down syndrome (see this post here). However, if your earlier results that you reported were based off of a conventional screening test, then using that 1-in-68 ratio results in the chances that your MaterniT21 test result is a true positive being 94%, with a 6% chance of your result being a false positive. Put another way, you have a 94% chance that your child has Down syndrome. You can find the calculator and more explanation about this at this post . With your test result, you should’ve received patient support information about Down syndrome. You can find those recommended resources at the Prenatal Resources Tab .               Susan McCarthy  says:    August 11, 2016 at 7:54 am     I am 37 and pregnant with my 4th lost my 3rd due to miscarriage. I had 2 normal pregnancies in my 20s and so far my pregnancy has been easy (knock on wood). From what I understand my chances of having a baby with ds are 1\186 chance, I am really scare that my hypothyroidism might make my risk factors even higher. No matter what happens I will love the baby no matter what I am just extrelly worried.         niki  says:    September 6, 2016 at 1:22 pm     Whats my percentage to have a ds baby if im 21 and i only had the blood test         Mark Leach  says:    September 6, 2016 at 1:59 pm     It depends on which “blood test” you are referring to. If you are referring to AFP or a first trimester serum sample combined with a measurement of your fetus’ neck, then whatever the result, you have a very large chance of any screen positive being a false positive. If you had one of the newer cell free DNA screens, like MaterniT21 or Harmony, then the chance of a screen positive being a true positive is 49%–meaning you have as good of a chance that it is a false positive as it being a true positive. You can find out more at this post and the links therein.           Marie White  says:    September 7, 2016 at 4:07 pm     I am having a difficult time understanding the Panorama Risk Score. My positive predictive value came back at 91% and the fetal fraction was 10.8%. The panorama risk score is >99/100. Does that mean that the chance for baby to have trisomy 21 is greater than 99 out of 100???         Marie White  says:    September 7, 2016 at 4:16 pm     Also, the dr attempted to check for nuchal translucency. He was never able to get the baby in full profile, but did a transvaginal ultrasound and tried to look that way. Is it still accurate if the baby was not in profile?         Mark Leach  says:    September 7, 2016 at 5:27 pm     It sounds as though what the report was relaying is that the 91% is your positive predictive value (PPV), i.e. the actual chance that your result is a true positive versus a false positive. See this post here and the links in that post on why these tests are almost never “99% accurate” and a calculator where you can enter your age and find out your PPV. I can’t answer the question about the nuchal scan, but regardless, a Panorama result would take precedence over that scan for the conditions that Panorama tests for.         Marie White  says:    September 7, 2016 at 6:06 pm     Thank you so much for your reply. I went to the calculator on the link and calculated the PPV. Can you tell me what makes this number different than the PPV that panorama listed on the report? Panorama report said 91% PPV and calculator via the link said 75%. What causes the disparity between those values? Thank you again for your reply in this difficult time.         Mark Leach  says:    September 8, 2016 at 10:40 am     That’s a question only Panorama could explain. You could ask your Genetic Counselor or whomever ordered the test to ask Panorama for an explanation.         Marie White  says:    September 8, 2016 at 10:43 am     Thanks again for taking the time to reply.                 Kari  says:    September 11, 2016 at 11:12 pm     Hello- I recently received a level 2 ultrasound and everything looks great with the baby except they said the nose bone was at 4.8 and it should’ve 5 or greater. They proceeded to tell me that my odds of having a baby with down is 1:10. I’m 36 years old and have two girls prior with nod own syndrome. I thought based off of this one thing that was done through an ultrasound seemed to increase the odds greatly. There were no other markers. what are your thoughts on this data that they have provided me with? I don’t want to do any testing, however that 1:10 has my mind running wild. Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    September 12, 2016 at 10:23 am     Nasal bone measurement is considered a “soft marker” and not recognized for an accuracy to base a 1:10 chance off of alone. I wonder where they got that from as it isn’t recognized in any professional organization’s guidelines for prenatal testing. I would challenge them on what their basis was for that risk score.         Kari  says:    September 15, 2016 at 6:30 pm     So based on your experience the odds would be more in our favor? Some research that I have read says that a shortened nasal bone is considered a “hard marker”, do you find this to be inaccurate based off of your research? I will definitely challenge them on this as I do have many questions. Thanks for your response.         Mark Leach  says:    September 16, 2016 at 10:22 am     Have them consult their professional organization’s guidelines, e.g. ACOG or NSGC. I’ve never seen a nasal bone referred to as as anything other than a soft marker.               Ashley  says:    September 28, 2016 at 4:12 pm     Hi, when I was 21yrs old I had my first child. He was born with DS. I was tested then and did not carry the gene for DS. At 31 yrs old My second child was born a heathy baby girl with no special needs. My husband and I tried for a 3rd child a year later and we miscarried at 18weeks. She was also downs. I had my chromosomes retested and still negative for the downs gene. Why do I keep having downs babies if I dont carry the gene?         Mark Leach  says:    September 29, 2016 at 8:01 pm     After having a child with Down syndrome, the chances of having another child with Down syndrome increase. Plus, as you age, your chances for having a child with Down syndrome increase. I would expect the combination of having had a child with Down syndrome and then a decade elapsing between your third pregnancy likely explains the increased chance. That said, your chance is still somewhere around 1% or a little higher. A genetic counselor could counsel you on your future chances for having a child with Down syndrome.           sonumaddythakur  says:    September 29, 2016 at 4:46 am     My wife is 27 year old and during pregenecy of 14 weeks quadple test shows increase risk of down syndrome as tri-21 1:98 and age risk 1:1192 should be go for aminocentesis? and also explain how much % risk is there for down syndrome         Mark Leach  says:    September 29, 2016 at 8:04 pm     The quad test, while it is an indicator of high risk, has far, far, far more false positives than true positives. If available, you may wish to consider having cell free DNA screening and then decide whether to risk a miscarriage with amniocentesis.           Izabela  says:    October 1, 2016 at 11:11 pm     I have question about my 1 st trimester screening results. DSR- aldough within normative range- is at intermediate level beging definded as Duwn syndrome risk between 1:300-1.1000 . An intermediate risk is susceptible to significant up – risking or singnificant down- ruskingdependi g upon the result of corelative screening studies such as modifier sequential screen, fetal DNA in material serum .how can I understand the test results?         Mark Leach  says:    October 6, 2016 at 11:39 am     I wish I could help, but I can’t make sense of these results either. I would consult with a genetic counselor or medical geneticist.           Ferial  says:    November 6, 2016 at 11:28 pm     Hi Mark, I’m 41.9 years old with the history of one miscarriage at age 41. I am pregnant again and 18 weeks now. I just received my SIPS results and it is positive screen for DS (1:110). My health practitioner missed the Nuchal translucency. So, my results are only based on the first and second semesters blood testes. I am very shocked, confused, and heartbroken. I read many posts that there could be a false positive, but I am still very hopeless. I had NIPT test a few days ago and still waiting for the results. I also had a detailed ultrasound on 17 W and 4 days (after getting my SIPS results) and no abnormalities was found. I searched a lot to find a website to calculate my odds myself for SIP but I do’n seem to find the one. I’d appreciate your comments about my situation. Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    November 7, 2016 at 12:00 pm     I’m unaware of a calculator for a SIPS result, but the published accuracy rates for Serum Integrated Prenatal Screening (SIPS) is around 85% detection with a 5% false positive rate. That does not mean you only have a 5% chance of a false positive–it means 5% of all SIPS patients will receive a false positive. From your report of 1:110, that means you have a 0.9% chance of actually having a child with Down syndrome and a 99.1% chance of it being a false positive. The screen report of 1:110 is actually longer odds than just your baseline chance based on your age, which would be around 1:70 or so.           Kayla/worried first time mommy  says:    November 9, 2016 at 10:37 am     Hi. So I’m 23 years old expecting my first baby. I had the NT done and the quad screening done in the first and second trimester. The first one came back good but after the second one it shows that I have a positive risk of the baby having Down syndrome. (1/100) I am worried because of how young I am that it came back positive at all. Is the false positive rate higher for me because of how young I am? And if so what are the chances of it being a false positive. I tried to use the ppv calculator but haven’t had any luck because I don’t know if I’m using it right? And is it true that there are a lot of false positives and that most baby’s are ok despite it being a positive risk? Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    November 9, 2016 at 11:50 am     It appears your quad report came back with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 1/100, i.e. that you have a 1% chance of actually having a child with Down syndrome and a 99% chance of your result being a false positive. Considering that disparity in odds, the odds are vastly in favor of your result being a false positive. Your relative young age would inform the PPV analysis, but if the 1/100 is the PPV for the test, then your age was already taken into account. You may want to confirm with your provider that the 1/100 is the PPV for the quad test. If so, then you have a 99% chance that your result is a false positive.         Stacie Marshall  says:    December 18, 2017 at 11:04 pm     Hello 32 yr 22 weeks into my second pregnancy ,1st ultasound and level 2 ultrasound both no markers. But quad materniti test, and amnio all came back positive does that mean its definite for DS next appt i have scripts for 3rd ultasound and echo on baby heart is this. Sure diagnosis on DS         Mark Leach  says:    December 19, 2017 at 10:21 am     If you had screen positive for your quad and MaterniT21 test and a positive amnio, then that is a diagnosis for Down syndrome. If you weren’t provided this, here is the link to the resource on Down syndrome that professional guidelines recommend accompany any positive test result.               DownsMom  says:    November 10, 2016 at 2:04 am     I have 2 daughters. 15 and 16. My youngest has Down Syndrome. I was 18 and 20 when I had them. I had the normal tests done when i was pregnant and everything came back normal. I didn’t know she was down syndrome until I had her. At first I was in denial about it. I was afraid. I did get very angry at a nurse one day for asking me if I knew she was Down Syndrome while I was pregnant would I have aborted her. There was no way. She was my baby and I loved her. I would not change her for anything in the world. She is the most loving and funny kid. She definitely has a personality to her. Yes she does go to the doctor often and has some health issues. But I am her mom and will protect and take care of her any way I can. So I am saying this to any other mother that is pregnant with a baby with Down Syndrome, please don’t even think of abortion. Please don’t pick and choose what child you think is best for you. They are such a gift. There is no love like no other than the love of your child, especially with DS. You are their protector, no matter the diagnosis. I am now 35 years old and 6 weeks pregnant. I don’t want to sound like a hypocrite but I am worried about having another baby with Down Syndrome. My daughter does take up most of my time and attention but I wouldnt have it any other way. I’m just worried about the health risks that come with DS…not myself but my baby.         Mark Leach  says:    November 10, 2016 at 8:41 am     I wish you a healthy pregnancy and delivery. High level ultrasounds may be able to allay some concerns you have about whether your child has any health issues.           Kayla/ worried first time mommy  says:    November 12, 2016 at 10:55 am     Ok so they said the same thing you did. They said the chance of my baby having Down syndrome is 1%. So that is reassuring but they still wanted me to take the maternit21 test and I did and am waiting on the results of that. I’m just kind of scared of getting another positive though. What are the chances of the materniti21 being a false positive for my age. With the chance of 99% that the baby doesn’t have Down syndrome I feel like as you said thats pretty good odds that my baby doesn’t. So I’m just kind of wondering what your thoughts are on that?         Mark Leach  says:    November 12, 2016 at 11:10 am     The 99% false positive chance is more an indicator of the lack of precision for conventional serum screening. MaterniT21 has a much higher detection rate for Down syndrome. Therefore, a screen negative result will mean a greater than 99% chance that your child does not have Down syndrome. A screen positive result would mean a 92% chance that your child has Down syndrome and an 8% chance that the result is a false positive, based off of your recalculated chance of 1/100 from your conventional screen.         Kayla/worried first time mommy  says:    November 12, 2016 at 11:43 am     Ok thanks for your help. So just a personal question. If it was you waiting on this test result would you feel as if there is a lot to worry about? Because I’m the type of person where when it comes to this kind of stuff I over stress and I know it’s not good for the baby but I would really like your honest opinion as if you feel I have a lot to worry about         Mark Leach  says:    November 12, 2016 at 12:16 pm     A difficult question for me to answer fairly. We did not undergo prenatal testing and my wife has said she was glad because she would have worried no matter the result. At the same time, when we learned postnatally that our daughter had Down syndrome, I was very sad and grieved for quite a while, worrying about what life would have in store for my little girl. It has only been in the experience of raising my daughter that I came to meet many other children and adults with Down syndrome, gain a better understanding about what their lives are like, and realize that all the things I worried about for my daughter are things that are years off in the future. By the time any of those concerns could happen, like where will she live, will she have a good job, and what can we do to minimize the risk of sexual assault (my worst fear), we will have parented her and lived with her for years and thousands of hours. Hopefully, having that time to prepare, we will be ready to handle whatever challenges come. I share all this just to say, if I were in your position, I would worry, because I did worry, but it’s only with the passage of time, the realization of how much support there is out there for my daughter and others like her with Down syndrome, that I now barely worry and instead revel in enjoying her grow up into her own person.               verushca  says:    December 2, 2016 at 2:05 am     Hi Mark, I’m 28 years old and pregnant with my second child. I had my first child at a very young age and in the time that I was pregnant with her, these types downs testing was not really done In SA so we never knew about these test during my first pregnancy,  my daughter was born in 2005 and is perfectly healthy and very clever. Now that I am pregnant again,  I had to go for an NT scan in my first trimester (which was not done with first pregnancy) everything came back normal accept the neck thickness which was 2.8mm because of that I had to go for downs blood screening and went to see a fetal assessment specialist yesterday,  she gave me the blood results and the papp-a result were not to good but the hcg was fine, they gave me a 1:96 result based on the blood and NT results,  we then did a complete level 2 scan and she scanned from head to toe saying she is happy with everything but then said at the end that there is a small white spot on the heart and colon. Which then gave me a 1:16result I then did amniocentesis and will have to wait 3 weeks for the results but in the meantime I am so stressed out about everything.  What are the chances that these test excluding the amnio could have been false and what are the chances that the white spots on the heart and colon can actually be nothing as this is the first time that they actually picked that up? Am I possibly being stressed out over nothing and maybe the doctors these days try and make a diagnosis too soon? Or pick something up on scans that might have nothing to do with down syndrome?  Are all these test really being done correctly with so many false positives?  Regards Verushca         Mark Leach  says:    December 7, 2016 at 2:42 pm     Verushca–the nature of screening tests, like the nuchal and the ultrasound, are that they are not definitive, so they always have false positives and false negatives. In your case, your providers quoted you the odds of around a 1% chance your child had Down syndrome based on the nuchal, which means a 99% chance that your child does not have Down syndrome. I’m not sure what they’re basing the 1:16 result for just the ultrasound, but even that is only a 6% chance of actually having Down syndrome and a 94% chance your child does not have Down syndrome. Anxiety is also commonly associated with screening results. I’m not sure how common or rare the ultrasound findings are for other children, but any ultrasound finding is simply a “soft marker,” meaning one that is associated with a condition but one that cannot be relied on as a true indicator of the condition. I hope the amnio results provide you certainty.           Stephanie  says:    December 9, 2016 at 10:53 am     Hi Mark! I just had my first prenatal appointment and was asked if I wanted to have the first trimester screening done. I’m 25 and I just want to know what exactly I’m looking at as far as the chances I will have a baby with DS. I know the odds are 1:1250 but what percentage am I looking at? Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    December 9, 2016 at 8:19 pm     Given your age and provided there are no other factors, e.g. prior aneuploidy miscarriage, sibling with aneuploidy, then your chances of having a child with Down syndrome would be 0.08%, with a 99.92% chance that you are not having a child with Down syndrome. Those percentages are based just off your age. If you had screening testing, that would recalculate your chances.         Stephanie  says:    December 10, 2016 at 12:28 pm     So screening alone changes your odds?         Mark Leach  says:    December 11, 2016 at 2:11 pm     Screening provides a recalculation of your odds, but screening always has false positives and false negatives.               Peter  says:    December 19, 2016 at 1:06 am     My wife is pregnant since 8/27 and I am wondering if there might be some miscalculation based on the “weeks” of pregnancy which might throw the blood test for T21/T18/T13 calculations off. She been tested for 1:55 for T21 yet she is only 27 going on 28 when delivering the baby. Might I ask how are the weeks calculated for term? From my calculation its only been 15 weeks when she took the blood test and shouldn’t the blood test for AFP, hCG, T21, T18 and T13 be taken during week 16 ~ 18? Would the earlier test throw the figures off? Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    December 19, 2016 at 2:28 pm     I believe the quad test is recognized for the aneuploidy conditions such as Down syndrome, but, that being said, appreciate that the quad result means your pregnancy has a 1.8% chance of actually being positive for Down syndrome and a 98.2% of being a false positive.           julie  says:    January 12, 2017 at 5:40 am     I’m 44 and this is my 8th pregnancy lol.All seven were born vaginally, healthy,zero problems whatsoever I wasn’t 44 tho either 🙂 my baby will be 9 in march .I’m about 7 weeks haven’t been to the docs yet and I can only imagine the he’ll I’m gonna catch from the ob  docs when I refuse any and all invasive precedures ..I personally think an amniocentesis is just one more risk factor to add to the list ..I say no ty ..I wonder tho if there’s percentages and numbers on the amnt.of pregnancies that have been adversely affected by the test itself..I doubt very seriously there’s a reliable count .what do you think?         Mark Leach  says:    January 13, 2017 at 2:49 pm     Congratulations on your pregnancy. The historically quoted number is that amnios have between a 0.5% and 1.0% chance of miscarriage associated with them. However, the more accurate number is the rate experienced by the doctor actually performing the procedure and the rate at the facility where the procedure is performed. Like anything, the more experience the doctor and facility have, the lower the rate of miscarriage.         nm  says:    January 13, 2017 at 7:31 pm     Hi I’m 16 weeks pregnant, I did the harmony test and came back 99% positive for T21 the nuchal translucency measures 4.5. I had the amnio 2 days ago and wating for results.         Mark Leach  says:    January 17, 2017 at 11:36 am     See these two posts here and here . In the second one, the calculator linked in it can show you your actual chance for having a child with Down syndrome (it’s not 99%). You’ll need to enter your age. The fact sheets should be helpful along with the resources on Down syndrome linked in the second post.               Sam  says:    January 17, 2017 at 9:49 am     Hi Mark, I’m due an amneocentisis based on the Quad test I had at 13 weeks pregnant, although I had this in previous 2 pregnancies I just agreed thinking all would be OK. Not the case this time around. My NT came back at 2mm my Papp-a was 0.85 but my beta hcg was super high at 9.22mom which should be only 1, scan was fine. My chances of having a baby with DS are 1 in 87, I’ve tried to get doctors and midwife to elaborate on this for me to understand but it’s like hitting a brick wall. Like they don’t know either. My only answer from the consultant was it is a very complex computer system that works out the odds! How? I am 34 now and have chosen amnio to get answers really as I need to know how to plan ahead. Yet I am an emotional wreck as I know despite the outcome I am putting my baby at risk of miscarriage and that as a mum to be is hard as we do everything we can in pregnancy to keep our babies safe. Having the amnio is like the ultimate betrayal and I’m not in a good place but i need to know. Wish I had never had the test as now I’m on an emotional roller coaster. Just need to know if hormone levels can still be high at 13 weeks? I’m clutching at straws but really dreading the amnio. Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    January 17, 2017 at 11:41 am     Unfortunately, I cannot interpret the mystery of screening algorithms either. They are usually proprietary to the lab and therefore are not shared publicly. Amnios are not to be performed before 15 weeks. You may have time before then to request a cell free DNA screening test, like MaterniT21, Harmony, or one available in your locale. Many moms are relying on a screen-negative result from those screening tests as the chance of a false negative is extremely low. With conventional screening, like quad and NT, on the other hand, the chance of a false positive typically exceeds the chance of a screen result being a true positive. In seeking information, you may also find helpful the professionally recommended resources on Down syndrome at this link .         Sam  says:    January 17, 2017 at 1:09 pm     Thank you for the reply Mark, I am now 15 weeks + 4 days. I have amnio booked in 2 days time, although don’t know if I will go through with this. I was going to pay for the harmony test privately at £405 as I am in the UK and it is not available on our NHS until 2018. I chose not to do this as I have been informed that it will only come back with a high/low risk and not a definitive answer. I have found this site very useful aswell and I believe my heart will takeover and fears I have in my mind so thank you.             Courtney  says:    January 31, 2017 at 7:56 am     I’m 21 and I already have a 3 yr old who is perfectly healthy with nothing wrong at all. Now pregnant with my second and had the screening test done and it showed positive for DS it says 1:300 is that a low risk?         Mark Leach  says:    January 31, 2017 at 10:47 am     A 1-in-300 chance that your pregnancy is positive for Down syndrome, means you have a 0.3% chance of having a child with Down syndrome and a 99.7% chance that you are not having a child with Down syndrome. Based on just your age, you had around a 1-in-1,400 chance of having a child with Down syndrome. So, your screen result is at a higher chance than just your age-based chance, which would be literally an “increased” chance. However, you can decide if a 0.3% chance is high risk. And, for perspective’s sake, feel free to check out some of the “ Our story ” posts to see how relatively healthy my daughter, who happens to have Down syndrome, is.           Jessica Scott  says:    March 23, 2017 at 9:37 am     I’m 39 and 16 weeks pregnant. I had the blood screening done 12 weeks and 6 days which came back with a 93% risk based on my age and the blood work for Down syndrome. The fluid behind baby’s neck measured at 2.5 mm. There were no other soft markers on the ultrasound. I had two miscarriages prior and no living children. Thus far this has been a wonderful pregnancy with the exception of the normal hormonal changes and an increase in my appetite. Since getting the results this is not sat well with me for obvious reasons. Both my husband and I earn credibly healthy, vibrant. My husband is even two years younger than me.  We have decided to go to another doctor and get a second opinion as I’ve never met with a doctor but only midwives and a genetic counselor. No one has treated me as high risk from the very beginning and now even with these results no one is talking to us about our questions and concerns. I stumbled across this article in my frantic search about Down syndrome and the likelihood that I’m carrying a child with it. This is been very informative so I thank you for all the information. Based on your knowledge how accurate do you think this blood test is that they’re given me? I will be 40 by the time I deliver which is in September.         Mark Leach  says:    March 23, 2017 at 12:09 pm     According to this calculator , the chance that your result is a true positive is 91% and the chance it is a false positive is 9%. I hope the second opinion provides the answers you are seeking. Professional guidelines also recommend that expectant mothers receive informational resources about Down syndrome with a test result. This link is to the one that is most recommended.           Michelle  says:    April 13, 2017 at 4:51 am     Hi Mark, I went for my 12 week scan and was told I have 1 in 7 chance of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality.  10 week Blood test showed I had ‘low’ levels Scan showed that the fluid behind the neck is between 3.6-3.9. And they said the blood flowing from the placenta is flowing but it is also flowing back- not sure how to describe it.  I had cvs two days ago and am waiting for the results.  Should I prepare myself for the worst?  Thanks for your help         Mark Leach  says:    April 13, 2017 at 8:31 am     I’m unclear on what they are basing the 1-in-7 chance–was it a cell free DNA screen result or just the NT measurement. If just the NT, that is not recognized by itself as a valid screen. And, even if the 1-in-7 is correct, that would still mean you have an 86% chance that your pregnancy is unaffected, i.e. you have an 86% chance that the screen result is a false positive.         Michelle  says:    April 13, 2017 at 3:47 pm     1/7 was based on my age of 34, blood tests and ultrasound screening.  They have just called to say that the preliminary CVS screening (taking cells from the placenta) is positive for Downs Syndrome. I have to wait until next week for the final result.  I can’t believe it! Im devastated!         Mark Leach  says:    April 14, 2017 at 1:57 pm     Receiving the diagnosis is often described as a shock and can take time to process. If you would like to learn more about Down syndrome, this link is for the resource recognized by the major professional medical organizations for expectant mothers. Another recommended resource is your local Down syndrome support organization. I hope these are helpful as you process what the diagnosis may mean.               Sophie  says:    April 24, 2017 at 11:43 am     Hello Mark. First of all your article is fantastic and clearly laid out, making it easy to understand so thank you. I’m currently 18 weeks pregnant and at my 12 week scan the doctor said that everything was normal as far as the soft markers are concerned. However the tri test results came back as 1:120 so we proceeded with an NIPT as we didn’t want the risk of the amniocentesis. That test has come back as positive… I will be doing the amnio tomorrow to be certain of course but there is something I don’t understand. Based on my age (32) I have calculated that I have a 34% chance of it being a false positive but the doctor told me that the test was 95% certain. My confusion comes from the fact that his ‘95%’ is neither the 66% that I have just calculated nor is it the ’99+%’ that the test claims to be… Would you know where his 95% comes from? If that makes sense… Thank you for your time. Sophie         Mark Leach  says:    April 24, 2017 at 7:53 pm     I was curious, too, what your doctor was basing that on, so I entered your revised prevalence rate based off your tri-result of 1:120, expecting that to report a 95% PPV. But, instead, the PPV is only 71%, leaving still a 29% chance of a false positive. So, I don’t know what he’s basing his number on and would be curious what he tells you.         Sophie  says:    April 25, 2017 at 12:42 pm     Well they said that it meant they were 95% sure that it’s a positive and that the remaining 5% was a margin that they give in case of error like mosaicism etc. Maybe I should have mentioned that I live in France so maybe the tests are different?? I did the amnio today and will have the results on Friday but the ultrasound showed that both brain ventricles are enlarged which does point to trisomy 21…         Mark Leach  says:    April 25, 2017 at 3:07 pm     It sounds as though the “95%” figure has no basis except to express that they’re “pretty sure” the test is positive, but it might have a false positive.               Christine  says:    May 16, 2017 at 12:59 pm     I stumbled upon some of your articles regarding the nipt screening while trying to research the outcome of results that I received. At 13 weeks and 4 days I had an nt scan which returned a measurement of 3.6 and I had the nipt blood test which came back with a positive result for trisomy 21. I am 36 years old and have 2 other children without down syndrome.  My doctor tells me the chance of a false positive result on the nipt is .02% that the test is 99.94% accurate as matter of fact the doctor told me the baby has down syndrome without a diagnostic test.  The genetic counselor tells me that the results are most likely accurate but I should confirm results with an amnio. Do you think the info I have been provided is accurate.  Based on what I read the false negative results seem like they may be slightly higher or am I just reaching for false hope?         Mark Leach  says:    May 20, 2017 at 3:41 pm     The information your OB gave you amounts to malpractice . The NT measurement, by itself, is not recognized as a valid screen. Based on your age, your NIPT result actually means you have an 82% chance that it is a true positive and an 18% chance that it is a false positive. (see this calculator here ). Feel free to share with your OB the fact sheets on NIPT available at this post or report him or her to your board of medical licensure to prevent further misinformation.         Christine  says:    May 21, 2017 at 9:16 am     Thanks Mark! I tried to explain to him that I thought he was wrong about the 99.4% but he was not changing his mind. I had an amnio on Thursday and truthfully either way I think now I need a new doctor. Doctors (the person I am trusting with my life and baby’s) should be providing accurate info and not that I wouldn’t still be worried with an 82% chance but a diagnosis before we know for sure has caused lots of anxiety the last 3 weeks that could have been lessened if a different approach was taken.             Michelle  says:    May 26, 2017 at 9:02 am     I recieved a High Risk for T21 using harmony blood test. I am 40, had a CVS today found an absent nasal bone and only 1 artery to the unbilical cord instead of 2. Is there any hope my result will come back normal or what percentage would I have.  Only have my husband for support         Mark Leach  says:    May 30, 2017 at 10:02 am     Based on your age and your Harmony result, you have a 7% chance that it is a false negative. Nasal bone and umbilical arteries are trumped by the Harmony result as far as indicators of T21. You can learn more about T21 from this resource recommended by all major medical organizations.           JaNY  says:    November 13, 2017 at 6:24 am     Hi! I would love to know your opinion. I’m 37 years old. No DS background in either side (me or my husband) I had the Harkony test done result was Negative T21 came out with a chance of 1/226 Nuchal fluid was borderline 2,5mm Nasal bone is present. They have offered the amino but I refused since the abortion chances are high. But I had 1 soft mark in my screenings. They said based in tests and my maternal age chances are T21 1:226 and 99.5 chance of not having a DS Child. I’m currently 18 weeks and just had the early anatomy and it looks good. Baby is growing fine. Waiting on my fetal heart screening next week and the late anatomy in 2 weeks. I refused to have the amino fone because of the miscarriage risks. What is your opinion in my Case? Thank you so much.  (Even with all the results looking okay I’m still worried about the soft mark)         Mark Leach  says:    November 13, 2017 at 12:05 pm     The Harmony test result trumps any other screen for Down syndrome/T21. If the Harmony test resulted screen negative for T21, then the soft marker should not be considered an indicator of T21. An option few are counseled about is that you could have another cell free DNA screen like Harmony done. cfDNA screens improve in accuracy as the pregnancy progresses; if that second cfDNA screen was screen negative, then it would be incredibly unlikely that it would be a false negative. Usually, though, a second cfDNA screen must be paid out of pocket.           Lita Solstice  says:    December 19, 2017 at 12:49 pm     My mothers doctor recommended she abort me and my sister on the basis we ‘might’ have downs syndrome. Both born 9 yrs apart. Both born healthy babies. This is in Canada. What scares me is to think how many healthy babies are gone because of this recommendation. How many mothers traumatized by losing a baby. The stress and toll this takes on anyone who loses a child is a lot. My mother had already lost a child in womb and she was not willing to lose another. Her doctors told her with me I’d have downs and a hole in my heart and I wouldn’t survive out of womb. They were wrong. She called me her miracle child, because despite everything the doctors told her, she had me, and I was healthy baby. So knowing how unlikely it would be to have a child with downs, especially in your twenties, it makes me worry about how many precious lives we lose because of a doctors recommendation.         Monique  says:    February 17, 2018 at 8:49 am     Hi Mark, I know it’s been about a year since you’ve been up here but I stumbled across your article and it seems to be very informative. Even the responses you have given to the other commenters. My questions is this…. I recently did the blood work for all 3 chromosomal testing and everything came back negative it was 99.9% but when I had my ultrasound at 19weeks the doctor stated that my daughter has a short nasal bone and now my chances are 1/500. Ever since then I’ve been extremely worried crying every night. Can you please share some insight on this maybe to relieve some of my stress. They told me to talk to genetics but I just don’t want to go through an amnio and my baby is fine. Please help!!!         Mark Leach  says:    February 17, 2018 at 9:38 am     According to current professional guidelines, cell free DNA screening trumps any ultrasound soft marker like short nasal bone.

 My risk factor was 1 in 14. My AFP levesl and HCG were very high. I had a level II ultrasound and they were no indicators. I also had an amnio. I cried and stress for two weeks, and today I got my results. My baby does not have down syndrome. So please try not to worry. My risk was very high and my baby's chromosomes are normal. I wish you the best of luck!                 firstbabymama    Answered 10/1/07               108 found this helpful     Im sure there is nothing to worry about. I tested positive for down syndrome and my risk was 1 in 167. So I have been doing a lot of research on the Screening test. Most women who have positive screenings have healthy babies. Look at it this way your chances of having a baby with down syndrome is very slim. 1/197 means that there is a 99.5% chance that your baby does not have down syndrome. Thats not bad odds at all. Have you had a level II ultrasound done? Because they can check for markers on the baby, and if none are present it can make your risk even lower. I had one done and no markers were found. My risk went down to 1/350. It can be very reasuring when no markers are found on the ultrasound. Well good luck to you Im sure there is nothing to be scared of!              Anonymous   Answered 9/16/07               71 found this helpful     I understand what it feels like to live with that fear. After a similar test, my husband and I decided to have further tests. In the end we had a positive diagnosis and we are now know that we are expecting a baby girl with Down syndrome. I think having half the information was worse than all the information. We have been doing research to understand Down syndrome better and have found that this is not a terrible diagnosis. These babies may reach milestones a little later but hey, life is not a race. They may also have some health challenges but so can any baby. These children can contribute to their world very well. It is nothing to be afraid of. HOWEVER, I do recommend if you are paralyzed by your vague diagnosis. Have further tests and then do your research. You never know how you may feel once you are informed fully.

I also got the call at work from my doctor saying the quad screen had tested positive for downs and I was hysterical until I met with the genetic councelor the next day. My odds were 1 in 204, which in percentage terms was like only a .5% chance he had it (or in other words, a 99.5% chance he didn't!). We then had the ultrasound and found he had a short femur which brought the odds to 1 in 136, still less than a 1% chance. Decided not to have the amnio and just be positive instead, we'd have the baby regardless so what's the point? Anyway, I had a completely healthy bouncing baby boy. I was kicking myself later for worrying so much, I will never have that quad test again, the margin for error is ridiculous! Good luck and enjoy the pregnancy!                 kmdmom72    Answered 12/11/07               62 found this helpful     For others reading, I wanted to share our good news -- I'm the 39 year old who was told I had a 1 in 11 risk. The results came yesterday, and our little girl is 100% healthy! 46 chromosomes....NORMAL!! We are so totally thrilled and relieved! Again, if you are over 35 and are encouraged to get the amnio, reconsider the 2nd trimester triple or quad screening blood work (all 4 of my markers indicated elevated risk), and go straight for the definitive results of the amnio. If you're worried about the risks of the amnio, I took 2 days off from work, and had my husband walk the dog for a week -- I really allowed by body to recover. Best of luck to all you mothers!              Anonymous   Answered 11/8/07               44 found this helpful     My risk factor was 1 in 5, so I had CVS to find out the truth. My risk level is by far the highest among the readers here, but my result came back negative. My baby is normal! So I just want to encourage those who have better risk level than mine. A lot of times the test result come back normal despite it is 1/5 or 1/200. Hope this will ease some of your mind.                 anchiingrid    Answered 8/17/09               42 found this helpful     I too tested (not positive) but at a higher risk for Down Syndrome. I think it is important to distinguish that you are not positive for the syndrome you just have an increased chance for this. i have two boys 10 and 6. This yest was not even offered to me when i was pregnant with them. To my surprise the doctor called and told me my elevated risk was 1:175. After much research and genetic counselling i have decided not to have the amnio done. the risk is around the same for miscarriage from the amnio. I have read much about these tests recently and would never have them done again.It is so uncertain, you may have this....but it doesn't mean you do. I mean even a negative result does not mean you won't have a child with DS. I feel confident that the odds are not against you or myself and after researching Down Syndrome alot I found that most families with child with DS praised their children and thought their lives better for it. Many children with DS have jobs and live &quot;normal&quot; lives.                 shadylady    Answered 10/17/07               38 found this helpful     I need the truth I am pregnant or at least I was up until I had my 10 weeks positive down syndrome test on the 12th of this month. I am heartbroken. I am waiting until next weekand requesting another test before they do something. i am sorry for asking. I am desperate                 kissesmany    Answered 2/24/17               36 found this helpful     My wife tested positive for Down Syndrome. Her risk was 1 in 243. The doctor scheduled us in for a Level II ultrasound and to speak with a geneticist. The ultrasound did not show and soft markers, so the doctor said we didn't need to do anymore testing if we felt comfortable with what we had seen and heard. For our own peace of mind, we went ahead with the amniocentesis. The procedure did not take very long and my wife said it did not hurt that much. Well, we got the results back yesterday and everything was fine! Our baby girl has the right number of chromosomes. It's only natural to worry if your blood test indicates a possibility for DS, but remember most women will have normal babies. We are just one more couple who have proven this to be the case.

People with Down syndrome may have physical problems, learning problems and distinct physical features.    Many people with Down syndrome are healthy, but some need medical care for birth defects or other health conditions.    Talk to your health care provider or a genetic counselor to learn about testing for Down syndrome.         What is Down syndrome?    Down syndrome (also called trisomy 21) is the most common chromosomal condition in the United States. A chromosomal condition happens when there’s a problem in one or more chromosomes. Chromosomes are the structures that hold genes. Genes are part of your body’s cells that store instructions for the way your body grows and works.  About 1 in 700 babies (less than 1 percent) is born with Down syndrome. Many children with Down syndrome lead healthy, active lives. They go to school, play sports and enjoy being social with others. A person with Down syndrome may live 60 years or more.     What causes Down syndrome?    Each person has 23 pairs of chromosomes in every cell in their body. For each pair, you get one chromosome from your mother and one chromosome from your father. Babies with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21. This extra copy changes the way the brain and body develop.  We don’t know for sure why Down syndrome happens. It may be that the egg or sperm that come together in fertilization has an extra chromosome. Fertilization is when a man’s sperm gets inside a woman’s egg to make her pregnant. One kind of Down syndrome (called translocation Down syndrome) can be passed from a parent to a child, but it’s rare.     Your age when you get pregnant affects your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. The older you are, the higher your risk. If you get pregnant:   At age 25, your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is 1 in 1,340.  At age 30, your risk is 1 in 940.  At age 35, your risk is 1 in 353.  At age 40, your risk is 1 in 85.  At age 45, your risk is 1 in 35.   If you already have a baby with Down syndrome, your risk for having another increases with each pregnancy. Up to age 40, for each pregnancy your chances of having another baby with Down syndrome is about 1 in 100 (1 percent). After age 40, the risk is based your age. Talk to a genetic counselor to understand your risk. A genetic counselor is a person who is trained to help you understand about genes, birth defects and other medical conditions that run in families and how they can affect your health and your baby's health.    What are the different kinds of Down syndrome?  There are three kinds of Down syndrome:   Trisomy 21. This is the most common kind. About 95 in 100 people with Down syndrome (95 percent) have trisomy 21. In this condition, your baby’s cells have three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two.  Mosaic Down syndrome. People with this condition have some cells with three copies of chromosome 21, but other cells have the usual two copies. Mosaic Down syndrome is rare. People with Mosaic Down syndrome may have fewer characteristics of Down syndrome because they have some cells with the two copies of chromosome 21.  Translocation Down syndrome. This condition happens when a person has two copies of chromosome 21, plus an extra part of a chromosome or a whole extra chromosome that’s attached (also called translocated) to one copy of chromosome 21. This condition is rare, and it can be inherited (passed from parent to child).     Can you find out during pregnancy if your baby has Down syndrome?    Yes. Health care providers offer testing for Down syndrome to all pregnant women as part of regular prenatal care (medical care during pregnancy). You can decide if you want to have these tests. Talk to your health care provider or a genetic counselor about testing for Down syndrome.  If you or your partner has a family history of Down syndrome, tell your health care provider or genetic counselor. Family history means that someone in either of your families has the condition. Use our family health history form to help you find out if certain health conditions run in your families.      There are two kinds of prenatal tests to check for Down syndrome:     Screening tests. These tests check if your baby is more likely than others to have Down syndrome. There are no risks to you or your baby when you have a screening test, but they don’t tell you for sure if your baby has a condition like Down syndrome.  Diagnostic tests. These tests tell you for sure if your baby does or doesn’t have Down syndrome. If a screening test shows your baby is at high risk of Down syndrome, your provider may recommend a diagnostic test to confirm the results.      Each kind of test has pros and cons. Screening test results can help you decide if you want to have a diagnostic test. You may or may not want to know for sure during pregnancy if your baby has Down syndrome. If you do find out for sure, you can learn about the condition so you’re prepared when your baby’s born. You also can make plans to give birth in a hospital that can give your baby special medical care .  What screening tests are used for Down syndrome?  Screening tests are called noninvasive because your provider doesn’t need to use tools that break your skin or enter your body. Instead, you get a blood test or an ultrasound. Ultrasound is a prenatal test that uses sound waves and a computer screen to show a picture of your baby inside the womb.     Screening tests for Down syndrome include:     First trimester screening (also called first trimester combined test). Your provider uses these test results and your age to estimate your chances of having a baby with Down syndrome. This test is usually done at 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. It has two parts:​    Blood test. This measures levels of plasma protein-A (also called PAPP-A) and a pregnancy hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (also called HCG) in your blood. If your PAPP-A and HCG levels aren’t normal, your baby may have Down syndrome.  Nuchal translucency test . Your provider uses this special kind of ultrasound to measure the tissue at the back of your baby’s neck (called the nuchal fold). Extra fluid in the nuchal fold may be a sign that your baby may have Down syndrome.          Integrated screening test. Your provider uses these two tests to estimate the chances that your baby has Down syndrome: ​    First trimester. You get a blood test to check your PAPP-A levels and an ultrasound to measure your baby’s nuchal fold. This test is usually done at 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy.​  Second trimester. You get a maternal blood test (also called quad screen) to measure four substances in your blood: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), estriol, HCG and inhibin A. The test is usually done at 15 to 22 weeks of pregnancy.      Cell-free DNA testing (also called noninvasive prenatal screening or testing or NIPT). This test checks your blood for your baby’s DNA to see if he may have Down syndrome. You can have this test as early as 9 weeks of pregnancy. If you’re at high risk of having a baby with Down syndrome, your provider may recommend this test. It’s not recommended if you aren't likely to have a baby with a birth defect or if you’re pregnant with multiples (more than one baby, like twins or triplets).         What diagnostic tests are used for Down syndrome?    If a diagnostic test for Down syndrome is positive, it means your baby has the condition. If it’s negative, your baby doesn’t have Down syndrome. Diagnostic tests are called invasive because your provider uses a needle to take a sample of your baby’s blood, amniotic fluid or tissue for testing. There is a risk of miscarriage with diagnostic tests. Miscarriage is when a baby dies in the womb before 20 weeks of pregnancy.     Diagnostic tests for Down syndrome include:     Amniocentesis (also called amnio). This test takes some amniotic fluid from around your baby in the uterus (also called womb) to check for Down syndrome. You can get an amnio at 15 to 20 weeks of pregnancy.  Chorionic villus sampling (also called CVS). This test checks tissue from the placenta to see if a baby has Down syndrome. You can get CVS at 10 to 13 weeks of pregnancy.  Cordocentesis (also called percutaneous umbilical cord sampling or PUBS). Your provider inserts a thin needle into an umbilical cord vein to take a small sample of your baby’s blood to check for chromosome defects. You can get this test between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. There’s a much greater risk of miscarriage with cordocentesis than with amnio or CVS, so you only get this test if other tests are unclear and your provider can’t confirm your baby has Down syndrome any other way.       How are babies with Down syndrome diagnosed after birth?    After birth, your baby’s provider gives your baby a physical exam and checks for common physical characteristics of Down syndrome. To confirm your baby has Down syndrome, she sends a sample of your baby’s blood to a lab for testing.  What are some physical characteristics of a person with Down syndrome?  A person with Down syndrome may have distinct physical characteristics, including:  Facial features. Most babies with Down syndrome have some, but not all of these characteristics:   A flattened face, with a flat nose  Almond-shaped eyes that slant up  A small mouth  A tongue that may stick out of the mouth  Tiny white spots on the iris (colored part) of the eye       Other physical characteristics. Babies and children with Down syndrome may have some of these characteristics:     A short neck  Small hands and feet. They also may have a single line across the center of the palm of the hand (also called a palmar crease) or small pinky fingers that curve towards the thumb.  Small ears that may fold over a little at the top  Low muscle tone (also called hypotonia) or loose joints. Babies with Down syndrome have low muscle tone at birth. They may seem floppy and have poor head control.  Short height       How does Down syndrome affect your child’s health and development?    Most people with Down syndrome are healthy, but some need special medical care. Common health and development problems in people with Down syndrome include:      Congenital heart defects . These are heart conditions a baby’s born with that can affect the heart’s shape or how it works, or both. About half of babies with Down syndrome have congenital heart defects. Like all babies, babies with Down syndrome get heart screening as part of newborn screening tests before they leave the hospital after birth. Babies with Down syndrome also get checked by a pediatric cardiologist, a doctor who treats babies and children with heart problems. If your baby has a congenital heart defect, treatment may include taking medicines or having heart surgery.  Hearing loss . This is when your baby can’t hear sound in one or both ears. About 3 in 4 babies with Down syndrome (75 percent) have hearing loss. Like all babies, babies with Down syndrome get screened for hearing loss as part of newborn screening. Your baby also needs follow-up hearing tests every 6 months and may need to see an ear, nose and throat (also called ENT) doctor who specializes in treating babies and children (called a pediatric ENT). Your baby may need ear tubes. These are tiny tubes placed through the ear drum to allow air into the middle ear and prevent fluids from building up behind the ear drum.  Intellectual and developmental disabilities. These are problems with how the brain works that can cause a person to have trouble or delays in physical development, learning, communicating, taking care of himself or getting along with others. Babies with Down syndrome may reach developmental milestones later than other babies. A developmental milestone is a skill or activity that most children can do at a certain age. Milestones include sitting, walking, talking, having social skills and having thinking skills. Getting early intervention services as soon as possible can help improve your baby’s development. The services can help children from birth through 3 years learn important skills, like how to talk, walk and interact with others. To find out about early intervention services in your state, visit the Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center .  Sleep disorders, like obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is when your child’s breathing stops and starts during sleep because her airway becomes narrow or blocked. Snoring is the most common sign of obstructive sleep apnea. Children with sleep apnea often have larger tonsils and adenoids than other children. Tonsils and adenoids are lymph tissues near the throat that help protect the body from infection. All children with Down syndrome should be checked for obstructive sleep apnea during an overnight sleep study in a hospital before they’re 4 years old. Your child wears sensors, and a team of health care providers checks your child’s breathing, blood oxygen levels and brain waves while she sleeps. Treatment for sleep disorders may include wearing a mask to help your child breathe during sleep or surgery to remove your child’s tonsils and adenoids.  Vision problems. More than half of children with Down syndrome have vision problems. An eye doctor called a pediatric ophthalmologist checks your baby’s vision at birth and at 1 year. Children with Down syndrome need regular eye exams. She may need glasses, surgery or other treatments to help improve her vision.   Some children with Down syndrome have other conditions, including:   Blood disorders. Your baby gets yearly blood tests to check for problems, like low iron or anemia. Anemia is when you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the rest of your body. It’s rare, but some children with Down syndrome may have a blood cancer called leukemia. These children are treated by a pediatric hematologist-oncologist, a doctor who treats children with blood disorders and cancer. They may need chemotherapy (medicines used to treat cancer).  Dental problems. Your baby may develop teeth more slowly, in a different order or have fewer teeth than other children.  Infections. Babies with Down syndrome tend to get sick often because their bodies have trouble fighting off infections. Make sure your baby gets all of her vaccinations on time. Vaccinations help protect your baby from certain diseases.  Microcephaly . This is a birth defect in which a baby’s head is smaller than expected, compared to babies of the same sex and age. Some babies with microcephaly have smaller brains that may not develop properly. To diagnose microcephaly if your baby has Down syndrome, your baby’s provider measures your baby’s head circumference and compares it to other babies with Down syndrome who have microcephaly. Head circumference is the distance around your baby’s head.  Low muscle tone. Babies with low muscle tone may have trouble with sucking, feeding, weight gain and bowel movements. If your baby has poor muscle tone, she may have delays in meeting developmental milestones, like rolling over, sitting up, crawling and walking.  Problems with the intestines, like Hirschsprung disease. The intestines are long tubes that are part of your body’s digestive system. Your digestive system helps your body break down food, take in nutrients and remove waste. Hirschsprung disease happens when the large intestine (also called the colon) is blocked. Babies with Hisrchsprung disease need surgery to remove part of colon that isn’t working well.  Neck or spine problems. Bones in the neck or spine can be unstable and increase your child’s risk of spinal cord injury. Some children need surgery.  Thyroid problems. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that makes hormones (chemicals) that help the body use and store energy. Babies with Down syndrome may have low thyroid hormone levels. If not treated, this can affect your baby’s growth and development. Your baby gets checked for thyroid problems as part of newborn screening and has follow-up tests every year. Thyroid problems are treated with medicine.

How Frequently Does Down Syndrome Occur? Down Syndrome (formerly called mongolism), named after Dr. Langdon Down, who described these children in 1866, occurs in one out of seven hundred births. The chance of having a Down Syndrome baby increases with the age of the mother. Women under age 23—1 in 2,000 births Women at age 30—1 in 1,300 births Women at age 35—1 in 400 births Women at age 40—1 in 90 births Women at age 45—1 in 32 births Women at age 50—1 in 8 births Depending on how they are presented, these figures can be scary. If a doctor says to a mother, “At age thirty-five you have five times the chance of having a Down Syndrome baby than you did at age twenty,” that would scare many senior mothers from conceiving. Here’s how I present the risk factors to my patients who ask. At age twenty you had a 99.95 percent chance of not delivering a baby with Down syndrome; at age thirty-five your chances of not delivering a baby with Down Syndrome are 99.75 percent. Doesn’t that figure sound more reassuring? This is why, in my opinion, the “thirty-five-year-old scare” is too young, forty-five perhaps? Even at age forty-five you have a 97 percent chance of delivering a baby without Down Syndrome. So, for mothers of later childbearing age, these figures are looking up.   Because of these risk factors, we believe that it is unwarranted to scare a thirty-five-year-old mother into prenatal diagnostic tests (either amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling). Weigh these facts: At age thirty-five your statistical chance of delivering a Down Syndrome baby is 0.25 percent. However, the risk of damage to a normal preborn baby during these tests may be around 1 percent. At present, the AFP (alpha fetal protein) test is inaccurate for the prenatal diagnosis of Down Syndrome and is a source of much needless worry to pregnant parents. Whether or not you have a prenatal diagnostic testing is an individual judgment call between you and your doctor. But remember, your doctor is legally obligated to offer these tests to any mother thirty-five years of age or older. Related Articles Why does Down Syndrome Occur?

I'm not sure if it was the blood work or the ultrasound. During ultra sound tech had a hard time measuring the neck bc the baby wouldn't move she said she was off by a millimeter. She tried for 45 minutes to get the perfect measurement. I don't know what to think but doc is sending me for the cvs Monday. I'm not sure why I can't do the NIpT blood test instead.

T  TinaYouFatLard @TinaYouFatLard  There is always possibilities that what they say is wrong. Just have hope and pray and remember your baby is a blessing :) A  AnnelXo Pray & have faith!

Sometimes God tests your faith in mysterious ways. m  mrsalbertson1 I was told the exact same thing when I was pregnant with my daughter I was 18 and scared to death. They sent me to a 3d ultrasound that did all the measurements and said everything looked fine so they gave me the option of amniocentesis or giving birth to her without knowing a hundred percent. she's now 3 years old and perfectly fine no sign of Down syndrome whatsoever a  arod2782 @AnnelXo  Thank you!!!!!!!! m  meena1215 @arod2782  I think you should ask about non-invasive testing. I don't think that cvs or amnio is a must at this point. It's your choice about what to do next. You can also wait for the 18-20 week anatomy US. Don't stress though! It could be a mistake. j  jellybaby85 I did amnio in my last pregnancy and the procedure went fine... It's the only way to know with certainty that the baby does or doesn't have downs or another trisomy. Doing another test like harmony/ nipd or whatever it is will only give you another percentage risk... No definitive answer. For us, we had to know so having no wasn't even a decision we had to considers. If you feel you need to know too, cvs or amnio is the way to go. I'm not going to try give false hope because there is a chance baby could have a trisomy and as hard as it is, you need to be prepared for that possibility although I hope and pray that this is not the case for you. Thinking of you as I truly know how hard this situation is. Xx K  Kstewart1978 @arod2782  I am.... I'm freaking out and scared. The sono said thickened neck and the numbers are not in a normal range. I took the blood test and waiting before I decide the amnio. I can't think straight A  AvryanasMom I know it's hard but I honestly would try not to stress too much at this point... Only because I had to have that test repeated with my daughter (first pregnancy) because the ultrasound tech couldn't get a good measurement the first time because she was moving too much. Hope everything turns out ok. h  hyperballad4 @arod2782  I found out yesterday that I was high risk as well but luckily I had paid to have the NIPT test as well and got them back and no DS. That test is 99% accurate. I would recommend it if you can get it. You still have a 75% chance everything will work out, so keep hope alive, those are good odds. Congrats! B  BEE999 @arod2782  Hello, I am 28 and also received a positive screening (1 in 71). Apparently my papp-a was very low. I have an appt with a genetic counselor next week. I really hope I dont have to do the amnio. U should also talk with a genetic counselor before doing anything. A  ACH271988 I know someone that was told their daughter would be born with Downs and she was born completely normal. I know it's horrible news but that baby will be a blessing to you. a  arod2782 @jellybaby85  Yes I want to know for sure bc As hard as it will be My husband and I agreed on not continuing with the pregnancy. But there's also a chance if miscarriage but I'm doomed either way. No easy way out for this one. So devastating. a  arod2782 @Kstewart1978  Why didn't they have the blood work with your NT? They should've told you when they had both results. How high were your numbers? You're not alone. How far along are you? Bc you can do the cvs up to 13 weeks 6days. a  arod2782 @hyperballad4  But isn't the NIPT a screening just like the NT? I don't want another screening for risk factor I want a diagnostic to be sure that either there is or isn't Down syndrome. a  ababystory2 @arod2782  Try not to worry too much! You still have a 3 in 4 chance of having a normal child. And while we all want the healthiest baby possible, there will be nothing "wrong" if you have a downs kiddo. He/she would simply be different! Downs kids are so precious and sweet. Every child is beautiful in their own way. :) N  NicoleColbert @arod2782  Even if your baby is born with downs, it's a journey. They are amazing and sweet children. We personally wouldn't bat an eye lash over having a baby with downs. a  acidowly @arod2782  There's always hope! but if your child has downs I know you won't love him/her any less :) kids with downs are the sweetest most compassionate kids, and although they have hard time with something's, they are amazing at others. I know a girl who has downs and in high school kids would make fun of her, and one day she told the kids off. Now she's a life guard because she's an amazing swimmer! So even if your baby does has downs look at it as a blessing because you were blessed with a miracle either way :) Related Articles & Discussions 4 Ways the GOP Tax Plan Could Hurt Families  The tax plan provides short-term relief for most families — but long-term pain.

If you're able to find it, you'll see a lot of feedback I got from others. I was also told on Saturday that I'm high risk for a Down syndrome baby. It caught me completely off guard as I was thinking I was fine because I am 29. My readings came back as a 1 out of 228 chance. I'm still worried and waiting for my ultrasound on the 23rd where I find out baby's gender and where they'll be looking for markers that indicate Down syndrome.

We chose to have an amino done so that we can be prepared. We just moved from Chicago to a small town in Michigan so if there was something wrong, I wanted to know what resources were available to us. My amino results came back last week and our girl is totally fine! False positives with these tests are a lot higher than they advertise. I'm also going to be donating part of my placenta to the lab so that they can analyze it to see what may have gone wrong. Anything I can do to help other women not have to go through this, is totally worth it to me. b  brandddyyyy @Lexi1031  Yours came back 99% positive for downs?? Wow!!

Just that they were 99% sure that the lab results indicated an extra chromosome. My husband and I were devastated and we're so glad we did the amnio to get the diagnostic results. b  brandddyyyy @Lexi1031  Wow! I'm glad everything turned out alright! b  btterfli2003 I have a 1/43 ratio and I decided not to get an amino or placenta testing. I have been very stressed out about everything bc I really don't know what's going on. I was told I could have a level 2 ultrasound but not until 19 weeks. My doctor reminded me I could still get an abortion then which made me upset. Hopefully everything is Ok but this has turned my pregnancy into a very stressful situation when it should be the exact opposite. m  mouzamaz I have been told by the doctor that I got chance of 1/300 to have DS baby.. Is it a positive or negative ratio.. ? b  babythunberg @kellycrosland1980  I'm 35 and a FTM. The first screening completed came back at 1/187 of DS. I freaked out! Until I did further research and found out that the test is a screening it is not based solely on your blood work. Your age has a high factor in the results. I had the next blood panel test completed. The results came back perfectly fine. My baby does not have DS. I bet your baby is fine. It's your age putting you at a higher risk. s  superdee74 I had the CVS test done at 12 weeks. I was a little scared. They put a needle in my tummy to get a sample of my placenta. It didn't hurt and was a very fast procedure. We had the results within 7 days. We found out the results for close to 200 diseases including downs and cystic fibrosis. The results came back negative. I am 41 and high risk so we chose to by pass the blood screening and do this test. We wanted to know early so instead of being surprised later in we could prepare ourselves for what was to come if there were any health problems. It wa totally worth it and I slept better at night. I would recommend any mommy to bo to do this test just for peace of mind. Praying for healthy babies for all of us! :) B  Babydoll72 I did screening as well since i am 43. I was shocked to hear it was all low risk. What i have heard alot though, is there is a lot of false positives. So might want to be prepared but take it with a grain of salt. Your quad screening can show alot more too. L  Littleflower1981 dear kelly - it must be stressful. I personally would have gone the amnio route, but I completely understand if you don't want to. Remember that these are "SCREENING" test and not DIAGNOSTIC (the amnio is diagnostic). Screening tests gives you a probability that the baby has down syndrome, they detect potential disease indicators. Diagnostic test is yes or no - they establish presence/absence of disease. So even if the test came out 1/107, it also comes with accuracy level (which depends on the test; panorama test is higher than the regular bloodwork) which means that this 1/107 results has also a probability (of about 20% (bloodwork) to 1% (panorama) depending on test) to be wrong. I wish you, your husband and your baby all the best. L  Littleflower1981 @Lexi1031  Yes! donate to science is SO important (I am a scientist). I will donate my blood cord - if everything goes well - for the exact reason. Do it, girls! do it! J  JazzyJac @mouzamaz  That depends on a lot of factors, most importantly your age. You should ask your doctor. L  Littleflower1981 @mouzamaz  you should ask your doctor for more explanation. The "normal" ratio depends on a lot of thing (so 1/300 could be normal for someone but high for someone else). my "base" ratio (i am 34 white healty) was about 1/380, and the panorama test came back with 1/10000 (which is just a way for them to say very unlikely). As I said before, these are screening tests which give a probability of syndrome, and they have an accuracy too. It can be hard to grasp the limit of these tests for people who are not handy with statistic (i work with statistic) so I understand why they generate confusion. But again, you should talk with your doctor and get more info about what your rate is compared to your base one. Say your "base" level is 1/500, it means that the test gave you a slightly slightly higher change of risk of having the syndrome, but if your "Base" level is 1/380 (to say, like mine) the tests basically confirmed your base level. Even if I got my panorama test euqal to 1/10000 there is still the very low probability that indeed has some syndrome. The only certain way to know is tru diagnostic test, like amnio. (hope it helps!) m  mrshuntfarms My co worker had a false positive as well, kind of ruined her pregnancy experience b/c of the unnecessary worry. We have chosen not to have the testing done. This baby was a gift from God in the beginning, it is still a gift even if it is wrapped in a way we didn't expect.  m  mouzamaz @Littleflower1981  Thank you very much for your help.. I will do so and meet my doctor soon.. :) thnx again m  mouzamaz @JazzyJac  Thank you for your reply .. I will consider the age also.. :) Related Articles & Discussions Study: New Preeclampsia Screening Might Be More Accurate  Recent research has found that a new method for screening preeclampsia is easy, safe — and more accurate at identifying moms-to-be who are at the greatest risk. s High risk for down syndrome?

During my first pregnancy my baby was diagnosed with down syndrome,which was shocking to me as I was only 23 at the time and I had honestly never even considered it as a possibility. I am now pregnant again and I am terrified that it could happen to me again. I am four weeks away from the nuchal translucency us and I can't stop replaying the moment I received my upsetting news and imagining it happening again. I was just hoping that maybe someone out there has been through what I have been through and can share some stories about their pregnancy following one with a genetic abnormality. Thanks.

M  Mom2NicoleandFaith @Jess3787  As long as the baby has trisomy 21 then it was just a fluck and it really is rare for you to have more then one. If the baby has translocation then that means the gene came from one of the parents. My daughter with DS was 9 when I got preg with Faith and I chose not to have any testing besides the US because Nicole was a surprise and I didn't want to worry through my preg with Faith if something showed up. Faith was born "normal". I was 29 when I had Nicole and was almost 39 when I had Faith so who knows about age. I would not worry about it happening again. It is like lightning striking the same place twice, very rare! Good luck! J  Jess3787 Thank you to the both of you for sharing your stories. Although I know there is no way to know what the future holds for me it makes me feel better to know that there are others out there who have experienced what I have. B  Bellebk Dont worry and be happy, it doesnt need to happen again... Im sure this time it will be ok, last year i lost a pregnancy at 9w due cromosomal problems, Im 13w now and confident that this one is a keeper... m  mrsmatt10808 @Jess3787   Hey! I have twins who both have Down syndrome. They have trisomy 21 and we were told by a geneticist that it is really just a fluke (and a HUGE blessing!) and that the likelihood of a repeat are slim. That said- your odds DO go up slightly if you have already had a child with DS but I know so many moms who have had 1 with DS and 2 or 3 more without it. Either way, your baby is perfect. Good luck, try to stay calm.  W  Walkie I'm pregnant with my 2nd, my first born has special needs. Suspected chromosomal abnormality. It plays in the back of my mind obviously but we're so excited to be having another baby it doesn't consume me which I honestly thought it would.

This one I've been told has downs. :( so I think to put your mind at ease, the odds are in your favor. L  Lovepeacemama @Jess3787  Have you consulted with the genetic specialist they will tell you your odds after the blood test and NT. I assume you didn't keep the first baby or you would have read in all the down syndrome books that your chance before your blood test and NT is 1% or 1 in 100 for another baby with DS. L  Lovepeacemama @mrsmatt10808  Twins with DS that is amazing! How old are they? I know a lady who has 7 kids and two have DS(not twins though)and she always says she hit the genetic jackpot :) m  mrsmatt10808 @Lovepeacemama  Casey and Connor are 22 month old miracle men! We have found out the odds of identicals who both have DS is 1 or 2 in 1 million pregnancies! We really did hit the genetic jackpot! J  Jess3787 I have been fully aware since the beginning that my chances of a second child with down syndrome is 1% however having gone through the diagnosis the first time I also know that statistics mean absolutely nothing. I prefer to hear real life stories. D  Daydreamz82 I had test results come back at saying I have a 1/200 chance of having a child with Down Syndrome (trisomy 21) I opted out of having a amneo done as the odds of miscarriage during the procedure was the same odds even though the hospital & genetic specialists were pushing for us to have it done to "find out 100%" or not. When we had an ultrasound done at 20 weeks it showed no markers, it does not mean we are in the clear.

I am 26 and pregnant with my first as well. I have a 1/80 chance of having a baby with Downs. I opted out of getting the amnio but that was because I didn't want the added risk put on my pregnancy even though it is very minimal. I just figure that no matter the outcome, I will love my little boy just the same. I know how stressful it is and I feel for you. Best of luck to you and your baby. T  Tonyandkim2011 @kelli1087  It could be a false positive. I was 27 with my last and I had a false negative. They said the downs test came put negative. They were soo wrong. My perfect little man has downs. I know it's scary. If you ever need to talk feel free to message me. Good luck hope everything is great. M  Mom2NicoleandFaith @kelli1087  I was 28 when I got preg the first time and my odds where 1:800. My beautiful daughter Nicole was born with DS. At 38 I got preg for my second time and my odds where 1:100 and my daughter Faith was born "normal". Don't look at the numbers to much. I am glad I did not know til she was born because there is so much miss information out there. If you have the amnio and find out that your little one has DS, first just breathe and then research but new info not old. There are still doctors out there that are not updated with the most recent info. Either way enjoy your preg and remember that your baby will be perfect to you. No matter what. I am here if you ever need to talk. -  @kelli1087  Hi know how scary it can be waiting for these things.  I had almost the same thing happen to me a fwe weeks ago, except I screened positive for neural tube defects.  My odds were much higher than yours (1 in 13).  I had the ultrasound and they were able to rule out the NTD.  Yes, they offered me amnio as well, but it only gives us another 1-2% for certain, so we opted out.  It was my bloodwork that threw off the results (the fetal medicine specialist gave me 5 possible reasons!!).  There are so many things that can throw off the blood screening results.  You also need to remember (I know it's hard) that this is merely a "screening" and that your result says you only have a "higher than expected" chance.  Your odds of having a "normal" baby are still like 98-99% given your 1/67 guess.  Also, I have worked with a number of children with Downs - they are lovely, caring, affectionate kids, highly dependent on routine.  And despite previous thought, they are extremely capable and intelligent if early intervention is given.  Remember, you have a much higher chance of delivering a healthy "normal" baby than not, but it's never easy to sit and wait for an answer.  Try to relax and know that there is nothing you can/can't do right now.  I'm thinking of you and hoping you get the results you're looking for soon. k  kelli1087 @mmm_lovett2053478892  Thank you! Â That made me feel better! B  Battlestar @kelli1087  I have friends with DS children. Most children with downs have parents under the age of 25. They love their cuties and their other children are fine. But what a stress. I hope that everything works out and wish you the best of luck. b  babycaper @kelli1087  Well we have a heart defect and it could have been downs or digeorge syndrome, so we opted for the amnio.  I hated the feeling of it!  I had no idea what it would feel like.. so if you want to know read on, otherwise don't :) The first skin *** was just like a blood test, but when they punctured the sac it was a little burning/stinging sensation, but only mildly hurt for the second it punctured.  I was pretty sore right after and for the next day or so.. as if I had a big abs workout and the muscles were sore.  Hubby helped a lot by pulling me up and you shouldn't really carry anything heavy.  I didn't have any complications with it.. Good luck with the testing!  Really the waiting is the worst part.. it took us 3 days to get the down's results and 3 weeks to get the digeorge D  Dutunka @kelli1087   Hi, I had similar results to yours few weeks ago. after quad screen I got 1:50 chance for Downs. I was crying, and crying and crying... I wasn't sure why it happened with me. I'm 28. My OB sent me to genetic counseling, I decided to do amnio without any doubt, because the risk of having baby with Downs was higher than miscarriage after amnio. From my personal experience my amnio was easy, I didn't feel practically anything. The waiting is the worst. I declined to get FISH results as I needed to know final and accurate results. I got them on September 22nd and they told me everything is fine, no Downs or any of trisomy problems or neural defects. I went through anatomy u/s a week after, and everything seems to be fine also. If you want to know for sure and have some piece of mind - I suggest you to go through amnio. But it is really your own decision. For me it was out of the question, I wanted to do amnio no matter what, I would do it even if the odds were 1:100, it's just the person I am, I need to know for sure. They told me that amnio is about 99 % accurate, my OB actually told me 100 %. So I'm praying for healthy baby. We didn't want to find out the sex of the baby, it's a surprise. Good luck to you !  k  kelli1087 @Dutunka  I'm so happy for you. Â No one should have to go through their whole pregnancy not knowing for sure. Â I couldn't imagine having to deal with what I have been over that last week for the rest of my pregnancy! Â Your post really made me feel a lot more at ease with all of this. Â Thank you soo much!! Â I go in tomorrow to get my second u/s and genetic counseling. Â So I hope that brings a little more reassurance until the amnio. Â Also you said that you didn't get the FISH results done. Â Are they not as accurate as the amnio results? a  alexfoodie @kelli1087  Fish are accurate but do not test for everything. However, every lab is different in what they offer/ timeframes. I had a cvs at 12.5 weeks and the fish tested for 21, 13 and 18 while the full tested the remainder of the chromosomes. I had an amnio last year which the fish confirmed 13 and the full only reconfirmed the littany of problems. Good luck! D  Dutunka @kelli1087  The reason I dodn't want to get FISH results is because I've been told by genetic counselor that there were cases that final results and FISH did not match. It doesn't happen very often, but it is possible though. So i thought... "What the heck ? Why should I worry twice?" I'd rather wait two weeks, but get final and accurate results. And I waited exactly 2 weeks and 1 day. it was a nightmare believe me, a lot of sleepless nights for me. But, thanks God, everything came back fine. I'm still suspicious though and probably will be until Valentine's Day (it's when my baby is due), but I think it's normal for every Mom to be. But not as worried though as I was before I didn't know the results of the tests. I wish you all the luck and believe with all my heart that you will get great news too ! k  kelli1087 @Dutunka  I went for my level 2 u/s and genetic counseling today. Â I think it went well. Â The doctor came in and told me that there were no markers for DS and that he strongly believed my baby is 100% healthy. Â He changed my 1/67 to about 1/140. Â This made me and my family a lot more at ease. Â However, just to make sure, i went ahead with the amnio. Â He said that the FISH results would come in tomorrow afternoon at the earliest and friday morning at the latest. Â I am still worried (less than before). Â I am currently just taking it easy and hoping for the best. Â This whole experience has made me really appreciate everything in my life. Â I have read a few stories from people saying that they also showed no markers on the level 2 u/s and their baby still ended up with DS. Â So we aren't in the clear just yet. Â But we are certainly feeling better than before. Â I  Imjme @kelli1087  Hi Kelli087- did you get your FISH results yet? If you find out that you are having a baby with down syndrome, please feel free to message me'. My 2 yr old has down syndrome. I will be happy to answer any questions you might have. I will tell you that he us such a joy. I made a canvass with his picture that says "you are my sonshine", and he is! :) k  kelli1087 @Imjme  Yes, we got the results back friday afternoon and everything was normal.  This past week has been the most stressful week of my life.  This is my first baby and I'm 22.  This whole experience has just made me so thankful for everything I have taken for granted in the past.  I have done so much research and read so many stories on the internet about down syndrome.  And I've realized this really can happen to anyone, no matter the age or background.  I know I would love my baby either way.  Any child is a gift.  I have been looking into volunteer work for disabled children and adults.  I really feel as though I should do something to help others.  And I know it shouldn't take something like this to happen for me to realize that.  The important thing is I have definitely opened my eyes to reality and want to give back.  I just want to thank everyone for all the comforting stories and advice they have given to me over this past week.  Thank you! T  Tonyandkim2011 @Imjme  I just wanted to agree with you. My baby is 15 months with downs and he is the best thing that has ever happened to my family. I couldn't imagine life without him. We are so lucky so have such precious children in our lives. T  Tonyandkim2011 @kelli1087  I'm happy your results are great. Working with disabled children is a wonderful way to give back.

I am really glad that I did not have any clue that she would have it because I would have worried about so much and there has been alot of things that she has not had. So the only advice I can give you is to try and ease up on the worrying because you never know what will happen. Even if the amnio comes back positive, your baby is individual and can have a great life. Our daughter did not have any heart problems and she is in a regular school! Yes she does almost 50 percent of the time in a special ed class getting one on one help but she is included in everything. She does dance and girl scouts!!! So I hope I have help alittle and you can write me anytime if you have any questions. Good luck! R  Rosymom @shereem  Hi there. First, hugs to you!  I also had the quad screening and was given a 1:10 chance of downs and 1:30 chance of the other trisomy.  We chose not to have an amnio.  We would love this baby and keep this baby no matter what.  Our daughter was born 4 weeks ago and she is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!  No downs or not a thing wrong with her. We were scared too, and were fearful the entire pregnancy, but gave that to God. He gave us this baby and we knew that whatever happened was supposed to be.  My chances were worse than yours, and on the boards I never found anyone that had the chances I did. I hope this helps.  If you have anymore questions, let me know.  Or if I can help. B  BackforMore @shereem  Hi there. I know this is scary, but when you do the math, that's still only a 3% chance, which is pretty low! I have heard from lots of others whose tests were "positive" and yet the baby was completely fine at birth. I know you will worry, anyway, but everything will most likely be fine! Good luck and hugs to you. m  mrs_gtyjno1 @shereem  Hello, First of all, don't let the numbers scare you 1/32 is only 3%... and even for a mother aged 49 the odds only go up to 1/12 which is only an 8% chance of DS. The facts are that the odds are much higher in your favor that the baby will be normal. So, don't let the screenings and tests scare you. If the weatherman told you there was an 3 to 8% chance of rain, you probably wouldn't take your umbrella, right? Now, that isn't to say it isn't possible... but worry won't help you or the baby... plus, amnio is not without its risks. IF there is a problem.. do you want to add stress by worrying about the complications from amnio? There is a 2% chance of miscarriage too... which is about the same as your odds for DS (though at your age, it is still HIGHLY unlikely). There is also the risk of premature labor, infection, and a contaminated specimen. A lot of OBs and specialists don't mention how many amnios they have to repeat or get false results from either.... but there is potential for contamination of the fluid with too many of the mother's cells also. Basically in an amnio the fluid is composed of cells from the baby, the mother, the placenta.. most dead.. but they HOPE for enough living cells to centrifuge and then test. Many times they can collect enough information to ease a mother's fears, but sometimes they cannot. The best use for amnio is near the end of pregnancy if trying to determine lung maturity in case of an early delivery... then, if complications ensue, the baby is nearer term and safer, especially if it triggers labor (which it can do).  Any time an amnio is done there is a risk of bleeding and infection also.. there is also a small risk that they can hurt the baby, if not guided carefully by ultrasound (in most high risk clinics they have eliminated this risk, but if the baby jerks suddenly the movement could still cause a mishap). Now, all that said... I was told with my 3rd child that I had a risk of a DS child.. in fact, they were pretty sure she was DS... but they did an ultrasound and couldn't find anything abnormal... and I refused the risks of  amnio and other invasive testing, knowing the screenings are not perfect... and just trusted and prayed.  She was perfectly healthy and is now my straight-A student  :-)  So... please don't let these tests take on too much weight and ruin the joy of your pregnancy. Even in the unlikely even that you have a child with DS... most cases are mild to moderate and because medical science understands a lot more than they did many years ago... average life expectancy is now about 70... and most have very happy, functional lives... Trust that if God blessed you at this point in your  life with a new special little one that He isn't going to put more on you or your family than you can handle... and has picked you as the perfect family for the little person chosen for you... there is a purpose for everything. Good luck, and God bless... whatever you decide... I wish you peace. W  Waitingforskim @shereem  Just curious, did you go ahead with the amnio? I'm in the same boat right now. 1:43. S  Swanmom8 I also have a child with DS and I thank god that I passed all the screening tests and did not find out until birth. I would have worried so much and it would have ruined my pregnancy. She is almost 6 years old and attends the same school as her siblings. I couldn't imagine life without her!This pregnancy, I did the nt scan and ultrasounds and everything looks great so I am going to assume everything is fine and enjoy my pregnancy. I personally handle things better if I don't have any knowledge of something bad ahead of time. Otherwise, I would worry too much!!!It is a decision that you have to make about whether you want to relax and accept your baby as is or do you need to know ahead of time if something is wrong so as to prepare mentally. Good luck with your decision!!!Julie L  LanhamBaby1 @shereem  This is probably one of the best mssgs i have read since i joined. In fact, it almost made me cry. I have just turned 39 and my husband is 45..and we have feared the same. But after reading all the mssgs we've decided not to do any of the tests, except for the amnio. After reading your mssg, i'm not sure if i wanna do that either. But we are one of the cpls that decided if something was wrong, we wld abort. We just feel life is too hard for those of us who are healthy, or close to it..and it wld be so much harder on a child w/issues. I believe in God very much and i pray every day. I will pray that God helps us make the right decision and watches over our unborn child, as it grows. We are 9wks today, 1st sono on Mon. I can't wait, this is his first and i'm anxious to watch him experience it all. Thank you so much for everything you said. :) S  Swanmom8 I just want to add that I have never had a day that I regret that I had my dd with DS. But I would have 100% had regret if I had terminated a baby. We spent the day at a park with a lake today. My dd with DS always makes lots of friends and we had a young couple come up to us and hang out with us just to be with Emma. The young man's (23) brother has DS (24) and kept telling us how smart his brother was and you could tell he adored him. His girlfriend was telling us she is going to school to work with special education students. My dd with DS does what all other kids do at the beach...swim, make sandcastles, play with kids. We don't have to make any special accommodations for her as she is very independent and just like any of our other 7 kids. I think that we all remember the kids with DS from our childhood who weren't treated as equals or educated with typical kids. It makes a big difference!Just wanted to share a little more about a child with DS!!! Julie K  KristaRee @shereem  I was in your place last fall. We decided that it did not matter if he had DS or not, it was not going to change anything for us so we did not do the amnio. He turned out fine and healthy. So you have to decide if it is worth worrying over. We deicded the stress of it was not worth it for us and those tests are not always accurate. Good luck to you s  shereem @Waitingforskim  Hi! Yes.. I went ahead with the amnio. We decided that we wanted to know just to be prepared. And I am glad we did. I am happy and grateful to say that we have a perfectly healthy 15 month old baby boy. But getting the amnio was a hard decision to make.. but I am glad that I was able to enjoy the rest of my pregnancy worry free. Good luck to you. I am sure you will make the right decision for you and your family. <3 s  shereem @LanhamBaby1  First of all... Congrats on your pregnancy! I decided to go ahead with the amnio and the results all came back fine. We now have a beautiful 15 month old baby boy. Its a hard decision to make, I know. Â But afterwards I was able to enjoy the rest of my pregnancy. Have you had any tests yet? Good luck with your pregnancy and I am sure you will make the decision that is right for you and your family. :) W  Waitingforskim @shereem  Thanks so much for your reply and Congrats on your happy healthy baby boy!!!! We've decided to schedule the amnio. I think in the long run it's just the best choice for us as I'd be so worried and stressed out for the remainder of the pregnancy if I didn't get an answer. Either way it will help me relax/prepare before the baby comes. l  lavenderrose @BackforMore  your reply was helpful. thanks for sharing. l  lavenderrose @BackforMore  your reply was helpful. thanks for sharing. l  lavenderrose @Swanmom8  your reply was helpful. thanks for sharing.

Half the chromosomes come from the egg (the mother) and half come from the sperm (the father). This XY chromosome pair includes the X chromosome from the egg and the Y chromosome from the sperm. In Down syndrome, there is an additional copy of chromosome 21, resulting in three copies instead of the normal two copies.     Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome.  Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals, causing lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays. It's the most common genetic chromosomal disorder and cause of learning disabilities in children. It also commonly causes other medical abnormalities, including heart and gastrointestinal disorders.  Better understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly increase the quality of life for children and adults with this disorder and help them live fulfilling lives.      Symptoms Each person with Down syndrome is an individual — intellectual and developmental problems may be mild, moderate or severe. Some people are healthy while others have significant health problems such as serious heart defects.  Children and adults with Down syndrome have distinct facial features. Though not all people with Down syndrome have the same features, some of the more common features include:   Flattened face  Small head  Short neck  Protruding tongue  Upward slanting eye lids (palpebral fissures)  Unusually shaped or small ears  Poor muscle tone  Broad, short hands with a single crease in the palm  Relatively short fingers and small hands and feet  Excessive flexibility  Tiny white spots on the colored part (iris) of the eye called Brushfield's spots  Short height   Infants with Down syndrome may be average size, but typically they grow slowly and remain shorter than other children the same age.  Intellectual disabilities Most children with Down syndrome have mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Language is delayed, and both short and long-term memory is affected.  When to see a doctor Children with Down syndrome usually are diagnosed before or at birth. However, if you have any questions regarding your pregnancy or your child's growth and development, talk with your doctor.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from your father, the other from your mother.  Down syndrome results when abnormal cell division involving chromosome 21 occurs. These cell division abnormalities result in an extra partial or full chromosome 21. This extra genetic material is responsible for the characteristic features and developmental problems of Down syndrome. Any one of three genetic variations can cause Down syndrome:   Trisomy 21. About 95 percent of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 — the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies, in all cells. This is caused by abnormal cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell.  Mosaic Down syndrome. In this rare form of Down syndrome, a person has only some cells with an extra copy of chromosome 21. This mosaic of normal and abnormal cells is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization.  Translocation Down syndrome. Down syndrome can also occur when a portion of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) onto another chromosome, before or at conception. These children have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, but they also have additional genetic material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome.   There are no known behavioral or environmental factors that cause Down syndrome.  Is it inherited? Most of the time, Down syndrome isn't inherited. It's caused by a mistake in cell division during early development of the fetus.  Translocation Down syndrome can be passed from parent to child. However, only about 3 to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome have translocation and only some of them inherited it from one of their parents.  When balanced translocations are inherited, the mother or father has some rearranged genetic material from chromosome 21 on another chromosome, but no extra genetic material. This means he or she has no signs or symptoms of Down syndrome, but can pass an unbalanced translocation on to children, causing Down syndrome in the children.  Risk factors Some parents have a greater risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. Risk factors include:   Advancing maternal age. A woman's chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome increase with age because older eggs have a greater risk of improper chromosome division. A woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down syndrome increases after 35 years of age. However, most children with Down syndrome are born to women under age 35 because younger women have far more babies.  Being carriers of the genetic translocation for Down syndrome. Both men and women can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children.  Having had one child with Down syndrome. Parents who have one child with Down syndrome and parents who have a translocation themselves are at an increased risk of having another child with Down syndrome. A genetic counselor can help parents assess the risk of having a second child with Down syndrome.   Complications People with Down syndrome can have a variety of complications, some of which become more prominent as they get older. These complications can include:   Heart defects. About half the children with Down syndrome are born with some type of congenital heart defect. These heart problems can be life-threatening and may require surgery in early infancy.  Gastrointestinal (GI) defects. GI abnormalities occur in some children with Down syndrome and may include abnormalities of the intestines, esophagus, trachea and anus. The risk of developing digestive problems, such as GI blockage, heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux) or celiac disease, may be increased.  Immune disorders. Because of abnormalities in their immune systems, people with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, some forms of cancer, and infectious diseases, such as pneumonia.  Sleep apnea. Because of soft tissue and skeletal changes that lead to the obstruction of their airways, children and adults with Down syndrome are at greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea.  Obesity. People with Down syndrome have a greater tendency to be obese compared with the general population.  Spinal problems. Some people with Down syndrome may have a misalignment of the top two vertebrae in the neck (atlantoaxial instability). This condition puts them at risk of serious injury to the spinal cord from overextension of the neck.  Leukemia. Young children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of leukemia.  Dementia. People with Down syndrome have a greatly increased risk of dementia — signs and symptoms may begin around age 50. Having Down syndrome also increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.  Other problems. Down syndrome may also be associated with other health conditions, including endocrine problems, dental problems, seizures, ear infections, and hearing and vision problems.   For people with Down syndrome, getting routine medical care and treating issues when needed can help with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  Life expectancy Life spans have increased dramatically for people with Down syndrome. Today, someone with Down syndrome can expect to live more than 60 years, depending on the severity of health problems.  Prevention There's no way to prevent Down syndrome. If you're at high risk of having a child with Down syndrome or you already have one child with Down syndrome, you may want to consult a genetic counselor before becoming pregnant.  A genetic counselor can help you understand your chances of having a child with Down syndrome. He or she can also explain the prenatal tests that are available and help explain the pros and cons of testing.

Extra or Missing Chromosomes          Back to Extra or Missing Chromosomes           English   Español       How do you calculate the risks of having a child with Trisomy 21 if the mother is 44 years old, the father is 46 years old and there has already been one miscarriage due to Trisomy 21?        -A curious adult from the U.S.   June 4, 2014  Two of the three factors you’ve mentioned are important for figuring out the risk for having a child with Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome.  The one that doesn’t play a big role is the age of the dad.  Of the other two, the one that usually matters most is mom’s age.  As you can see in the chart below, a mom’s chance of having a child with Down syndrome gets higher as she gets older.    So, in most cases, a 44-year-old woman would have around a 3% chance of having a child with Down syndrome.  The flip side of that means she has a 97% chance of not having a child with Down syndrome.  The final risk factor is one that depends on why a couple had a child with Down syndrome in the first place.  Most cases of Down syndrome are the result of a mistake that happens when an egg or sperm gets made.  This just happens by random chance, so having one child with Down syndrome for this reason usually doesn’t really increase your chance for having a second.  There are a few cases though where Down syndrome is more common in a family for genetic reasons.  One of these is something called a translocation.  If mom has a translocation, then the chance to have a child with Down syndrome can go up to around 10-12%. If dad has the balanced translocation, then the chance is about 3%. A family can tell if this is the issue with a blood test on mom and dad that looks at their chromosomes.  So that is how to calculate the risks in this case.  Assuming there isn’t a balanced translocation, then the only big factor is mom’s age.  At 44, there is about a 3% chance for her child to have Down syndrome.  Now I want to talk a little bit about why as a woman gets older her chances for a child with Down syndrome increase. Then we will talk about the type of Down syndrome that can “run in a family.”   The Problem with Older Eggs  We can’t talk about Down syndrome without talking about chromosomes. You might remember that chromosomes are the packages of instructions that are in every cell of our body.  They tell our bodies what to look like, how tall to grow, and how to function.  Humans usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes.  We get one of each pair passed down from mom and one of each pair from dad.  Sometimes, there is a random mistake when the sperm or egg is being made. This causes there to be extra or missing chromosomes passed down from that parent. If this happens with an extra copy of chromosome 21, it causes Down syndrome.  This happens by random chance, but this chance goes up as a woman gets older. This is because women are born with all of the eggs they are ever going to have and as a woman gets older, her eggs get older too.  So the older the egg is when it is getting ready to package only half of the chromosomes to pass down (one of each pair), the higher chance that a chromosome pair will get stuck together. This is what happens with Down syndrome, the chromosome 21 pair gets stuck together.  There is also a higher chance as women get older of the other chromosome pairs getting stuck together when they are getting packaged into an egg, but Down syndrome we see in pregnancies and babies that are born.  A mistake in packaging of chromosomes can happen with dad too, but the chances really don’t get higher as dad gets older. That is because men are constantly producing new sperm every couple of weeks, so there isn’t a higher chance that the chromosomes will get stuck together. But as you can see here , children of older dads are at a higher risk for a different set of conditions.  So if a couple has had a previous pregnancy with Down syndrome for this reason, then the chance of having a child with Down syndrome is usually low, about 1 in 100 or if she is 40 or above, whatever her chance is due to her age.   Balanced Translocations  Now that we talked about Down syndrome that just happens by random chance, let’s talk about Down syndrome that can “run in families.” This happens if Down syndrome is caused by a translocation. What that means is that one chromosome gets stuck to another chromosome.  About 4% of cases of Down syndrome are caused by something called a Robertsonian translocation, also known as Translocation Down syndrome. This can be random or inherited from a parent. This happens when the extra copy of chromosome 21 becomes attached to another chromosome. To learn more about how this happens, click here .  You can see an example where the extra copy of chromosome 21 is attached to the top of chromosome 14 in the image below:    Even though it is arranged differently, there are still three copies of chromosome 21 and this still causes Down syndrome.  To see if it was inherited, you have to see if one of the parents has a translocation as well. This can be done by a blood test on each parent.  If Down syndrome was inherited, one parent would have chromosomes that looked something like the picture below:    Here one copy of chromosome 21 is attached to chromosome 14, but there is only one other copy of chromosome 21. This is called a balanced translocation. The parent has the typical number of chromosomes just arranged in a different way so the translocation usually does not cause any health problems for the person.  The reason it can be helpful to know if Down syndrome was caused by a translocation is because it will change your risk. If a parent has a balanced translocation, the chance of passing down an extra chromosome to a child depends of which parent has the translocation. There is about a 3% chance for Down syndrome to happen again if dad has the translocation and about a 10-12% chance if mom has the translocation. To find out more about these numbers, click here .  So the most likely scenario is that Down syndrome in your previous pregnancy was random and not the type that is inherited. If this is true, the chance of having a child with Down syndrome would be around 3%, and a 97% chance of not having a child with Down syndrome.

The chromosomes are arranged in pairs and this is what they look like under a microscope. A has the usual 46 chromosomes while B has an extra chromosome 21 as indicated by the red circle.  The most common way for someone to end up with Down syndrome is if mom's egg has an etra chromosome 21.

Are You at Risk of Having a Baby With Down Syndrome?  Doctors describe some of the known risk factors for having a child with Down syndrome. By Virginia Sole-Smith  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Leah Warkentin/Design Pics/Corbis  Although researchers have pinpointed how Down syndrome occurs, they still don't know very much about why it happens. This can make it difficult to understand whether you are at risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. "There have been theories about whether it's due to how well the mother metabolizes folate, but there are just as many studies saying no as studies saying yes," explains Kenneth Rosenbaum, M.D., founder of the division of genetics and metabolism and co-director of the Down Syndrome Clinic at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. "For the most part, we simply don't understand this as well as we would like," he says. Down syndrome is a condition that happens when a baby is conceived with a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. In about 3 percent to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome, there are two full 21st chromosomes and a partial extra chromosome 21 stuck to a different chromosome altogether, the result of a process called translocation. Down syndrome occurs all around the world, in people of every race and economic background. And although it is a genetic condition, you most likely will not have any family history. "In most cases, the extra chromosome seems to happen by chance," says Emily Jean Davidson, M.D., clinical director of the Down Syndrome Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Down syndrome can occur at any maternal age, but the possibility increases as a woman gets older. That said, if you have one child with Down syndrome, your chance of having a second child with the condition is about 1 percent for a mother over 40. If your baby has a translocation, physicians will suggest checking both parents' chromosomes to see if the translocation arose in the baby (most commonly the case) or if either parent is a carrier. If so, genetic testing can pinpoint the cause and determine your individual chance of recurrence. But there is one key risk factor for Down syndrome: maternal age. A 25-year-old woman has a 1 in 1,200 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome; by 35, the risk has increased to 1 in 350; by age 40, to 1 in 100; and by 49, it's 1 in 10, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. If you are over 35 and thinking about getting pregnant, you and your partner may want to undergo genetic counseling to more precisely pinpoint your risk. Regardless of your age, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that all pregnant women should be offered prenatal genetic screening for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. During weeks 11 to 14 of your pregnancy, a blood test combined with an ultrasound (which checks the thickness at the back of the fetus's neck, known as its nuchal translucency) can detect Down syndrome in 82 to 87 percent of cases, with minimal risk to you or your baby. If you are over 35 or have other known risk factors, your doctor may also suggest a fetal DNA test (sold commercially as MaterniT21 or Harmony) during the first trimester; it has a 99 percent accuracy rate because it works by sequencing the small pieces of your baby's DNA that circulates in your bloodstream during pregnancy. In your second trimester, another blood test, known as the multiple marker screening, or quad screening (because it checks the level of four different substances in your blood) can detect Down syndrome with 80 percent accuracy. If any of these screening tests raise a red flag, you can have a diagnostic test such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), though these procedures do carry a small risk of miscarriage. Deciding whether to be screened, and which tests to have, is a personal choice: "Some women feel that the more information they have, the better they can prepare themselves, or they may make some tough decisions," says Dr. Davidson, noting that diagnosing Down syndrome in utero does help doctors know to keep close tabs on whether your baby has any potentially life-threatening related issues, such as congenital heart disease. "But some families decline being screened because they feel the information wouldn't change the course of their pregnancy." Keep track of your medical records with this printable list of prenatal tests No matter what your risk, remember that Down syndrome occurs before conception: "Nothing you do during your pregnancy will increase your risk or reverse what has already happened," Dr. Rosenbaum says. "All you can do while pregnant is take the best possible care of yourself and your baby by eating well, taking prenatal vitamins, and following other common sense advice."

Read below for recent statistics on Down syndrome in the United States.  Occurrence of Down syndrome in the United States  Babies:   Down syndrome continues to be the most common chromosomal disorder. Each year, about 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome, which is about 1 in every 700 babies born. [ Read summary ]  Between 1979 and 2003, the number of babies born with Down syndrome increased by about 30%. [ Read summary ]  Older mothers are more likely to have a baby affected by Down syndrome than younger mothers. In other words, the prevalence of Down syndrome increases as the mother’s age increases. Prevalence is an estimate of how often a condition occurs among a certain group of people. To estimate the prevalence of Down syndrome, the number of pregnancies affected by Down syndrome is compared to the total number of live births. [ Read summary ]    Children and Adults:   In 2002, about 1 out of every 1,000 children and teenagers (0 to 19 years old) living in the United States had Down syndrome. This means that in 2002 about 83,000 children and teenagers were living with Down syndrome. [ Read summary ]  Researchers estimated that in 2008 about 1 out of every 1,200 people (children, teens, and adults) living in the United States had Down syndrome. This means that in 2008 about 250,700 children, teens, and adults were living with Down syndrome in the United States.[ Read summary ]   Down syndrome survival   The life expectancy of people with Down syndrome increased dramatically between 1960 and 2007. In 1960, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 10 years old. In 2007, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 47 years old. [ Read summary ]  Many factors can affect how long a person with Down syndrome lives.  Sometimes infants with Down syndrome are born weighing less than 1,500 grams, or about 3.3 pounds. This is called “very low birth weight.” These babies are 24 times more likely to die in the first 28 days of life compared to infants with Down syndrome of normal birth weight (between 2,500 grams and 4,000 grams, or between 5.5 and 8.8 pounds). [ Read summary ]  Black or African-American infants with Down syndrome have a lower chance of surviving beyond the first year of life compared with white infants with Down syndrome. More research is needed to help understand why. [ Read summary ]  Infants with Down syndrome who also had a congenital heart defect (CHD) were five times more likely to die in the first year of life compared to infants with Down syndrome who did not have a CHD. [ Read summary ]    Between 1983 and 2003, about 93% of babies born with Down syndrome survived to one year of age. In the same time period, about 88% of babies born with Down syndrome survived to 20 years of age. [ Read summary ]  The number of infants with Down syndrome that die before one year of age has declined over time. For example, between 1979 and 2003, among babies with Down syndrome, the rate of death during the first year of life declined from 8.5% to 5.0%, a decrease of about 41%. For comparison, the rate of death during the first year of life among all babies in the general population declined from 1.5% during 1979-1983 to 0.9% during 1999-2003, a decrease of about 40%. [ Read summary ]   Disabilities and added risks   About 50% of all babies born with Down syndrome are also born with a congenital heart defect . Babies with Down syndrome can be affected by a wide variety of heart defects. Many of these conditions will need surgery, while some milder heart defects might go away on their own as the child grows and may only need to be monitored by a healthcare provider. [ Read summary ]  Compared to children without Down syndrome, children with Down syndrome are at higher risk for:  Hearing loss (up to 75% may be affected)  Obstructive sleep apnea, a condition where a person’s breathing temporarily stops while asleep (between 50 -75%)  Ear infections (between 50 -70% may be affected)  Eye diseases, like cataracts (up to 60%)  Eye issues requiring glasses (50%)  Heart defects present at birth (50%)  Intestinal blockage at birth requiring surgery (12%)  Hip dislocation (when the thigh bone slips out of the hip socket) (6%)  Thyroid disease (a problem with metabolism) (4-18%)  Anemia (red blood cells can’t carry enough oxygen to the body) (3%)  Iron deficiency anemia (red blood cells don’t have enough iron to carry oxygen to the body) (10%)  Leukemia (1%) in infancy or early childhood  Hirschsprung disease (an illness of the gut that can cause constipation) (<1%)This article includes the American Academy of Pediatrics Health Supervision for children with Down syndrome from 2011. [ Read summary ]  For more health care information for families of children with Down syndrome    Older adults with Down syndrome have increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. [ Read summary ]   Health care, costs, and other related topics   Among children aged 0-4 years with private insurance, average medical care costs were 12 times higher for children with Down syndrome compared to children of the same age without Down syndrome. [ Read summary ]  For infants with Down syndrome, those born with a heart defect had, on average, health care costs that were five times higher in the first year of life than for infants with Down syndrome who did not have a heart defect. [ Read summary ]  A study used data from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Healthcare Needs (NSCSHN) to look at the effects of Down syndrome on families. Responses from the NSCSHN questionnaire indicated the following:  Nearly 60% of families of children with Down syndrome provided health care at home. Health care included practices such as changing bandages, care of feeding or breathing equipment, and giving medication and therapies.  Over 40% of families of children with Down syndrome had a family member who stopped working because of the child’s condition.  About 40% reported the child’s condition caused financial problems.

Author information 1 Interfaith Medical Center, Division of Cytogenetics, Brooklyn, New York 11238. Abstract In a sample of 75 children with trisomy for chromosome 21, or Down syndrome, there were 42 males and 33 females. The sex ratio was 1.30 which is statistically not significant (p greater than 0.05). However, a similar sex ratio (1.36) was reported in a larger sample size which was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). This discrepancy was due to the size of the samples. The two studies suggested an excess of males in the referred population. The decreasing age of mothers of infants with Down syndrome was also evident. Furthermore, more, more males with Down syndrome were born to young couples (age less than 35 years) while elderly couples had an excess of girls.

Are You at Risk of Having a Baby With Down Syndrome?  Doctors describe some of the known risk factors for having a child with Down syndrome. By Virginia Sole-Smith  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Leah Warkentin/Design Pics/Corbis  Although researchers have pinpointed how Down syndrome occurs, they still don't know very much about why it happens. This can make it difficult to understand whether you are at risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. "There have been theories about whether it's due to how well the mother metabolizes folate, but there are just as many studies saying no as studies saying yes," explains Kenneth Rosenbaum, M.D., founder of the division of genetics and metabolism and co-director of the Down Syndrome Clinic at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. "For the most part, we simply don't understand this as well as we would like," he says. Down syndrome is a condition that happens when a baby is conceived with a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. In about 3 percent to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome, there are two full 21st chromosomes and a partial extra chromosome 21 stuck to a different chromosome altogether, the result of a process called translocation. Down syndrome occurs all around the world, in people of every race and economic background. And although it is a genetic condition, you most likely will not have any family history. "In most cases, the extra chromosome seems to happen by chance," says Emily Jean Davidson, M.D., clinical director of the Down Syndrome Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Down syndrome can occur at any maternal age, but the possibility increases as a woman gets older. That said, if you have one child with Down syndrome, your chance of having a second child with the condition is about 1 percent for a mother over 40. If your baby has a translocation, physicians will suggest checking both parents' chromosomes to see if the translocation arose in the baby (most commonly the case) or if either parent is a carrier. If so, genetic testing can pinpoint the cause and determine your individual chance of recurrence. But there is one key risk factor for Down syndrome: maternal age. A 25-year-old woman has a 1 in 1,200 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome; by 35, the risk has increased to 1 in 350; by age 40, to 1 in 100; and by 49, it's 1 in 10, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. If you are over 35 and thinking about getting pregnant, you and your partner may want to undergo genetic counseling to more precisely pinpoint your risk. Regardless of your age, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that all pregnant women should be offered prenatal genetic screening for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. During weeks 11 to 14 of your pregnancy, a blood test combined with an ultrasound (which checks the thickness at the back of the fetus's neck, known as its nuchal translucency) can detect Down syndrome in 82 to 87 percent of cases, with minimal risk to you or your baby. If you are over 35 or have other known risk factors, your doctor may also suggest a fetal DNA test (sold commercially as MaterniT21 or Harmony) during the first trimester; it has a 99 percent accuracy rate because it works by sequencing the small pieces of your baby's DNA that circulates in your bloodstream during pregnancy. In your second trimester, another blood test, known as the multiple marker screening, or quad screening (because it checks the level of four different substances in your blood) can detect Down syndrome with 80 percent accuracy. If any of these screening tests raise a red flag, you can have a diagnostic test such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), though these procedures do carry a small risk of miscarriage. Deciding whether to be screened, and which tests to have, is a personal choice: "Some women feel that the more information they have, the better they can prepare themselves, or they may make some tough decisions," says Dr. Davidson, noting that diagnosing Down syndrome in utero does help doctors know to keep close tabs on whether your baby has any potentially life-threatening related issues, such as congenital heart disease. "But some families decline being screened because they feel the information wouldn't change the course of their pregnancy." Keep track of your medical records with this printable list of prenatal tests No matter what your risk, remember that Down syndrome occurs before conception: "Nothing you do during your pregnancy will increase your risk or reverse what has already happened," Dr. Rosenbaum says. "All you can do while pregnant is take the best possible care of yourself and your baby by eating well, taking prenatal vitamins, and following other common sense advice."

Mark Leach  May 2, 2013  What are the odds that you are having a child with Down syndrome?  Here in my hometown, it’s Derby week. With the greatest two minutes in sports upon us, it naturally has me thinking about odds. Indeed, prenatal testing for Down syndrome has that same focus. So, what are the odds that you are having a child with Down syndrome? Not only is this answer important, but it will surprise many.  It has long been known that the chance for having a child with Down syndrome increases with the age of the mother. See the graph at this post for the chance based on maternal age. While this relationship has been known, the reason for it remains unknown. Moreover, the most recent guidelines from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD) state that maternal age, alone, is not enough to rely upon for the chance of having a child with Down syndrome.  This is where prenatal screening comes in. Screening tests provide a reevaluation of the odds that a pregnancy is positive for Down syndrome. Initially these tests could only be provided in the second-trimester. Then, in 2007, professional guidelines recognized the nuchal translucency-combined test, which can be offered in the first trimester.  As an example of these type of screening tests, a mother who is 25-years old has a baseline chance of having a child with Down syndrome of about 1-in-1,250; if she were to receive a screen result for Down syndrome, then her odds may be readjusted to 1-in-250, or some other revision of her baseline chance for having a child with Down syndrome. But, these tests have been likened to “ tarot cards ” because they are imprecise, with false positives outweighing the number of pregnancies with Down syndrome that the screening tests actually detect.  As has been covered at length on this blog, now we have a new era of prenatal testing known as Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS). These tests essentially turn the odds of the previous screening tests on their head. Whereas under the “tarot cards” false positives outnumber true positives, that is not the case for NIPS; instead, a NIPS result for Down syndrome can mean the odds are that the pregnancy actually is positive for Down syndrome (when the mother is 30 years or older–see the graph at this post ).  But, as every professional statement and even the NIPS testing companies themselves have emphasized , a NIPS result is not enough to rely upon because there remain false positives and false negatives. Therefore, diagnostic testing is required to truly know whether you are having a child with Down syndrome and only an amniocentesis provides the most accurate results, since CVS testing can return the same false positive as NIPS.  But (and here’s the kicker), even a diagnostic test will not tell you your odds for having a child with Down syndrome.  Here’s why:  Odds are, you are not going to have a child with Down syndrome. There is no maternal age where the odds of having a child with Down syndrome exceed the chance of not having a child with Down syndrome. In fact, almost every pregnant woman in the world is not going to have a child with Down syndrome.  This is because the incidence of actually having a child with Down syndrome is very low. Of the 6 million pregnancies each year in the United States, there are at most 20,000 pregnancies that are actually carrying a child with Down syndrome. But, even for those pregnancies the odds are they are not going to have a child with Down syndrome .  How can this be?  Because most pregnancies positive for Down syndrome naturally miscarry. Reports vary on the percentages, but the ones that I’m familiar with state that 50% of pregnancies carrying a child with Down syndrome miscarry in the first trimester and 40% of those pregnancies that make it to the second trimester miscarry. This means, receiving a CVS result in the first trimester means the pregnancy has as much of a chance of miscarrying as continuing into the second trimester. Once the pregnancy is into the second trimester, when an amniocentesis can be performed, the odds of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome are still 6 out of 10.  So, the odds are that even with a diagnosis for Down syndrome, it does not mean that a child will be born with Down syndrome.  I wonder how often this actually is shared with expectant mothers considering prenatal testing. While it is discussed in recognized resources like “ Diagnosis to Delivery ,” for those mothers who choose to continue their pregnancy after a prenatal diagnosis, I wonder if it is shared with mothers considering termination?  It certainly would seem relevant that a woman considering an invasive medical procedure would be advised of the possible outcomes if the procedure were not performed. Considering that the whole exercise of prenatal testing is to determine the chance of having a child with Down syndrome, shouldn’t these odds also be shared?  Like this: Like  Loading...

We are 20 weeks into our pregnancy and just found out from the materniT21 test that our child has DS T21.  So I’m out hunting for information and found your blog referenced by a genetic technician. In the above you state, “Once the pregnancy is into the second trimester, when an amniocentesis can be performed, the odds of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome are still 6 out of 10.” As we are in our 2nd trimester this is obviously very troubling and I want to understand what we are facing as we continue to carry.  So I thank you for your efforts and ask if you can point me to the source of the metrics you pointed to above?         Mark Leach  says:    July 24, 2014 at 12:21 pm     Abraham–a MaterniT21 test is never positive or negative completely for Down syndrome–there remain false positives and false negatives. To determine your wife’s chances of having a child with Down syndrome following a MaterniT21 test, it would involve applying her baseline chance based on her age with the stated accuracy rate for MaterniT21 (around 99.5% detertion/99.9% specificity). You can follow the analysis at this post or ask to meet with a genetic counselor who should be able to advise you.         rebekaH  says:    August 18, 2015 at 3:38 pm     my daughter tested positive for down syndrome im extremely happy that she had no such thing at birth at all shes smart and going in fifth grade now I almost got a abortion trusting results but felt so bad because I was far along so thank you jesus for this blessing oh I prayed hard I EVEN had a second child 14 monthes later and now 10 yrs later im pregnant again this time worried im 42,         Mark Leach  says:    August 18, 2015 at 4:32 pm     Rebekah, when you say your daughter tested “positive” for Down syndrome, I wonder if that was just a screening test. Given your current pregnancy, it is important to know that the only true “positive” is from diagnostic testing, which involves inserting a needle into the womb and removing a sample of the amniotic fluid. Unless you have that test (or a few other similarly invasive diagnostic tests), no other test is truly a “positive,” but just a recalculation of the chances of having a child with Down syndrome.           Deb  says:    March 15, 2016 at 1:09 pm     How are you doing now….w ith your downs baby?…We..have a two day old baby         Paula Jane Pieklo-Byler  says:    April 13, 2017 at 2:20 pm     My son has,downs. He is 32 on May 1. I was only 21 when I had him which back then was rare. I got him into infant stimulation classes at 2,months. I worked with him every day. Teachers said he could not learn to read but I taught him phonics and he can read anything! It is very important that you work with your child alot.  The school taught him signing but then he stopped talking. I did homemade flashcards to get him to talk. I labelled everything in the house to teach him to read, I got him fun reading programs for the computer. Now he cooks, is a good cook, and he can walk to the store on his own, get everything on my lidt, and use a debit card and type in the pin. He went to normal preschool through high school. He went to a career center that taught him to cook and do laundry, dishes etc.  We taught him the days of the week by singing the happy days theme song! Over and over and over. I have a daughter born 4 years after him that is exceptionally smart. Craig can do just about anything!             Keshet  says:    October 1, 2014 at 3:26 pm     I have tested positive for Down’s syndrome and have to further go on to have amniocentesis . I would like to know where you got your information as I believe you are severely misinformed. There are a lot of women diagnosed with carrying a child with Down’s syndrome . Unfortunately- these tests are alot more indicative of actual results rather than not. I think you need to be doing more research prior to writing about something you are not entirely educated in.         Mark Leach  says:    October 1, 2014 at 4:17 pm     Please see the further research I have done on this issue at the post at this link . Read to the end and read the two other posts linked there. Also, feel free to share your amnio results as I would be curious if they confirm the screening test result or contradict the screen result.         Rachel  says:    May 10, 2016 at 12:33 am     I had a screening done when I was 22 years old, pregnant with first child, and they said I tested positive, had the amino, and my daughter is perfectly healthy. Even the doctors say the screening is not accurate.             Anonymous Person  says:    November 16, 2014 at 9:41 pm     Having made the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy that was confirmed T21 after NT screen and subsequent amniocentesis, I completely disagree with the approach you seem to be taking.  I was informed of the percentages of miscarriage, etc. prior to the amniocentesis, and this information in fact, lead us to make the decision my husband and I came to.  With a 40% chance of miscarriage, and grave reservations regarding other co-morbid conditions associated with a downs diagnosis, it is imperative to arm women with this information.  For your comment regarding the Maternit21 test above, I believe its cruel of you to convey such a tone of hopefulness.  This test is incredibly accurate, and an positive result is a devastating blow to the expecting couple.  While you are correct it is not foolproof 100%, I’d urge you to consider your tone in speaking to couples facing what is truly a traumatic experience – the possibility of carrying a child that will die or face potentially overwhelming health issues through his or her life.  The tone of your article is quite insensitive — Especially for those 20,000 pregnancies each year facing these issues.  Who else  exactly do you think is searching for your article????         Mark Leach  says:    November 17, 2014 at 9:37 am     Thank you for sharing your experience. I try to be mindful that every woman makes her own decision. I just want those decisions, whatever they may be, are based on accurate information. Too often that does not happen.         lesley  says:    January 28, 2016 at 10:47 am     I am a parent of an amazing girl with down syndrome,i didnt have any tests i took it as she was a baby and my baby! I wouldnt change her for the world! I think to many people are scared of the unknown and assume down syndrome is this condition that means the child will not reach and milestones or achieve anything?? There is nothing to say you will give birth to a baby that goes on to have any number of life dibilitating problems none of which are chromosome related so i think some of the mums posted on here are giving out bad attitudes to other mums about testing and DS.  Please look at all the facts and check with other mums in your areas whi have down syndrome children just what life can be like, yes yiu might visit hospital a few more times yes it takes longer for them to learn but in a away you get to keep your baby for longer before they become terrible toddlers with tantrums. babies are born healthy in lots of different ways my girl is healthy she just has down syndrome it doesnt difine her shes just a girl x         Fawn  says:    September 13, 2016 at 1:46 pm     What a beautiful statement Lesley!  Yes, some babies are born with challenges, like with my last baby.  He was in the NICU for 3 months with many complications.  The doctors said we could “pull the plug” if we wanted to.  We said NO WAY!  Now he’s 3, and has lived a year longer than they expected and functioning in ways they said he never would!  Yes, he has limits, takes longer to learn a few things, but knowing his disability, he’s brilliant, and I wouldn’t change a single minute of our experiences with this truly amazing, sweet, wonderful little boy!  I appreciate Mark’s article, giving hope is something much more rare these days!  I think it’s wonderful that his research and the time he has taken to share his experience can bless the lives, and give a measure of peace and hope to families expecting a new arrival!           Paula Jane Pieklo-Byler  says:    April 13, 2017 at 2:29 pm     My son was born with downs 32 years ago. Tests can be inaccurate as other have said on here. Some had a down a diagnosis and had a normal child. My son has downs but is perfectly healthy. He is like any other child. Went to normal school graduates. What they tell you about downs babies is not true! My son walks to the store on his own, gets what’s on my list, pays with debit card, remembers the pin! He cooks for me every day. It only takes patience to teach them! He is such a blessing .           ANONYMOUS  says:    February 1, 2015 at 2:42 am     Just a short blup… I too was recently dx with a child having Down’s Syndrome (DS).  My Maternit21 test came back with a high positive percentage and my amniocentesis came back positive as well.  I know these tests are not 100%, but it allows the parents to make important decisions.  Medical professionals never gave me information about a DS child miscarrying in the 2nd trimester secondary to DS.  Therefore, the incidents of a pregnancy and DS should be assessed on a case to case basis.  NOTE:  Not all DS children are dx in utero, the screenings and ultrasounds can come back negative for abnormalities as well.  Again, each pregnancy is different.         Mark Leach  says:    February 1, 2015 at 12:17 pm     Thank you for sharing your experience. You are correct that each pregnancy is unique and should be treated that way. With having a prenatal diagnosis, feel free to review the resources at the Prenatal Resources tab, which are recommended by professional guidelines, particularly if they weren’t provided to you. I hope you find them helpful.           kimberly  says:    July 21, 2015 at 6:55 am     I just foind out I am expecting ny fourth child and I am scared because my youngest has down syndrome and i love him dearly….im reading so much on here i dont get whether or not i will this child will be born with ds or not i am hoping for the best outcome and i believe i wouldnt be given anything i couldnt handle but theres so many thoughts running through my head… i will love the baby anyways In just so full of emotions and hopes that all is going to go well and i am 35 years old is this wrong of me?         Mark Leach  says:    July 21, 2015 at 2:02 pm     Kimberly: being a parent myself who had a child after our child with Down syndrome, I understand your concern. The rule of thumb is that once you’ve had a child with Down syndrome, your odds for having another child with Down syndrome are roughly 1:100. However, since you had your first child when you were under 35, according to the National Society of Genetic Counselors guidelines (see Table 1) on giving a diagnosis, your odds now are roughly 1:350. I would discuss these concerns further with your medical professional or genetic counselor, and if you’re connected with your local parent support organization, I expect they have staff members or volunteers who could also help you as well. I wish you a healthy and happy pregnancy.           Brona  says:    July 22, 2015 at 1:33 am     Hi, I was given a penta screen and it came back as 1 in 82 for having a child with Down syndrome. This is still only 1% chance right? I’m 25 and this is my second child, first was born healthy. I’m terrified and have elected to have an amniocentesis. Since this is not the materniti21 screening is it likely this is a false positive? I have been researching everything to do with this screening and it doesn’t seem scientifically accurate. It tests these substances in your blood but other things could effect these substances right; either lowering them or raising them.         Mark Leach  says:    July 22, 2015 at 8:40 am     Brona–you are correct. Penta is of the more traditional-style screening tests, which have higher false positives than cell free DNA tests like MaterniT21. With the Penta screen result, you would now be considered “high risk” and eligible for a covered cell free DNA test if in the United States. Many mothers with a high risk traditional screen result are opting to rely on the cell free DNA test result, particularly where it is screen-negative, to avoid the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis. However, if you wish to know for certain, an amnio will provide you that level of certainty. The Prenatal Resources tab has links for the recommended resources about Down syndrome for expectant mothers if you wish to learn more about the condition. I hope you receive the care and support you deserve from your medical team.         Nancy Duran  says:    March 7, 2018 at 2:27 pm     Hello My daughter’s test came back 1-65 chance of a Downs baby she is 21 what is your experience with this test?. They want her to get the harmony test witch they said would be more accurate         Mark Leach  says:    March 7, 2018 at 7:19 pm     Based on the odds you report, your daughter as a 1.5% chance that her test result is a true positive and a 98.5% chance that it is a false positive. Tests like Harmony are recognized as more accurate for Down syndrome than conventional screening and the Harmony result would trump a conventional screen result.               SR  says:    August 18, 2015 at 8:54 pm     Hi Mark – As a genetic counselor, I do inform patients that some babies with Down syndrome do pass away during the pregnancy.  Typically there is a ~30% risk of an IUFD after a diagnosis is made by amniocentesis around 16 weeks.  We therefore follow pregnancies with Down syndrome more closely with extra ultrasounds and monitoring in the 3rd trimester.  We unfortunately cannot predict which pregnancies will result in a demise and which will result in a live birth.  But having testing and diagnosing Down syndrome during the pregnancy can help parents be aware that there is an increased risk for a loss.  It also may help providers prevent a loss – if there are concerns about the baby’s growth, for example, then the doctor can induce labor, assuming she’s far enough along.  Do you think that people will be less likely to have testing if they know there’s an increased risk of an IUFD if the baby does have Down syndrome?         Mark Leach  says:    August 19, 2015 at 3:59 pm     I’m not sure whether they would be less likely to have testing if they knew beforehand of the increased chance of natural miscarriage. I do wonder, though, if moms may consider that their pregnancy may naturally miscarry after a diagnosis when considering whether they should terminate the pregnancy, i.e. choose to “let nature’s take its course” rather than intervene with an abortion.         Tarns  says:    September 24, 2015 at 10:54 pm     Hi. I am reading this after just finding out today that we have an increased risk of having a baby with downs syndrone. We have been offered an amnio test and are currently weighing up our options. This is baby number 4 for me and I am 37. My two eldest are already adults and i have a one year old. I have always been pro-choice and have thought previously if I found myself in this position that I would consider a termination. Now I am not sure if I could. I found the information you have provided very informative, and it does make me lean towards just waiting to see what happens. So I think your response to the Dr is valid. It may definitely lead more people to bypass a termination and choose to let nature take its course.         Mark Leach  says:    September 25, 2015 at 8:11 am     Thank you. And if you’d like to learn more about living a life with Down syndrome and the supports available to individuals and their families, check out the Prenatal Resources tab .               Omar  says:    September 14, 2015 at 7:30 am     My wife just delivered our first child who’s diagnosed with ds upon birth. My wife is only 26 and this is our first child, does this indicate particularly high odds for having a second child with DS? Are there any tests that we have to take prior to considering another pregnancy? Thanks alot         Mark Leach  says:    September 14, 2015 at 12:22 pm     Omar: your child should have a karyotype to determine whether your child has nondisjunction Down syndrome or translocation Down syndrome. Then, depending on what type of Down syndrome, check either Table 1 or Table 2 of the NSGC guidelines on delivering a Down syndrome diagnosis, available at this sheets nsgc . I would consult with a genetic counselor about any questions you may have.  The NSGC guidelines also have helpful recommended resources for new parents. I would also recommend as a new parent the American Academy of Pediatrics healthcare Bull AAP , which you can provide to your pediatrician if he or she isn’t familiar with them. Referral to local support organizations is another recommended resource and I hope you were provided your local group’s contact information.           Eghbali  says:    November 8, 2015 at 8:07 pm     Hi. My husband has two children from his ex-wife. The older one is healthy and the younger one has down syndrom. I’m now35 years old and would like to know how high is the percentage of a second child with down syndrom? Thank you in advance for your help.         Mark Leach  says:    November 8, 2015 at 10:15 pm     That’s hard to say as the chance for Down syndrome has been researched based on the mother’s age, but there are few studies based on the father’s. Of the few I’m aware of, there is only a statistical correlation once the father is over 40. I would ask a genetic counselor, but I expect the answer will be that it is your age that is more relevant than your husband having a child with Down syndrome.           Jen  says:    November 28, 2015 at 4:19 pm     Hi Mark, Your website is extremely informative and I’m glad I found it. I’m very confused about the results from my second trimester quad screening and perhaps you can help simplify all the numbers I’ve read on the internet but can’t seem to make sense of. Not sure if this is relevant to the question I’m asking but my NT scan and first trimester screening were “normal.” Anyway, so I’ve read online that the non invasive screening tests identify 80% of women carrying babies with Trisomy 21 and yield a 5% false positive. I had a positive screening of 1:85 risk of Trisomy 21. My doctor explained that I have a little over 1% risk but what does that mean in real terms if the test finds 80% of cases? If I turn out to be one of the 84/85 does that mean I was a false positive? This is what confuses me. If 80% of cases are positively screened what does that mean for someone like me with who’s a higher risk than someone else my age (32). And 80% is such a high proportion whereas 1% seems so low. I can’t seem to reconcile the two in my mind. Sorry if this is a ramble. Thanks so much!         Mark Leach  says:    November 29, 2015 at 3:42 pm     No apology necessary, Jen–you’re experiencing the common confusion with screening tests, which, frankly, the cell free DNA screening labs (cfDNA AKA NIPT) rely on in hyping their claimed accuracy. But you are actually understanding your results correctly. The claimed “accuracy” of cfDNA screens is 99+% for both its ability to detect those pregnancies actually carrying a child with Down syndrome and those pregnancies not carrying a child with Down syndrome (I’m not sure where you’re getting your 80%/5% statistics for cfDNA; I have seen that for other types of screening, but not cfDNA, so I’ll use the 99+% quoted by the labs). Here’s how the screen works in a tested population. At your age, you have somewhere around a 1-in-500 chance of having a child with Down syndrome, based just on your age. Given that your NT scan did not increase that chance, then your baseline remains the same (or more accurately is probably even lower, since the NT did not detect the chance of Down syndrome). So out of 50,000 32 year-old pregnant moms, 100 of them will actually be carrying a child with Down syndrome and 49,900 will not. At the claimed 99+% detection rate, that means the test will result a “positive” for 99 of the 100 moms actually carrying a child with Down syndrome and will report a “negative” for 49,940 of the moms not carrying a child with Down syndrome. But that means 50 of the moms not carrying a child with Down syndrome will receive a “positive” screen result just as the 99 of the moms actually carrying a child with Down syndrome. But for the particular mom, there’s no way of telling whether she is one of the 99 “true positives” or one of the 50 “false positives.” As a result, for every one of the 32 year-old pregnant moms who receive a “positive” screen result, they have a 66% chance of it being a “true positive” and a 34% chance of it being a “false positive.” In your case, you were given a 1-in-85 chance based on your screen result. So, as you correctly state, you could either be the one whose screen result is a “true positive” or you could be one of the 84 “false positives.” I hope this helps and whether it does or not, I would recommend you consult with a genetic counselor or medical geneticist to more fully explain your test results.           Johanna  says:    January 5, 2016 at 1:54 pm     Hi Iam 21 weeks pregnant. My blood results from prenatal screening said there a possibility I can have my baby with DS. She said there is a 30% chance. I’m going to have another ultrasound to see what’s really going on. Iam 23 years old. My 3year old came out perfectly fine. No problems. I’m worried. I don’t know what to think.         Mark Leach  says:    January 5, 2016 at 2:52 pm     Johanna–it depends on what type of prenatal screening you had. If it was the quad screen, your chance of a false positive still outweighs your chance of having a true positive screen result. That applies as well for if you had the newer cell free DNA-type screen like MaterniT21, Harmony, or one of those. The only way to know for certain is to have an amnio or wait until delivery.         KERI  says:    February 26, 2016 at 3:02 am     Hi Mark, I am currently 36 but conceived at 35. I am now 26 weeks. I had 2 soft markers on my ultrasound fetal pyelectasis and EIF. These markers which I was told are also found in healthy ‘normal’ babies can resolve in the 3rd trimester but it sparked them to have me take the materniti21 test which came back positive. Everything else is fine as far as growth. We had a fetal echo which looked great. I never had the NT test bc I was too far along and they couldn’t do it but I was curious what my odds are? They told me I have an 80% chance that she has Down syndrome.  I just don’t understand where that 80% is coming from. Is it all the risks combined or is it from the blood test? We are not going to do an amniocentesis. It doesn’t matter to us if she does have downs but of course it’s not what we had pictured for our lives. I have a completely healthy 10 month oLd right now. It’s all just so hard to swallow. Please help?         Mark Leach  says:    February 26, 2016 at 10:51 am     It sounds as though your providers are basing the 80% chance on what your positive predictive value would be based on your age. You can use this calculator at this link to see for yourself. A mom who conceived at 35 who receives a screen-positive cell free DNA screen (like MaterniT21) has an 80% chance that the result is a “true positive” and a 20% chance that it is a “false positive.” For more on PPV, see this fact sheet . All major medical organizations recommend that patients receive written information about the tested-for condition when receiving a screen positive cfDNA screen result, with the Lettercase booklet being identified as the resource to be provided. Your provider can order a copy for free, you can view the booklet on-line, or (best case) your provider orders several to have in stock for other patients. All of that can be done at the Lettercase website . Because you express an intention to continue your pregnancy, then there is another resource recognized for those moms who decide to continue. Diagnosis to Delivery is a book written by moms for moms and deals with the specific issues that surround having a prenatal result. While your test result remains a “maybe,” i.e. there remains a chance that your child does not have Down syndrome, you may still find the book helpful as you consider the chance of having a child with Down syndrome. The book is available for free as a .pdf or you can order a hardcopy from the Down Syndrome Pregnancy website . Lastly, local Down syndrome support organizations are another resource that both professional medical organizations recognize as being helpful for expectant parents and that expectant parents report finding as a source of support. You can find your local organization via this website . I hope this offering of resources is taken for what it is, to be helpful, and not to further overwhelm you. I wish you a healthy pregnancy and birth of your child.         Sarah  says:    November 1, 2016 at 5:17 pm     Hi Mark, I was wondering if you could comment more on the role of soft markers in the diagnosis of Downs. There appear to be so many babies born without chromosomal defects despite the presence of multiple markers on their ultrasounds, yet practitioners are still required to mention that there is a connection. My fetus has two markers (EIF & a mildly dilated kidney), and I received a “low risk” from the Harmony test, but I can’t get the idea of DS out of my head. I’m 36 weeks along and finding myself frightened and distracted solely because of these findings; wishing I hadn’t heard that they had any connection to chromosomal issues in the first place. I know the odds are well on my side, but I just can’t seem to find solace in the unknown. The harmony test accurately determined his gender – does that mean there’s a likelihood that it accurately assessed his risk for DS as well? Thanks.         Mark Leach  says:    November 2, 2016 at 10:16 am     Per the most recent guidelines , ultrasound findings of “soft markers” are to be followed up with serum screening, if that had not yet been offered. In your case, you’ve already had serum screening via the Harmony test, which is screen negative. While there remains the chance of a false negative, the Harmony result is more reliable than the ultrasound findings.                 manuel Gonzalez  says:    March 8, 2016 at 1:56 pm     my wife and i are having our 3rd baby we have a 6 year old girl and a 3 year old boy, our son was born with DS our first my daughter is normal but we just got word that our soon to be born has a 1 in 29 chance of been born with DS and my wife is devastated she really broke down when she got the blood results now our son was a 1 in 3 chance this one is different we are both 34 years old. she is 4 and a half months and this was only the blood test that she got back we still have not done the ” ambio” i apologize if miss spell the name, my wife does not want to do that test she did it the first time and she hates it.  Please tell me what are the odds of having another child with DS. thank you         Mark Leach  says:    March 8, 2016 at 2:15 pm     The rule of thumb after having a pregnancy positive for Down syndrome is that your baseline chances in subsequent pregnancies are 1-in-100. Without knowing what type of blood test you were given, I cannot confidently say what your adjusted chances are. I would ask your provider if the 1-in-3 chance you were quoted is the “positive predictive value.” If your provider is not aware of that term, he or she can learn more at this link . Here is an on-line calculator that may also be helpful in determining your chances.           Amanda Shine  says:    March 15, 2016 at 9:48 am     My harmony nipt produced a result of 95% risk T21. This is slightly less then typical +ve results. I am 12 weeks gestation and awaiting my cvs results. I have been advised by my doctor to wait for the karyotype before making decisions/ taking action. Why were my harmony results less conclusive then typical? Are you able to advise. We are facing agonising uncertainty.         Mark Leach  says:    March 15, 2016 at 4:55 pm     I think you have overestimated the accuracy of tests like Harmony. They are almost never 99% accurate and your chances based on a screen positive is relative to your age, with the lower the age, the lower the actual chance, e.g. a 30 year old mom getting a screen-positive Harmony result still would only have a 50% chance of having a child with Down syndrome. These tests are just screening tests and are never truly positive or negative. The only way to know about that is through diagnostic testing. To find out your actual chances based on your age and more about these tests, see this post and links in it.           Lisa  says:    March 17, 2016 at 11:15 pm     I’m in my 3rd trimester now an my doctor did a test screening,told me my child was at low risk of having Down syndrome. So dose that mean my baby will have Down syndrome?         Lisa  says:    March 17, 2016 at 11:19 pm     An I’m at the age of 23         Mark Leach  says:    March 18, 2016 at 10:35 am     That means the odds that your child will have Down syndrome are low, i.e. unlikely. What those odds are depend on your age and what screening test was done. Given that you are 23 and you have a screening test which your doctor is interpreting as low risk, then that would suggest you have a very low chance that your baby has Down syndrome–lower than just your already low likelihood given your relative young age.           Elyse Avelar  says:    March 29, 2016 at 5:53 pm     I recently went through my NT scan (blood work and Ultrasound) to check for abnormalities and Down Syndrome. I am only 26 and have no family history of it- nor does my husband… i got a call the following day… I tested POSITIVE for down syndrome. …. my heart sank. I dont really know what else she told me- but i do recall having to ask what my chances where. thats when she said ” 1 in 59″… anyway- i made an appointment to see the Genetics Counselor to go more in depth with my results. She told us that there is a 98% chance the baby is completely fine- and only 2% (2/100) chance the baby has DS. They suggest a few additional tests to check including the amnio and some type of cervix scrap- also to get the babys actual DNA. I said heck no…. however, I did go for another blood test that is to specifically check the babys chromosomes for the extra one that causes DS… (InformaSeq) I know the Genetics Counsleor said we should be fine- but I still cant help but question all of it. My babys neck fluid was good, 1.2- as far as the blood test, she said they test two proteins and i was low on one of them. (.17) and the other I was exactly where i should be. Could you give me any more feed back, clarity or additional advice. should I be worried? I am waiting for the results of the informaSeq and I am terrified. This is our first child.         Mark Leach  says:    March 30, 2016 at 10:08 am     I’m surprised to hear them state the likelihood of Down syndrome even at 2/100 given your relative young age and that it is based only on a NT-combined screen. Nevertheless, InformaSeq is a more accurate screen, but it does not test the baby’s chromosomes as covered at this post . Ultimately, the only way to know for certain is with an amnio, however, should your InformaSeq come back negative, many women are choosing to rely on the relatively low chance of a false negative instead of taking on the risk of miscarriage associated with an amnio. Should your InformaSeq come back screen-positive, again, it can still be a false positive, and the only way to know for sure is with an amnio. If your InformaSeq comes back screen positive, professional guidelines recommend you receive written resources and referral to support resources. You can find those at the Prenatal Resources Tab on this site.         Elyse Avelar  says:    March 30, 2016 at 1:07 pm     Do you think the 2/100 odds are too low given my age? I have been seeing a lot of people with higher odds- and older than me. I did not understand that since the Genetics Counselor stated that a low PAPP-A wasn’t such a big deal and she believes the baby would be fine.         Mark Leach  says:    March 30, 2016 at 1:16 pm     The way you relayed the 2/100 odds, that is what is considered the positive predictive value (PPV), i.e. the likelihood that your child has Down syndrome. Actually, though, having rerun my own calculations based on estimates of the accuracy of the NT-combined and your maternal age, your PPV would be 2% based on the NT-combined. Because the chance of having a child with Down syndrome increases with the mother’s age, that is why you’re seeing higher odds with older mothers–because PPV is a reassessment of your baseline chance for having a child with Down syndrome based on your age. As your Genetic Counselor advised you, based on the NT-combined result, you have a 98% chance that your child does not have Down syndrome. The InformaSeq will provide a further revision of these probabilities.               Keri  says:    March 31, 2016 at 3:36 am     Mark, I posted back on Feb 26th, 2016.  I wanted to update you on the soft markers.  I am now 31 weeks and the markers have dissappeared (pylectasis and EIF).  In your professional opinion would this lower my risk?  The baby’s growth is perfect and they do not see any other problems as of now.  I just can’t stop obsessing about this and can’t wait until our sweet girl gets here.  I just thought I would see what you thought.  I appreciate all of your feedback. Thank you.         Mark Leach  says:    March 31, 2016 at 10:39 am     Thank you for following up. Just so you know, I’m an attorney and bioethicist, so my opinion should not be relied upon for professional medical advice. That said, I do not think the resolution of the anatomical soft markers have any bearing on whether your child has an extra 21st Chromosome (the cause of Down syndrome) or not. I would still put your PPV at 80% based on your MaterniT21 result. I hope the resources I linked to in my earlier reply were helpful and that your medical team has been supportive as you have continued your pregnancy. I wish you a healthy delivery.         KERI  says:    May 26, 2016 at 8:52 am     Mark,  I followed this post through my whole pregnancy. My percentage with maternity 21 testing was 80% chance she had DS.  My baby was born this past Monday 5/23/16 @ 1136am and it was confirmed at birth that she indeed does have down syndrome. She is healthy as a horse and she is beautiful. I wanted to thank you for all of your knowledge and for sharing it with us.  Keri         Mark Leach  says:    May 26, 2016 at 12:44 pm     Keri–I’m glad to hear that what has been shared here was helpful–really the reason for doing this! I’m also glad to hear that your daughter is doing well. Every child is different just as we all are, so there is no set path. However, I do share about my daughter so that it’s a vision of what life can be like, at least for her. This past Sunday, we attended her third dance recital and yesterday, we attended her graduation from Elementary School. Here’s a post on her dance recital from 2014 with video of her performing. I hope you have similar happy times to look forward to with your little girl.         KERI  says:    May 29, 2016 at 1:18 am     Thank you so much for sharing that with me. She is an amazing dancer! Congrats to her on the photo contest too, that is a wonderful accomplishment. I have no doubts for my baby girl! I know she will move mountains. I will get her involved in as much as possible. I can’t wait to see how she will flourish. Thank you again for the information throughout my pregnancy. I was rather obsessed with reading and learning  as much as I could and your blog is one I kept coming back to. Thanks again! Keri                 Katie Lindsey  says:    May 17, 2016 at 8:41 pm     I am 25 years old and had an average nt measurement of 2.96 the doctor really scared me and started telling me this probably means our baby has down syndrome or one of the trisomy’s I’m worried we did the inmoraseq test and waiting for results         Mark Leach  says:    May 18, 2016 at 2:47 pm     Your doctor is incorrect. At your age, the NT screen would not result in a more probable than not recalculation of the chances you are having a child with Down syndrome. When you receive your cell free DNA screen results, use the links at this post to determine what your chances are and to find resources that should be helpful for you and your doctor.           kim  says:    May 19, 2016 at 10:01 am     I’m 26 and the screening came back positive. just like everyone eels, I’m nervous that the child will have ds. the doctor did tell me that there is a very low risk of having ds. I’m going to the specialist to find out more. I’m very worried         Mark Leach  says:    May 21, 2016 at 11:19 am     At your age, a screen positive result would mean you have a 47% chance that it is a false positive. Please see this post and the links in it for helpful resources to understand your test results and supportive resources about Down syndrome.         kim  says:    May 21, 2016 at 5:11 pm     would it come out positive if the due date is wrong?         Mark Leach  says:    May 21, 2016 at 5:55 pm     It depends on what test you had. If you had conventional screening, like a Nuchal Translucency or a quad, then, yes, the gestation date is factored into the algorithm. With cell free DNA, not so much, since the primary driver for accuracy there is how much cell free DNA from the pregnancy was included in the sample–though the later the pregnancy, the more accurate cell free DNA screening is precisely because there is more cell free DNA as the pregnancy goes along.               Amanda  says:    May 25, 2016 at 3:09 am     Hi Mark. It took quite a few hours of surfing the web before I stumbled across your page, but it was worth the wait to find it. My husband and I decided 8 years into our marriage to try to have a child; I was 35. I already had concerns at that time because of my age, and because of various health problems (IBS and severe arthritis throughout my body). About a year after we made the decision, my husband fell ill, so after a few years I figured it wasn’t in the cards. Imagine my surprise when last June (at age 40) I found myself pregnant. I had a lot of problems from day one: constant pain, and an overwhelming feeling that something wasn’t right. They did the quad testing and kept telling me that everything was “fine with the baby”, but didn’t really seem all that concerned with my overall physical health. My husband and I insisted on amnio (even though they kept asking me if I was absolutely sure I wanted to do that since all the bloodwork they did said everything was fine), along with the FISH test. When they got the results of the FISH test they told us there was a high probability that the baby had Downs, but to not get too concerned until the final results of the amnio. Two days later it was confirmed the baby had Trisomy-21. We decided to terminate the pregnancy. 2 weeks later when the clinic preformed an ultrasound before the procedure, we found that the baby had already passed. I have major concerns about trying to have another child, and everyone seems to have different numbers as far as the odds of this happening again. I don’t know if I can go through that heartbreak again, especially since I’ll be 42 in a few months. I know a lot of women are conceiving later in life, but I have to wonder if the ones who are having successful pregnancies are in good health overall, or if that even matters. A lot of places online don’t mention how the women are health-wise, just that they are a(n) “advanced maternal age”. Thanks for reading my ramble, any advice would be greatly appreciated.         Mark Leach  says:    May 25, 2016 at 12:17 pm     I am not aware of other health issues being related to the incidence for Down syndrome. Therefore, based on your age and having had a previous pregnancy positive for Trisomy 21, according to the National Society of Genetic Counselors (see page 3, Table 1, column 1), your chances are 1.7 times your base-line, age-based chance. Based on an age-based chance at 42 of around 1:65, multiplied by 1.7 (for the previous pregnancy), your revised baseline chance is around 2.6%. That said, I would recommend meeting with a genetic counselor about pre-pregnancy counseling to ask this and other questions you likely have.           Vic  says:    June 19, 2016 at 6:18 am     Hi Mark.  My wife is 12weeks pregnant and after an ultrasound where the doctor can’t see any nose bone and the fluid between the baby’s nape and the skin is thick, he suggested CVS. My wife also had blood test and it came back high risk for ds as well. The FISH results from the CVS came back positive. Is there any chance that the tests are false positives? How accurate is the CVS test really? Because we were told that it’s a 100% accurate. Should we go for Amniosintesis? Hope you can provide us some light         Mark Leach  says:    June 19, 2016 at 1:36 pm     CVS is not 100% accurate. It tests chorionic villi from the placenta which can be cells that develop into the fetus and cells that develop into the placenta. Therefore, the test result could be of cells from the placenta with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), or it could be that your child has mosaic Down syndrome, where only a portion of the child’s cells has an extra 21st Chromosome. FISH results are to be considered screen results only and not diagnostic. CVS is considered diagnostic, but it does have some false positives. At the same time, amniocentesis can also have false positives, but at a much lower rate. The most accurate test is amnio.           Tom  says:    July 8, 2016 at 7:57 am     Very interesting blog thank you. We are expecting twins and have been given a lower risk for downs of 1 in 386 and 1 in 382. I was wondering though if there is any correlation in risk in twins. We have also been told that it is most likely that they are not identical.         Mark Leach  says:    July 8, 2016 at 12:56 pm     Due to the incidence of twins being so low, coupled with the low incidence rate for Down syndrome, there just isn’t much out there on twins and Down syndrome. But I am not aware of there being any correlation in risk in twins.           Kylie  says:    July 29, 2016 at 3:15 am     Today was by far the scariest day of my life. I receive my blood results from my genetic testing and the DR told me I have 1 in 68 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. I’m 24 and this is my third child. I’m a couple days shy of 17 weeks. I’ve never had any concerns with my previous pregnancies. I have a high level ultrasound scheduled for next Friday 8 days from now. how could by blood test be wrong? I heard that the blood test could be a false positive but how could it be wrong? How could they get the chromosome count incorrect??         Mark Leach  says:    July 29, 2016 at 11:25 am     It depends on what test you had. But whatever test you had, you had what is called a screening test. Whether you had a conventional screening test of the nuchal combined test or one of the cell free DNA screening tests, being screening tests, they each have false positives and false negatives. As such, while they are testing either chemicals in your blood with a correlation to the chance for Down syndrome, or, in the case of cell free DNA, testing DNA that may be from the fetus or may just be from the placenta (see this post here for that explanation), there is a chance that their calculations are off. Based on your Doctor saying you have a 1-in-68 chance, that means you have a 1.4% chance of your scree result being a true positive and a 98.6% chance of it being a false positive. The odds are in your favor that your result is a false positive.         Kylie  says:    August 10, 2016 at 5:24 am     After my level 2 ultrasound 2 soft markers were detected one on the heart and the other on the bowels. My risk increased to 20% according to the Dr for DS. I declined the amino to wait for the Maternit21 results to come in. Well today they did and I am now “positive for DS” the obgyn said the test is 99% accurate and expect the worse. I’m scared of the unknown. Should I in fact expect for my child to have DS?         Mark Leach  says:    August 10, 2016 at 2:42 pm     Tests like MaterniT21 are almost never 99% accurate, in the sense that no matter their results, it is the rarest of cases when it means you have a 99% chance of having a child with Down syndrome (see this post here). However, if your earlier results that you reported were based off of a conventional screening test, then using that 1-in-68 ratio results in the chances that your MaterniT21 test result is a true positive being 94%, with a 6% chance of your result being a false positive. Put another way, you have a 94% chance that your child has Down syndrome. You can find the calculator and more explanation about this at this post . With your test result, you should’ve received patient support information about Down syndrome. You can find those recommended resources at the Prenatal Resources Tab .               Susan McCarthy  says:    August 11, 2016 at 7:54 am     I am 37 and pregnant with my 4th lost my 3rd due to miscarriage. I had 2 normal pregnancies in my 20s and so far my pregnancy has been easy (knock on wood). From what I understand my chances of having a baby with ds are 1\186 chance, I am really scare that my hypothyroidism might make my risk factors even higher. No matter what happens I will love the baby no matter what I am just extrelly worried.         niki  says:    September 6, 2016 at 1:22 pm     Whats my percentage to have a ds baby if im 21 and i only had the blood test         Mark Leach  says:    September 6, 2016 at 1:59 pm     It depends on which “blood test” you are referring to. If you are referring to AFP or a first trimester serum sample combined with a measurement of your fetus’ neck, then whatever the result, you have a very large chance of any screen positive being a false positive. If you had one of the newer cell free DNA screens, like MaterniT21 or Harmony, then the chance of a screen positive being a true positive is 49%–meaning you have as good of a chance that it is a false positive as it being a true positive. You can find out more at this post and the links therein.           Marie White  says:    September 7, 2016 at 4:07 pm     I am having a difficult time understanding the Panorama Risk Score. My positive predictive value came back at 91% and the fetal fraction was 10.8%. The panorama risk score is >99/100. Does that mean that the chance for baby to have trisomy 21 is greater than 99 out of 100???         Marie White  says:    September 7, 2016 at 4:16 pm     Also, the dr attempted to check for nuchal translucency. He was never able to get the baby in full profile, but did a transvaginal ultrasound and tried to look that way. Is it still accurate if the baby was not in profile?         Mark Leach  says:    September 7, 2016 at 5:27 pm     It sounds as though what the report was relaying is that the 91% is your positive predictive value (PPV), i.e. the actual chance that your result is a true positive versus a false positive. See this post here and the links in that post on why these tests are almost never “99% accurate” and a calculator where you can enter your age and find out your PPV. I can’t answer the question about the nuchal scan, but regardless, a Panorama result would take precedence over that scan for the conditions that Panorama tests for.         Marie White  says:    September 7, 2016 at 6:06 pm     Thank you so much for your reply. I went to the calculator on the link and calculated the PPV. Can you tell me what makes this number different than the PPV that panorama listed on the report? Panorama report said 91% PPV and calculator via the link said 75%. What causes the disparity between those values? Thank you again for your reply in this difficult time.         Mark Leach  says:    September 8, 2016 at 10:40 am     That’s a question only Panorama could explain. You could ask your Genetic Counselor or whomever ordered the test to ask Panorama for an explanation.         Marie White  says:    September 8, 2016 at 10:43 am     Thanks again for taking the time to reply.                 Kari  says:    September 11, 2016 at 11:12 pm     Hello- I recently received a level 2 ultrasound and everything looks great with the baby except they said the nose bone was at 4.8 and it should’ve 5 or greater. They proceeded to tell me that my odds of having a baby with down is 1:10. I’m 36 years old and have two girls prior with nod own syndrome. I thought based off of this one thing that was done through an ultrasound seemed to increase the odds greatly. There were no other markers. what are your thoughts on this data that they have provided me with? I don’t want to do any testing, however that 1:10 has my mind running wild. Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    September 12, 2016 at 10:23 am     Nasal bone measurement is considered a “soft marker” and not recognized for an accuracy to base a 1:10 chance off of alone. I wonder where they got that from as it isn’t recognized in any professional organization’s guidelines for prenatal testing. I would challenge them on what their basis was for that risk score.         Kari  says:    September 15, 2016 at 6:30 pm     So based on your experience the odds would be more in our favor? Some research that I have read says that a shortened nasal bone is considered a “hard marker”, do you find this to be inaccurate based off of your research? I will definitely challenge them on this as I do have many questions. Thanks for your response.         Mark Leach  says:    September 16, 2016 at 10:22 am     Have them consult their professional organization’s guidelines, e.g. ACOG or NSGC. I’ve never seen a nasal bone referred to as as anything other than a soft marker.               Ashley  says:    September 28, 2016 at 4:12 pm     Hi, when I was 21yrs old I had my first child. He was born with DS. I was tested then and did not carry the gene for DS. At 31 yrs old My second child was born a heathy baby girl with no special needs. My husband and I tried for a 3rd child a year later and we miscarried at 18weeks. She was also downs. I had my chromosomes retested and still negative for the downs gene. Why do I keep having downs babies if I dont carry the gene?         Mark Leach  says:    September 29, 2016 at 8:01 pm     After having a child with Down syndrome, the chances of having another child with Down syndrome increase. Plus, as you age, your chances for having a child with Down syndrome increase. I would expect the combination of having had a child with Down syndrome and then a decade elapsing between your third pregnancy likely explains the increased chance. That said, your chance is still somewhere around 1% or a little higher. A genetic counselor could counsel you on your future chances for having a child with Down syndrome.           sonumaddythakur  says:    September 29, 2016 at 4:46 am     My wife is 27 year old and during pregenecy of 14 weeks quadple test shows increase risk of down syndrome as tri-21 1:98 and age risk 1:1192 should be go for aminocentesis? and also explain how much % risk is there for down syndrome         Mark Leach  says:    September 29, 2016 at 8:04 pm     The quad test, while it is an indicator of high risk, has far, far, far more false positives than true positives. If available, you may wish to consider having cell free DNA screening and then decide whether to risk a miscarriage with amniocentesis.           Izabela  says:    October 1, 2016 at 11:11 pm     I have question about my 1 st trimester screening results. DSR- aldough within normative range- is at intermediate level beging definded as Duwn syndrome risk between 1:300-1.1000 . An intermediate risk is susceptible to significant up – risking or singnificant down- ruskingdependi g upon the result of corelative screening studies such as modifier sequential screen, fetal DNA in material serum .how can I understand the test results?         Mark Leach  says:    October 6, 2016 at 11:39 am     I wish I could help, but I can’t make sense of these results either. I would consult with a genetic counselor or medical geneticist.           Ferial  says:    November 6, 2016 at 11:28 pm     Hi Mark, I’m 41.9 years old with the history of one miscarriage at age 41. I am pregnant again and 18 weeks now. I just received my SIPS results and it is positive screen for DS (1:110). My health practitioner missed the Nuchal translucency. So, my results are only based on the first and second semesters blood testes. I am very shocked, confused, and heartbroken. I read many posts that there could be a false positive, but I am still very hopeless. I had NIPT test a few days ago and still waiting for the results. I also had a detailed ultrasound on 17 W and 4 days (after getting my SIPS results) and no abnormalities was found. I searched a lot to find a website to calculate my odds myself for SIP but I do’n seem to find the one. I’d appreciate your comments about my situation. Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    November 7, 2016 at 12:00 pm     I’m unaware of a calculator for a SIPS result, but the published accuracy rates for Serum Integrated Prenatal Screening (SIPS) is around 85% detection with a 5% false positive rate. That does not mean you only have a 5% chance of a false positive–it means 5% of all SIPS patients will receive a false positive. From your report of 1:110, that means you have a 0.9% chance of actually having a child with Down syndrome and a 99.1% chance of it being a false positive. The screen report of 1:110 is actually longer odds than just your baseline chance based on your age, which would be around 1:70 or so.           Kayla/worried first time mommy  says:    November 9, 2016 at 10:37 am     Hi. So I’m 23 years old expecting my first baby. I had the NT done and the quad screening done in the first and second trimester. The first one came back good but after the second one it shows that I have a positive risk of the baby having Down syndrome. (1/100) I am worried because of how young I am that it came back positive at all. Is the false positive rate higher for me because of how young I am? And if so what are the chances of it being a false positive. I tried to use the ppv calculator but haven’t had any luck because I don’t know if I’m using it right? And is it true that there are a lot of false positives and that most baby’s are ok despite it being a positive risk? Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    November 9, 2016 at 11:50 am     It appears your quad report came back with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 1/100, i.e. that you have a 1% chance of actually having a child with Down syndrome and a 99% chance of your result being a false positive. Considering that disparity in odds, the odds are vastly in favor of your result being a false positive. Your relative young age would inform the PPV analysis, but if the 1/100 is the PPV for the test, then your age was already taken into account. You may want to confirm with your provider that the 1/100 is the PPV for the quad test. If so, then you have a 99% chance that your result is a false positive.         Stacie Marshall  says:    December 18, 2017 at 11:04 pm     Hello 32 yr 22 weeks into my second pregnancy ,1st ultasound and level 2 ultrasound both no markers. But quad materniti test, and amnio all came back positive does that mean its definite for DS next appt i have scripts for 3rd ultasound and echo on baby heart is this. Sure diagnosis on DS         Mark Leach  says:    December 19, 2017 at 10:21 am     If you had screen positive for your quad and MaterniT21 test and a positive amnio, then that is a diagnosis for Down syndrome. If you weren’t provided this, here is the link to the resource on Down syndrome that professional guidelines recommend accompany any positive test result.               DownsMom  says:    November 10, 2016 at 2:04 am     I have 2 daughters. 15 and 16. My youngest has Down Syndrome. I was 18 and 20 when I had them. I had the normal tests done when i was pregnant and everything came back normal. I didn’t know she was down syndrome until I had her. At first I was in denial about it. I was afraid. I did get very angry at a nurse one day for asking me if I knew she was Down Syndrome while I was pregnant would I have aborted her. There was no way. She was my baby and I loved her. I would not change her for anything in the world. She is the most loving and funny kid. She definitely has a personality to her. Yes she does go to the doctor often and has some health issues. But I am her mom and will protect and take care of her any way I can. So I am saying this to any other mother that is pregnant with a baby with Down Syndrome, please don’t even think of abortion. Please don’t pick and choose what child you think is best for you. They are such a gift. There is no love like no other than the love of your child, especially with DS. You are their protector, no matter the diagnosis. I am now 35 years old and 6 weeks pregnant. I don’t want to sound like a hypocrite but I am worried about having another baby with Down Syndrome. My daughter does take up most of my time and attention but I wouldnt have it any other way. I’m just worried about the health risks that come with DS…not myself but my baby.         Mark Leach  says:    November 10, 2016 at 8:41 am     I wish you a healthy pregnancy and delivery. High level ultrasounds may be able to allay some concerns you have about whether your child has any health issues.           Kayla/ worried first time mommy  says:    November 12, 2016 at 10:55 am     Ok so they said the same thing you did. They said the chance of my baby having Down syndrome is 1%. So that is reassuring but they still wanted me to take the maternit21 test and I did and am waiting on the results of that. I’m just kind of scared of getting another positive though. What are the chances of the materniti21 being a false positive for my age. With the chance of 99% that the baby doesn’t have Down syndrome I feel like as you said thats pretty good odds that my baby doesn’t. So I’m just kind of wondering what your thoughts are on that?         Mark Leach  says:    November 12, 2016 at 11:10 am     The 99% false positive chance is more an indicator of the lack of precision for conventional serum screening. MaterniT21 has a much higher detection rate for Down syndrome. Therefore, a screen negative result will mean a greater than 99% chance that your child does not have Down syndrome. A screen positive result would mean a 92% chance that your child has Down syndrome and an 8% chance that the result is a false positive, based off of your recalculated chance of 1/100 from your conventional screen.         Kayla/worried first time mommy  says:    November 12, 2016 at 11:43 am     Ok thanks for your help. So just a personal question. If it was you waiting on this test result would you feel as if there is a lot to worry about? Because I’m the type of person where when it comes to this kind of stuff I over stress and I know it’s not good for the baby but I would really like your honest opinion as if you feel I have a lot to worry about         Mark Leach  says:    November 12, 2016 at 12:16 pm     A difficult question for me to answer fairly. We did not undergo prenatal testing and my wife has said she was glad because she would have worried no matter the result. At the same time, when we learned postnatally that our daughter had Down syndrome, I was very sad and grieved for quite a while, worrying about what life would have in store for my little girl. It has only been in the experience of raising my daughter that I came to meet many other children and adults with Down syndrome, gain a better understanding about what their lives are like, and realize that all the things I worried about for my daughter are things that are years off in the future. By the time any of those concerns could happen, like where will she live, will she have a good job, and what can we do to minimize the risk of sexual assault (my worst fear), we will have parented her and lived with her for years and thousands of hours. Hopefully, having that time to prepare, we will be ready to handle whatever challenges come. I share all this just to say, if I were in your position, I would worry, because I did worry, but it’s only with the passage of time, the realization of how much support there is out there for my daughter and others like her with Down syndrome, that I now barely worry and instead revel in enjoying her grow up into her own person.               verushca  says:    December 2, 2016 at 2:05 am     Hi Mark, I’m 28 years old and pregnant with my second child. I had my first child at a very young age and in the time that I was pregnant with her, these types downs testing was not really done In SA so we never knew about these test during my first pregnancy,  my daughter was born in 2005 and is perfectly healthy and very clever. Now that I am pregnant again,  I had to go for an NT scan in my first trimester (which was not done with first pregnancy) everything came back normal accept the neck thickness which was 2.8mm because of that I had to go for downs blood screening and went to see a fetal assessment specialist yesterday,  she gave me the blood results and the papp-a result were not to good but the hcg was fine, they gave me a 1:96 result based on the blood and NT results,  we then did a complete level 2 scan and she scanned from head to toe saying she is happy with everything but then said at the end that there is a small white spot on the heart and colon. Which then gave me a 1:16result I then did amniocentesis and will have to wait 3 weeks for the results but in the meantime I am so stressed out about everything.  What are the chances that these test excluding the amnio could have been false and what are the chances that the white spots on the heart and colon can actually be nothing as this is the first time that they actually picked that up? Am I possibly being stressed out over nothing and maybe the doctors these days try and make a diagnosis too soon? Or pick something up on scans that might have nothing to do with down syndrome?  Are all these test really being done correctly with so many false positives?  Regards Verushca         Mark Leach  says:    December 7, 2016 at 2:42 pm     Verushca–the nature of screening tests, like the nuchal and the ultrasound, are that they are not definitive, so they always have false positives and false negatives. In your case, your providers quoted you the odds of around a 1% chance your child had Down syndrome based on the nuchal, which means a 99% chance that your child does not have Down syndrome. I’m not sure what they’re basing the 1:16 result for just the ultrasound, but even that is only a 6% chance of actually having Down syndrome and a 94% chance your child does not have Down syndrome. Anxiety is also commonly associated with screening results. I’m not sure how common or rare the ultrasound findings are for other children, but any ultrasound finding is simply a “soft marker,” meaning one that is associated with a condition but one that cannot be relied on as a true indicator of the condition. I hope the amnio results provide you certainty.           Stephanie  says:    December 9, 2016 at 10:53 am     Hi Mark! I just had my first prenatal appointment and was asked if I wanted to have the first trimester screening done. I’m 25 and I just want to know what exactly I’m looking at as far as the chances I will have a baby with DS. I know the odds are 1:1250 but what percentage am I looking at? Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    December 9, 2016 at 8:19 pm     Given your age and provided there are no other factors, e.g. prior aneuploidy miscarriage, sibling with aneuploidy, then your chances of having a child with Down syndrome would be 0.08%, with a 99.92% chance that you are not having a child with Down syndrome. Those percentages are based just off your age. If you had screening testing, that would recalculate your chances.         Stephanie  says:    December 10, 2016 at 12:28 pm     So screening alone changes your odds?         Mark Leach  says:    December 11, 2016 at 2:11 pm     Screening provides a recalculation of your odds, but screening always has false positives and false negatives.               Peter  says:    December 19, 2016 at 1:06 am     My wife is pregnant since 8/27 and I am wondering if there might be some miscalculation based on the “weeks” of pregnancy which might throw the blood test for T21/T18/T13 calculations off. She been tested for 1:55 for T21 yet she is only 27 going on 28 when delivering the baby. Might I ask how are the weeks calculated for term? From my calculation its only been 15 weeks when she took the blood test and shouldn’t the blood test for AFP, hCG, T21, T18 and T13 be taken during week 16 ~ 18? Would the earlier test throw the figures off? Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    December 19, 2016 at 2:28 pm     I believe the quad test is recognized for the aneuploidy conditions such as Down syndrome, but, that being said, appreciate that the quad result means your pregnancy has a 1.8% chance of actually being positive for Down syndrome and a 98.2% of being a false positive.           julie  says:    January 12, 2017 at 5:40 am     I’m 44 and this is my 8th pregnancy lol.All seven were born vaginally, healthy,zero problems whatsoever I wasn’t 44 tho either 🙂 my baby will be 9 in march .I’m about 7 weeks haven’t been to the docs yet and I can only imagine the he’ll I’m gonna catch from the ob  docs when I refuse any and all invasive precedures ..I personally think an amniocentesis is just one more risk factor to add to the list ..I say no ty ..I wonder tho if there’s percentages and numbers on the amnt.of pregnancies that have been adversely affected by the test itself..I doubt very seriously there’s a reliable count .what do you think?         Mark Leach  says:    January 13, 2017 at 2:49 pm     Congratulations on your pregnancy. The historically quoted number is that amnios have between a 0.5% and 1.0% chance of miscarriage associated with them. However, the more accurate number is the rate experienced by the doctor actually performing the procedure and the rate at the facility where the procedure is performed. Like anything, the more experience the doctor and facility have, the lower the rate of miscarriage.         nm  says:    January 13, 2017 at 7:31 pm     Hi I’m 16 weeks pregnant, I did the harmony test and came back 99% positive for T21 the nuchal translucency measures 4.5. I had the amnio 2 days ago and wating for results.         Mark Leach  says:    January 17, 2017 at 11:36 am     See these two posts here and here . In the second one, the calculator linked in it can show you your actual chance for having a child with Down syndrome (it’s not 99%). You’ll need to enter your age. The fact sheets should be helpful along with the resources on Down syndrome linked in the second post.               Sam  says:    January 17, 2017 at 9:49 am     Hi Mark, I’m due an amneocentisis based on the Quad test I had at 13 weeks pregnant, although I had this in previous 2 pregnancies I just agreed thinking all would be OK. Not the case this time around. My NT came back at 2mm my Papp-a was 0.85 but my beta hcg was super high at 9.22mom which should be only 1, scan was fine. My chances of having a baby with DS are 1 in 87, I’ve tried to get doctors and midwife to elaborate on this for me to understand but it’s like hitting a brick wall. Like they don’t know either. My only answer from the consultant was it is a very complex computer system that works out the odds! How? I am 34 now and have chosen amnio to get answers really as I need to know how to plan ahead. Yet I am an emotional wreck as I know despite the outcome I am putting my baby at risk of miscarriage and that as a mum to be is hard as we do everything we can in pregnancy to keep our babies safe. Having the amnio is like the ultimate betrayal and I’m not in a good place but i need to know. Wish I had never had the test as now I’m on an emotional roller coaster. Just need to know if hormone levels can still be high at 13 weeks? I’m clutching at straws but really dreading the amnio. Thanks         Mark Leach  says:    January 17, 2017 at 11:41 am     Unfortunately, I cannot interpret the mystery of screening algorithms either. They are usually proprietary to the lab and therefore are not shared publicly. Amnios are not to be performed before 15 weeks. You may have time before then to request a cell free DNA screening test, like MaterniT21, Harmony, or one available in your locale. Many moms are relying on a screen-negative result from those screening tests as the chance of a false negative is extremely low. With conventional screening, like quad and NT, on the other hand, the chance of a false positive typically exceeds the chance of a screen result being a true positive. In seeking information, you may also find helpful the professionally recommended resources on Down syndrome at this link .         Sam  says:    January 17, 2017 at 1:09 pm     Thank you for the reply Mark, I am now 15 weeks + 4 days. I have amnio booked in 2 days time, although don’t know if I will go through with this. I was going to pay for the harmony test privately at £405 as I am in the UK and it is not available on our NHS until 2018. I chose not to do this as I have been informed that it will only come back with a high/low risk and not a definitive answer. I have found this site very useful aswell and I believe my heart will takeover and fears I have in my mind so thank you.             Courtney  says:    January 31, 2017 at 7:56 am     I’m 21 and I already have a 3 yr old who is perfectly healthy with nothing wrong at all. Now pregnant with my second and had the screening test done and it showed positive for DS it says 1:300 is that a low risk?         Mark Leach  says:    January 31, 2017 at 10:47 am     A 1-in-300 chance that your pregnancy is positive for Down syndrome, means you have a 0.3% chance of having a child with Down syndrome and a 99.7% chance that you are not having a child with Down syndrome. Based on just your age, you had around a 1-in-1,400 chance of having a child with Down syndrome. So, your screen result is at a higher chance than just your age-based chance, which would be literally an “increased” chance. However, you can decide if a 0.3% chance is high risk. And, for perspective’s sake, feel free to check out some of the “ Our story ” posts to see how relatively healthy my daughter, who happens to have Down syndrome, is.           Jessica Scott  says:    March 23, 2017 at 9:37 am     I’m 39 and 16 weeks pregnant. I had the blood screening done 12 weeks and 6 days which came back with a 93% risk based on my age and the blood work for Down syndrome. The fluid behind baby’s neck measured at 2.5 mm. There were no other soft markers on the ultrasound. I had two miscarriages prior and no living children. Thus far this has been a wonderful pregnancy with the exception of the normal hormonal changes and an increase in my appetite. Since getting the results this is not sat well with me for obvious reasons. Both my husband and I earn credibly healthy, vibrant. My husband is even two years younger than me.  We have decided to go to another doctor and get a second opinion as I’ve never met with a doctor but only midwives and a genetic counselor. No one has treated me as high risk from the very beginning and now even with these results no one is talking to us about our questions and concerns. I stumbled across this article in my frantic search about Down syndrome and the likelihood that I’m carrying a child with it. This is been very informative so I thank you for all the information. Based on your knowledge how accurate do you think this blood test is that they’re given me? I will be 40 by the time I deliver which is in September.         Mark Leach  says:    March 23, 2017 at 12:09 pm     According to this calculator , the chance that your result is a true positive is 91% and the chance it is a false positive is 9%. I hope the second opinion provides the answers you are seeking. Professional guidelines also recommend that expectant mothers receive informational resources about Down syndrome with a test result. This link is to the one that is most recommended.           Michelle  says:    April 13, 2017 at 4:51 am     Hi Mark, I went for my 12 week scan and was told I have 1 in 7 chance of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality.  10 week Blood test showed I had ‘low’ levels Scan showed that the fluid behind the neck is between 3.6-3.9. And they said the blood flowing from the placenta is flowing but it is also flowing back- not sure how to describe it.  I had cvs two days ago and am waiting for the results.  Should I prepare myself for the worst?  Thanks for your help         Mark Leach  says:    April 13, 2017 at 8:31 am     I’m unclear on what they are basing the 1-in-7 chance–was it a cell free DNA screen result or just the NT measurement. If just the NT, that is not recognized by itself as a valid screen. And, even if the 1-in-7 is correct, that would still mean you have an 86% chance that your pregnancy is unaffected, i.e. you have an 86% chance that the screen result is a false positive.         Michelle  says:    April 13, 2017 at 3:47 pm     1/7 was based on my age of 34, blood tests and ultrasound screening.  They have just called to say that the preliminary CVS screening (taking cells from the placenta) is positive for Downs Syndrome. I have to wait until next week for the final result.  I can’t believe it! Im devastated!         Mark Leach  says:    April 14, 2017 at 1:57 pm     Receiving the diagnosis is often described as a shock and can take time to process. If you would like to learn more about Down syndrome, this link is for the resource recognized by the major professional medical organizations for expectant mothers. Another recommended resource is your local Down syndrome support organization. I hope these are helpful as you process what the diagnosis may mean.               Sophie  says:    April 24, 2017 at 11:43 am     Hello Mark. First of all your article is fantastic and clearly laid out, making it easy to understand so thank you. I’m currently 18 weeks pregnant and at my 12 week scan the doctor said that everything was normal as far as the soft markers are concerned. However the tri test results came back as 1:120 so we proceeded with an NIPT as we didn’t want the risk of the amniocentesis. That test has come back as positive… I will be doing the amnio tomorrow to be certain of course but there is something I don’t understand. Based on my age (32) I have calculated that I have a 34% chance of it being a false positive but the doctor told me that the test was 95% certain. My confusion comes from the fact that his ‘95%’ is neither the 66% that I have just calculated nor is it the ’99+%’ that the test claims to be… Would you know where his 95% comes from? If that makes sense… Thank you for your time. Sophie         Mark Leach  says:    April 24, 2017 at 7:53 pm     I was curious, too, what your doctor was basing that on, so I entered your revised prevalence rate based off your tri-result of 1:120, expecting that to report a 95% PPV. But, instead, the PPV is only 71%, leaving still a 29% chance of a false positive. So, I don’t know what he’s basing his number on and would be curious what he tells you.         Sophie  says:    April 25, 2017 at 12:42 pm     Well they said that it meant they were 95% sure that it’s a positive and that the remaining 5% was a margin that they give in case of error like mosaicism etc. Maybe I should have mentioned that I live in France so maybe the tests are different?? I did the amnio today and will have the results on Friday but the ultrasound showed that both brain ventricles are enlarged which does point to trisomy 21…         Mark Leach  says:    April 25, 2017 at 3:07 pm     It sounds as though the “95%” figure has no basis except to express that they’re “pretty sure” the test is positive, but it might have a false positive.               Christine  says:    May 16, 2017 at 12:59 pm     I stumbled upon some of your articles regarding the nipt screening while trying to research the outcome of results that I received. At 13 weeks and 4 days I had an nt scan which returned a measurement of 3.6 and I had the nipt blood test which came back with a positive result for trisomy 21. I am 36 years old and have 2 other children without down syndrome.  My doctor tells me the chance of a false positive result on the nipt is .02% that the test is 99.94% accurate as matter of fact the doctor told me the baby has down syndrome without a diagnostic test.  The genetic counselor tells me that the results are most likely accurate but I should confirm results with an amnio. Do you think the info I have been provided is accurate.  Based on what I read the false negative results seem like they may be slightly higher or am I just reaching for false hope?         Mark Leach  says:    May 20, 2017 at 3:41 pm     The information your OB gave you amounts to malpractice . The NT measurement, by itself, is not recognized as a valid screen. Based on your age, your NIPT result actually means you have an 82% chance that it is a true positive and an 18% chance that it is a false positive. (see this calculator here ). Feel free to share with your OB the fact sheets on NIPT available at this post or report him or her to your board of medical licensure to prevent further misinformation.         Christine  says:    May 21, 2017 at 9:16 am     Thanks Mark! I tried to explain to him that I thought he was wrong about the 99.4% but he was not changing his mind. I had an amnio on Thursday and truthfully either way I think now I need a new doctor. Doctors (the person I am trusting with my life and baby’s) should be providing accurate info and not that I wouldn’t still be worried with an 82% chance but a diagnosis before we know for sure has caused lots of anxiety the last 3 weeks that could have been lessened if a different approach was taken.             Michelle  says:    May 26, 2017 at 9:02 am     I recieved a High Risk for T21 using harmony blood test. I am 40, had a CVS today found an absent nasal bone and only 1 artery to the unbilical cord instead of 2. Is there any hope my result will come back normal or what percentage would I have.  Only have my husband for support         Mark Leach  says:    May 30, 2017 at 10:02 am     Based on your age and your Harmony result, you have a 7% chance that it is a false negative. Nasal bone and umbilical arteries are trumped by the Harmony result as far as indicators of T21. You can learn more about T21 from this resource recommended by all major medical organizations.           JaNY  says:    November 13, 2017 at 6:24 am     Hi! I would love to know your opinion. I’m 37 years old. No DS background in either side (me or my husband) I had the Harkony test done result was Negative T21 came out with a chance of 1/226 Nuchal fluid was borderline 2,5mm Nasal bone is present. They have offered the amino but I refused since the abortion chances are high. But I had 1 soft mark in my screenings. They said based in tests and my maternal age chances are T21 1:226 and 99.5 chance of not having a DS Child. I’m currently 18 weeks and just had the early anatomy and it looks good. Baby is growing fine. Waiting on my fetal heart screening next week and the late anatomy in 2 weeks. I refused to have the amino fone because of the miscarriage risks. What is your opinion in my Case? Thank you so much.  (Even with all the results looking okay I’m still worried about the soft mark)         Mark Leach  says:    November 13, 2017 at 12:05 pm     The Harmony test result trumps any other screen for Down syndrome/T21. If the Harmony test resulted screen negative for T21, then the soft marker should not be considered an indicator of T21. An option few are counseled about is that you could have another cell free DNA screen like Harmony done. cfDNA screens improve in accuracy as the pregnancy progresses; if that second cfDNA screen was screen negative, then it would be incredibly unlikely that it would be a false negative. Usually, though, a second cfDNA screen must be paid out of pocket.           Lita Solstice  says:    December 19, 2017 at 12:49 pm     My mothers doctor recommended she abort me and my sister on the basis we ‘might’ have downs syndrome. Both born 9 yrs apart. Both born healthy babies. This is in Canada. What scares me is to think how many healthy babies are gone because of this recommendation. How many mothers traumatized by losing a baby. The stress and toll this takes on anyone who loses a child is a lot. My mother had already lost a child in womb and she was not willing to lose another. Her doctors told her with me I’d have downs and a hole in my heart and I wouldn’t survive out of womb. They were wrong. She called me her miracle child, because despite everything the doctors told her, she had me, and I was healthy baby. So knowing how unlikely it would be to have a child with downs, especially in your twenties, it makes me worry about how many precious lives we lose because of a doctors recommendation.         Monique  says:    February 17, 2018 at 8:49 am     Hi Mark, I know it’s been about a year since you’ve been up here but I stumbled across your article and it seems to be very informative. Even the responses you have given to the other commenters. My questions is this…. I recently did the blood work for all 3 chromosomal testing and everything came back negative it was 99.9% but when I had my ultrasound at 19weeks the doctor stated that my daughter has a short nasal bone and now my chances are 1/500. Ever since then I’ve been extremely worried crying every night. Can you please share some insight on this maybe to relieve some of my stress. They told me to talk to genetics but I just don’t want to go through an amnio and my baby is fine. Please help!!!         Mark Leach  says:    February 17, 2018 at 9:38 am     According to current professional guidelines, cell free DNA screening trumps any ultrasound soft marker like short nasal bone.

 My risk factor was 1 in 14. My AFP levesl and HCG were very high. I had a level II ultrasound and they were no indicators. I also had an amnio. I cried and stress for two weeks, and today I got my results. My baby does not have down syndrome. So please try not to worry. My risk was very high and my baby's chromosomes are normal. I wish you the best of luck!                 firstbabymama    Answered 10/1/07               108 found this helpful     Im sure there is nothing to worry about. I tested positive for down syndrome and my risk was 1 in 167. So I have been doing a lot of research on the Screening test. Most women who have positive screenings have healthy babies. Look at it this way your chances of having a baby with down syndrome is very slim. 1/197 means that there is a 99.5% chance that your baby does not have down syndrome. Thats not bad odds at all. Have you had a level II ultrasound done? Because they can check for markers on the baby, and if none are present it can make your risk even lower. I had one done and no markers were found. My risk went down to 1/350. It can be very reasuring when no markers are found on the ultrasound. Well good luck to you Im sure there is nothing to be scared of!              Anonymous   Answered 9/16/07               71 found this helpful     I understand what it feels like to live with that fear. After a similar test, my husband and I decided to have further tests. In the end we had a positive diagnosis and we are now know that we are expecting a baby girl with Down syndrome. I think having half the information was worse than all the information. We have been doing research to understand Down syndrome better and have found that this is not a terrible diagnosis. These babies may reach milestones a little later but hey, life is not a race. They may also have some health challenges but so can any baby. These children can contribute to their world very well. It is nothing to be afraid of. HOWEVER, I do recommend if you are paralyzed by your vague diagnosis. Have further tests and then do your research. You never know how you may feel once you are informed fully.

I also got the call at work from my doctor saying the quad screen had tested positive for downs and I was hysterical until I met with the genetic councelor the next day. My odds were 1 in 204, which in percentage terms was like only a .5% chance he had it (or in other words, a 99.5% chance he didn't!). We then had the ultrasound and found he had a short femur which brought the odds to 1 in 136, still less than a 1% chance. Decided not to have the amnio and just be positive instead, we'd have the baby regardless so what's the point? Anyway, I had a completely healthy bouncing baby boy. I was kicking myself later for worrying so much, I will never have that quad test again, the margin for error is ridiculous! Good luck and enjoy the pregnancy!                 kmdmom72    Answered 12/11/07               62 found this helpful     For others reading, I wanted to share our good news -- I'm the 39 year old who was told I had a 1 in 11 risk. The results came yesterday, and our little girl is 100% healthy! 46 chromosomes....NORMAL!! We are so totally thrilled and relieved! Again, if you are over 35 and are encouraged to get the amnio, reconsider the 2nd trimester triple or quad screening blood work (all 4 of my markers indicated elevated risk), and go straight for the definitive results of the amnio. If you're worried about the risks of the amnio, I took 2 days off from work, and had my husband walk the dog for a week -- I really allowed by body to recover. Best of luck to all you mothers!              Anonymous   Answered 11/8/07               44 found this helpful     My risk factor was 1 in 5, so I had CVS to find out the truth. My risk level is by far the highest among the readers here, but my result came back negative. My baby is normal! So I just want to encourage those who have better risk level than mine. A lot of times the test result come back normal despite it is 1/5 or 1/200. Hope this will ease some of your mind.                 anchiingrid    Answered 8/17/09               42 found this helpful     I too tested (not positive) but at a higher risk for Down Syndrome. I think it is important to distinguish that you are not positive for the syndrome you just have an increased chance for this. i have two boys 10 and 6. This yest was not even offered to me when i was pregnant with them. To my surprise the doctor called and told me my elevated risk was 1:175. After much research and genetic counselling i have decided not to have the amnio done. the risk is around the same for miscarriage from the amnio. I have read much about these tests recently and would never have them done again.It is so uncertain, you may have this....but it doesn't mean you do. I mean even a negative result does not mean you won't have a child with DS. I feel confident that the odds are not against you or myself and after researching Down Syndrome alot I found that most families with child with DS praised their children and thought their lives better for it. Many children with DS have jobs and live &quot;normal&quot; lives.                 shadylady    Answered 10/17/07               38 found this helpful     I need the truth I am pregnant or at least I was up until I had my 10 weeks positive down syndrome test on the 12th of this month. I am heartbroken. I am waiting until next weekand requesting another test before they do something. i am sorry for asking. I am desperate                 kissesmany    Answered 2/24/17               36 found this helpful     My wife tested positive for Down Syndrome. Her risk was 1 in 243. The doctor scheduled us in for a Level II ultrasound and to speak with a geneticist. The ultrasound did not show and soft markers, so the doctor said we didn't need to do anymore testing if we felt comfortable with what we had seen and heard. For our own peace of mind, we went ahead with the amniocentesis. The procedure did not take very long and my wife said it did not hurt that much. Well, we got the results back yesterday and everything was fine! Our baby girl has the right number of chromosomes. It's only natural to worry if your blood test indicates a possibility for DS, but remember most women will have normal babies. We are just one more couple who have proven this to be the case.

People with Down syndrome may have physical problems, learning problems and distinct physical features.    Many people with Down syndrome are healthy, but some need medical care for birth defects or other health conditions.    Talk to your health care provider or a genetic counselor to learn about testing for Down syndrome.         What is Down syndrome?    Down syndrome (also called trisomy 21) is the most common chromosomal condition in the United States. A chromosomal condition happens when there’s a problem in one or more chromosomes. Chromosomes are the structures that hold genes. Genes are part of your body’s cells that store instructions for the way your body grows and works.  About 1 in 700 babies (less than 1 percent) is born with Down syndrome. Many children with Down syndrome lead healthy, active lives. They go to school, play sports and enjoy being social with others. A person with Down syndrome may live 60 years or more.     What causes Down syndrome?    Each person has 23 pairs of chromosomes in every cell in their body. For each pair, you get one chromosome from your mother and one chromosome from your father. Babies with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21. This extra copy changes the way the brain and body develop.  We don’t know for sure why Down syndrome happens. It may be that the egg or sperm that come together in fertilization has an extra chromosome. Fertilization is when a man’s sperm gets inside a woman’s egg to make her pregnant. One kind of Down syndrome (called translocation Down syndrome) can be passed from a parent to a child, but it’s rare.     Your age when you get pregnant affects your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. The older you are, the higher your risk. If you get pregnant:   At age 25, your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is 1 in 1,340.  At age 30, your risk is 1 in 940.  At age 35, your risk is 1 in 353.  At age 40, your risk is 1 in 85.  At age 45, your risk is 1 in 35.   If you already have a baby with Down syndrome, your risk for having another increases with each pregnancy. Up to age 40, for each pregnancy your chances of having another baby with Down syndrome is about 1 in 100 (1 percent). After age 40, the risk is based your age. Talk to a genetic counselor to understand your risk. A genetic counselor is a person who is trained to help you understand about genes, birth defects and other medical conditions that run in families and how they can affect your health and your baby's health.    What are the different kinds of Down syndrome?  There are three kinds of Down syndrome:   Trisomy 21. This is the most common kind. About 95 in 100 people with Down syndrome (95 percent) have trisomy 21. In this condition, your baby’s cells have three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two.  Mosaic Down syndrome. People with this condition have some cells with three copies of chromosome 21, but other cells have the usual two copies. Mosaic Down syndrome is rare. People with Mosaic Down syndrome may have fewer characteristics of Down syndrome because they have some cells with the two copies of chromosome 21.  Translocation Down syndrome. This condition happens when a person has two copies of chromosome 21, plus an extra part of a chromosome or a whole extra chromosome that’s attached (also called translocated) to one copy of chromosome 21. This condition is rare, and it can be inherited (passed from parent to child).     Can you find out during pregnancy if your baby has Down syndrome?    Yes. Health care providers offer testing for Down syndrome to all pregnant women as part of regular prenatal care (medical care during pregnancy). You can decide if you want to have these tests. Talk to your health care provider or a genetic counselor about testing for Down syndrome.  If you or your partner has a family history of Down syndrome, tell your health care provider or genetic counselor. Family history means that someone in either of your families has the condition. Use our family health history form to help you find out if certain health conditions run in your families.      There are two kinds of prenatal tests to check for Down syndrome:     Screening tests. These tests check if your baby is more likely than others to have Down syndrome. There are no risks to you or your baby when you have a screening test, but they don’t tell you for sure if your baby has a condition like Down syndrome.  Diagnostic tests. These tests tell you for sure if your baby does or doesn’t have Down syndrome. If a screening test shows your baby is at high risk of Down syndrome, your provider may recommend a diagnostic test to confirm the results.      Each kind of test has pros and cons. Screening test results can help you decide if you want to have a diagnostic test. You may or may not want to know for sure during pregnancy if your baby has Down syndrome. If you do find out for sure, you can learn about the condition so you’re prepared when your baby’s born. You also can make plans to give birth in a hospital that can give your baby special medical care .  What screening tests are used for Down syndrome?  Screening tests are called noninvasive because your provider doesn’t need to use tools that break your skin or enter your body. Instead, you get a blood test or an ultrasound. Ultrasound is a prenatal test that uses sound waves and a computer screen to show a picture of your baby inside the womb.     Screening tests for Down syndrome include:     First trimester screening (also called first trimester combined test). Your provider uses these test results and your age to estimate your chances of having a baby with Down syndrome. This test is usually done at 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. It has two parts:​    Blood test. This measures levels of plasma protein-A (also called PAPP-A) and a pregnancy hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (also called HCG) in your blood. If your PAPP-A and HCG levels aren’t normal, your baby may have Down syndrome.  Nuchal translucency test . Your provider uses this special kind of ultrasound to measure the tissue at the back of your baby’s neck (called the nuchal fold). Extra fluid in the nuchal fold may be a sign that your baby may have Down syndrome.          Integrated screening test. Your provider uses these two tests to estimate the chances that your baby has Down syndrome: ​    First trimester. You get a blood test to check your PAPP-A levels and an ultrasound to measure your baby’s nuchal fold. This test is usually done at 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy.​  Second trimester. You get a maternal blood test (also called quad screen) to measure four substances in your blood: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), estriol, HCG and inhibin A. The test is usually done at 15 to 22 weeks of pregnancy.      Cell-free DNA testing (also called noninvasive prenatal screening or testing or NIPT). This test checks your blood for your baby’s DNA to see if he may have Down syndrome. You can have this test as early as 9 weeks of pregnancy. If you’re at high risk of having a baby with Down syndrome, your provider may recommend this test. It’s not recommended if you aren't likely to have a baby with a birth defect or if you’re pregnant with multiples (more than one baby, like twins or triplets).         What diagnostic tests are used for Down syndrome?    If a diagnostic test for Down syndrome is positive, it means your baby has the condition. If it’s negative, your baby doesn’t have Down syndrome. Diagnostic tests are called invasive because your provider uses a needle to take a sample of your baby’s blood, amniotic fluid or tissue for testing. There is a risk of miscarriage with diagnostic tests. Miscarriage is when a baby dies in the womb before 20 weeks of pregnancy.     Diagnostic tests for Down syndrome include:     Amniocentesis (also called amnio). This test takes some amniotic fluid from around your baby in the uterus (also called womb) to check for Down syndrome. You can get an amnio at 15 to 20 weeks of pregnancy.  Chorionic villus sampling (also called CVS). This test checks tissue from the placenta to see if a baby has Down syndrome. You can get CVS at 10 to 13 weeks of pregnancy.  Cordocentesis (also called percutaneous umbilical cord sampling or PUBS). Your provider inserts a thin needle into an umbilical cord vein to take a small sample of your baby’s blood to check for chromosome defects. You can get this test between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. There’s a much greater risk of miscarriage with cordocentesis than with amnio or CVS, so you only get this test if other tests are unclear and your provider can’t confirm your baby has Down syndrome any other way.       How are babies with Down syndrome diagnosed after birth?    After birth, your baby’s provider gives your baby a physical exam and checks for common physical characteristics of Down syndrome. To confirm your baby has Down syndrome, she sends a sample of your baby’s blood to a lab for testing.  What are some physical characteristics of a person with Down syndrome?  A person with Down syndrome may have distinct physical characteristics, including:  Facial features. Most babies with Down syndrome have some, but not all of these characteristics:   A flattened face, with a flat nose  Almond-shaped eyes that slant up  A small mouth  A tongue that may stick out of the mouth  Tiny white spots on the iris (colored part) of the eye       Other physical characteristics. Babies and children with Down syndrome may have some of these characteristics:     A short neck  Small hands and feet. They also may have a single line across the center of the palm of the hand (also called a palmar crease) or small pinky fingers that curve towards the thumb.  Small ears that may fold over a little at the top  Low muscle tone (also called hypotonia) or loose joints. Babies with Down syndrome have low muscle tone at birth. They may seem floppy and have poor head control.  Short height       How does Down syndrome affect your child’s health and development?    Most people with Down syndrome are healthy, but some need special medical care. Common health and development problems in people with Down syndrome include:      Congenital heart defects . These are heart conditions a baby’s born with that can affect the heart’s shape or how it works, or both. About half of babies with Down syndrome have congenital heart defects. Like all babies, babies with Down syndrome get heart screening as part of newborn screening tests before they leave the hospital after birth. Babies with Down syndrome also get checked by a pediatric cardiologist, a doctor who treats babies and children with heart problems. If your baby has a congenital heart defect, treatment may include taking medicines or having heart surgery.  Hearing loss . This is when your baby can’t hear sound in one or both ears. About 3 in 4 babies with Down syndrome (75 percent) have hearing loss. Like all babies, babies with Down syndrome get screened for hearing loss as part of newborn screening. Your baby also needs follow-up hearing tests every 6 months and may need to see an ear, nose and throat (also called ENT) doctor who specializes in treating babies and children (called a pediatric ENT). Your baby may need ear tubes. These are tiny tubes placed through the ear drum to allow air into the middle ear and prevent fluids from building up behind the ear drum.  Intellectual and developmental disabilities. These are problems with how the brain works that can cause a person to have trouble or delays in physical development, learning, communicating, taking care of himself or getting along with others. Babies with Down syndrome may reach developmental milestones later than other babies. A developmental milestone is a skill or activity that most children can do at a certain age. Milestones include sitting, walking, talking, having social skills and having thinking skills. Getting early intervention services as soon as possible can help improve your baby’s development. The services can help children from birth through 3 years learn important skills, like how to talk, walk and interact with others. To find out about early intervention services in your state, visit the Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center .  Sleep disorders, like obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is when your child’s breathing stops and starts during sleep because her airway becomes narrow or blocked. Snoring is the most common sign of obstructive sleep apnea. Children with sleep apnea often have larger tonsils and adenoids than other children. Tonsils and adenoids are lymph tissues near the throat that help protect the body from infection. All children with Down syndrome should be checked for obstructive sleep apnea during an overnight sleep study in a hospital before they’re 4 years old. Your child wears sensors, and a team of health care providers checks your child’s breathing, blood oxygen levels and brain waves while she sleeps. Treatment for sleep disorders may include wearing a mask to help your child breathe during sleep or surgery to remove your child’s tonsils and adenoids.  Vision problems. More than half of children with Down syndrome have vision problems. An eye doctor called a pediatric ophthalmologist checks your baby’s vision at birth and at 1 year. Children with Down syndrome need regular eye exams. She may need glasses, surgery or other treatments to help improve her vision.   Some children with Down syndrome have other conditions, including:   Blood disorders. Your baby gets yearly blood tests to check for problems, like low iron or anemia. Anemia is when you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the rest of your body. It’s rare, but some children with Down syndrome may have a blood cancer called leukemia. These children are treated by a pediatric hematologist-oncologist, a doctor who treats children with blood disorders and cancer. They may need chemotherapy (medicines used to treat cancer).  Dental problems. Your baby may develop teeth more slowly, in a different order or have fewer teeth than other children.  Infections. Babies with Down syndrome tend to get sick often because their bodies have trouble fighting off infections. Make sure your baby gets all of her vaccinations on time. Vaccinations help protect your baby from certain diseases.  Microcephaly . This is a birth defect in which a baby’s head is smaller than expected, compared to babies of the same sex and age. Some babies with microcephaly have smaller brains that may not develop properly. To diagnose microcephaly if your baby has Down syndrome, your baby’s provider measures your baby’s head circumference and compares it to other babies with Down syndrome who have microcephaly. Head circumference is the distance around your baby’s head.  Low muscle tone. Babies with low muscle tone may have trouble with sucking, feeding, weight gain and bowel movements. If your baby has poor muscle tone, she may have delays in meeting developmental milestones, like rolling over, sitting up, crawling and walking.  Problems with the intestines, like Hirschsprung disease. The intestines are long tubes that are part of your body’s digestive system. Your digestive system helps your body break down food, take in nutrients and remove waste. Hirschsprung disease happens when the large intestine (also called the colon) is blocked. Babies with Hisrchsprung disease need surgery to remove part of colon that isn’t working well.  Neck or spine problems. Bones in the neck or spine can be unstable and increase your child’s risk of spinal cord injury. Some children need surgery.  Thyroid problems. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that makes hormones (chemicals) that help the body use and store energy. Babies with Down syndrome may have low thyroid hormone levels. If not treated, this can affect your baby’s growth and development. Your baby gets checked for thyroid problems as part of newborn screening and has follow-up tests every year. Thyroid problems are treated with medicine.

How Frequently Does Down Syndrome Occur? Down Syndrome (formerly called mongolism), named after Dr. Langdon Down, who described these children in 1866, occurs in one out of seven hundred births. The chance of having a Down Syndrome baby increases with the age of the mother. Women under age 23—1 in 2,000 births Women at age 30—1 in 1,300 births Women at age 35—1 in 400 births Women at age 40—1 in 90 births Women at age 45—1 in 32 births Women at age 50—1 in 8 births Depending on how they are presented, these figures can be scary. If a doctor says to a mother, “At age thirty-five you have five times the chance of having a Down Syndrome baby than you did at age twenty,” that would scare many senior mothers from conceiving. Here’s how I present the risk factors to my patients who ask. At age twenty you had a 99.95 percent chance of not delivering a baby with Down syndrome; at age thirty-five your chances of not delivering a baby with Down Syndrome are 99.75 percent. Doesn’t that figure sound more reassuring? This is why, in my opinion, the “thirty-five-year-old scare” is too young, forty-five perhaps? Even at age forty-five you have a 97 percent chance of delivering a baby without Down Syndrome. So, for mothers of later childbearing age, these figures are looking up.   Because of these risk factors, we believe that it is unwarranted to scare a thirty-five-year-old mother into prenatal diagnostic tests (either amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling). Weigh these facts: At age thirty-five your statistical chance of delivering a Down Syndrome baby is 0.25 percent. However, the risk of damage to a normal preborn baby during these tests may be around 1 percent. At present, the AFP (alpha fetal protein) test is inaccurate for the prenatal diagnosis of Down Syndrome and is a source of much needless worry to pregnant parents. Whether or not you have a prenatal diagnostic testing is an individual judgment call between you and your doctor. But remember, your doctor is legally obligated to offer these tests to any mother thirty-five years of age or older. Related Articles Why does Down Syndrome Occur?

I'm not sure if it was the blood work or the ultrasound. During ultra sound tech had a hard time measuring the neck bc the baby wouldn't move she said she was off by a millimeter. She tried for 45 minutes to get the perfect measurement. I don't know what to think but doc is sending me for the cvs Monday. I'm not sure why I can't do the NIpT blood test instead.

T  TinaYouFatLard @TinaYouFatLard  There is always possibilities that what they say is wrong. Just have hope and pray and remember your baby is a blessing :) A  AnnelXo Pray & have faith!

Sometimes God tests your faith in mysterious ways. m  mrsalbertson1 I was told the exact same thing when I was pregnant with my daughter I was 18 and scared to death. They sent me to a 3d ultrasound that did all the measurements and said everything looked fine so they gave me the option of amniocentesis or giving birth to her without knowing a hundred percent. she's now 3 years old and perfectly fine no sign of Down syndrome whatsoever a  arod2782 @AnnelXo  Thank you!!!!!!!! m  meena1215 @arod2782  I think you should ask about non-invasive testing. I don't think that cvs or amnio is a must at this point. It's your choice about what to do next. You can also wait for the 18-20 week anatomy US. Don't stress though! It could be a mistake. j  jellybaby85 I did amnio in my last pregnancy and the procedure went fine... It's the only way to know with certainty that the baby does or doesn't have downs or another trisomy. Doing another test like harmony/ nipd or whatever it is will only give you another percentage risk... No definitive answer. For us, we had to know so having no wasn't even a decision we had to considers. If you feel you need to know too, cvs or amnio is the way to go. I'm not going to try give false hope because there is a chance baby could have a trisomy and as hard as it is, you need to be prepared for that possibility although I hope and pray that this is not the case for you. Thinking of you as I truly know how hard this situation is. Xx K  Kstewart1978 @arod2782  I am.... I'm freaking out and scared. The sono said thickened neck and the numbers are not in a normal range. I took the blood test and waiting before I decide the amnio. I can't think straight A  AvryanasMom I know it's hard but I honestly would try not to stress too much at this point... Only because I had to have that test repeated with my daughter (first pregnancy) because the ultrasound tech couldn't get a good measurement the first time because she was moving too much. Hope everything turns out ok. h  hyperballad4 @arod2782  I found out yesterday that I was high risk as well but luckily I had paid to have the NIPT test as well and got them back and no DS. That test is 99% accurate. I would recommend it if you can get it. You still have a 75% chance everything will work out, so keep hope alive, those are good odds. Congrats! B  BEE999 @arod2782  Hello, I am 28 and also received a positive screening (1 in 71). Apparently my papp-a was very low. I have an appt with a genetic counselor next week. I really hope I dont have to do the amnio. U should also talk with a genetic counselor before doing anything. A  ACH271988 I know someone that was told their daughter would be born with Downs and she was born completely normal. I know it's horrible news but that baby will be a blessing to you. a  arod2782 @jellybaby85  Yes I want to know for sure bc As hard as it will be My husband and I agreed on not continuing with the pregnancy. But there's also a chance if miscarriage but I'm doomed either way. No easy way out for this one. So devastating. a  arod2782 @Kstewart1978  Why didn't they have the blood work with your NT? They should've told you when they had both results. How high were your numbers? You're not alone. How far along are you? Bc you can do the cvs up to 13 weeks 6days. a  arod2782 @hyperballad4  But isn't the NIPT a screening just like the NT? I don't want another screening for risk factor I want a diagnostic to be sure that either there is or isn't Down syndrome. a  ababystory2 @arod2782  Try not to worry too much! You still have a 3 in 4 chance of having a normal child. And while we all want the healthiest baby possible, there will be nothing "wrong" if you have a downs kiddo. He/she would simply be different! Downs kids are so precious and sweet. Every child is beautiful in their own way. :) N  NicoleColbert @arod2782  Even if your baby is born with downs, it's a journey. They are amazing and sweet children. We personally wouldn't bat an eye lash over having a baby with downs. a  acidowly @arod2782  There's always hope! but if your child has downs I know you won't love him/her any less :) kids with downs are the sweetest most compassionate kids, and although they have hard time with something's, they are amazing at others. I know a girl who has downs and in high school kids would make fun of her, and one day she told the kids off. Now she's a life guard because she's an amazing swimmer! So even if your baby does has downs look at it as a blessing because you were blessed with a miracle either way :) Related Articles & Discussions 4 Ways the GOP Tax Plan Could Hurt Families  The tax plan provides short-term relief for most families — but long-term pain.

If you're able to find it, you'll see a lot of feedback I got from others. I was also told on Saturday that I'm high risk for a Down syndrome baby. It caught me completely off guard as I was thinking I was fine because I am 29. My readings came back as a 1 out of 228 chance. I'm still worried and waiting for my ultrasound on the 23rd where I find out baby's gender and where they'll be looking for markers that indicate Down syndrome.

We chose to have an amino done so that we can be prepared. We just moved from Chicago to a small town in Michigan so if there was something wrong, I wanted to know what resources were available to us. My amino results came back last week and our girl is totally fine! False positives with these tests are a lot higher than they advertise. I'm also going to be donating part of my placenta to the lab so that they can analyze it to see what may have gone wrong. Anything I can do to help other women not have to go through this, is totally worth it to me. b  brandddyyyy @Lexi1031  Yours came back 99% positive for downs?? Wow!!

Just that they were 99% sure that the lab results indicated an extra chromosome. My husband and I were devastated and we're so glad we did the amnio to get the diagnostic results. b  brandddyyyy @Lexi1031  Wow! I'm glad everything turned out alright! b  btterfli2003 I have a 1/43 ratio and I decided not to get an amino or placenta testing. I have been very stressed out about everything bc I really don't know what's going on. I was told I could have a level 2 ultrasound but not until 19 weeks. My doctor reminded me I could still get an abortion then which made me upset. Hopefully everything is Ok but this has turned my pregnancy into a very stressful situation when it should be the exact opposite. m  mouzamaz I have been told by the doctor that I got chance of 1/300 to have DS baby.. Is it a positive or negative ratio.. ? b  babythunberg @kellycrosland1980  I'm 35 and a FTM. The first screening completed came back at 1/187 of DS. I freaked out! Until I did further research and found out that the test is a screening it is not based solely on your blood work. Your age has a high factor in the results. I had the next blood panel test completed. The results came back perfectly fine. My baby does not have DS. I bet your baby is fine. It's your age putting you at a higher risk. s  superdee74 I had the CVS test done at 12 weeks. I was a little scared. They put a needle in my tummy to get a sample of my placenta. It didn't hurt and was a very fast procedure. We had the results within 7 days. We found out the results for close to 200 diseases including downs and cystic fibrosis. The results came back negative. I am 41 and high risk so we chose to by pass the blood screening and do this test. We wanted to know early so instead of being surprised later in we could prepare ourselves for what was to come if there were any health problems. It wa totally worth it and I slept better at night. I would recommend any mommy to bo to do this test just for peace of mind. Praying for healthy babies for all of us! :) B  Babydoll72 I did screening as well since i am 43. I was shocked to hear it was all low risk. What i have heard alot though, is there is a lot of false positives. So might want to be prepared but take it with a grain of salt. Your quad screening can show alot more too. L  Littleflower1981 dear kelly - it must be stressful. I personally would have gone the amnio route, but I completely understand if you don't want to. Remember that these are "SCREENING" test and not DIAGNOSTIC (the amnio is diagnostic). Screening tests gives you a probability that the baby has down syndrome, they detect potential disease indicators. Diagnostic test is yes or no - they establish presence/absence of disease. So even if the test came out 1/107, it also comes with accuracy level (which depends on the test; panorama test is higher than the regular bloodwork) which means that this 1/107 results has also a probability (of about 20% (bloodwork) to 1% (panorama) depending on test) to be wrong. I wish you, your husband and your baby all the best. L  Littleflower1981 @Lexi1031  Yes! donate to science is SO important (I am a scientist). I will donate my blood cord - if everything goes well - for the exact reason. Do it, girls! do it! J  JazzyJac @mouzamaz  That depends on a lot of factors, most importantly your age. You should ask your doctor. L  Littleflower1981 @mouzamaz  you should ask your doctor for more explanation. The "normal" ratio depends on a lot of thing (so 1/300 could be normal for someone but high for someone else). my "base" ratio (i am 34 white healty) was about 1/380, and the panorama test came back with 1/10000 (which is just a way for them to say very unlikely). As I said before, these are screening tests which give a probability of syndrome, and they have an accuracy too. It can be hard to grasp the limit of these tests for people who are not handy with statistic (i work with statistic) so I understand why they generate confusion. But again, you should talk with your doctor and get more info about what your rate is compared to your base one. Say your "base" level is 1/500, it means that the test gave you a slightly slightly higher change of risk of having the syndrome, but if your "Base" level is 1/380 (to say, like mine) the tests basically confirmed your base level. Even if I got my panorama test euqal to 1/10000 there is still the very low probability that indeed has some syndrome. The only certain way to know is tru diagnostic test, like amnio. (hope it helps!) m  mrshuntfarms My co worker had a false positive as well, kind of ruined her pregnancy experience b/c of the unnecessary worry. We have chosen not to have the testing done. This baby was a gift from God in the beginning, it is still a gift even if it is wrapped in a way we didn't expect.  m  mouzamaz @Littleflower1981  Thank you very much for your help.. I will do so and meet my doctor soon.. :) thnx again m  mouzamaz @JazzyJac  Thank you for your reply .. I will consider the age also.. :) Related Articles & Discussions Study: New Preeclampsia Screening Might Be More Accurate  Recent research has found that a new method for screening preeclampsia is easy, safe — and more accurate at identifying moms-to-be who are at the greatest risk. s High risk for down syndrome?

During my first pregnancy my baby was diagnosed with down syndrome,which was shocking to me as I was only 23 at the time and I had honestly never even considered it as a possibility. I am now pregnant again and I am terrified that it could happen to me again. I am four weeks away from the nuchal translucency us and I can't stop replaying the moment I received my upsetting news and imagining it happening again. I was just hoping that maybe someone out there has been through what I have been through and can share some stories about their pregnancy following one with a genetic abnormality. Thanks.

M  Mom2NicoleandFaith @Jess3787  As long as the baby has trisomy 21 then it was just a fluck and it really is rare for you to have more then one. If the baby has translocation then that means the gene came from one of the parents. My daughter with DS was 9 when I got preg with Faith and I chose not to have any testing besides the US because Nicole was a surprise and I didn't want to worry through my preg with Faith if something showed up. Faith was born "normal". I was 29 when I had Nicole and was almost 39 when I had Faith so who knows about age. I would not worry about it happening again. It is like lightning striking the same place twice, very rare! Good luck! J  Jess3787 Thank you to the both of you for sharing your stories. Although I know there is no way to know what the future holds for me it makes me feel better to know that there are others out there who have experienced what I have. B  Bellebk Dont worry and be happy, it doesnt need to happen again... Im sure this time it will be ok, last year i lost a pregnancy at 9w due cromosomal problems, Im 13w now and confident that this one is a keeper... m  mrsmatt10808 @Jess3787   Hey! I have twins who both have Down syndrome. They have trisomy 21 and we were told by a geneticist that it is really just a fluke (and a HUGE blessing!) and that the likelihood of a repeat are slim. That said- your odds DO go up slightly if you have already had a child with DS but I know so many moms who have had 1 with DS and 2 or 3 more without it. Either way, your baby is perfect. Good luck, try to stay calm.  W  Walkie I'm pregnant with my 2nd, my first born has special needs. Suspected chromosomal abnormality. It plays in the back of my mind obviously but we're so excited to be having another baby it doesn't consume me which I honestly thought it would.

This one I've been told has downs. :( so I think to put your mind at ease, the odds are in your favor. L  Lovepeacemama @Jess3787  Have you consulted with the genetic specialist they will tell you your odds after the blood test and NT. I assume you didn't keep the first baby or you would have read in all the down syndrome books that your chance before your blood test and NT is 1% or 1 in 100 for another baby with DS. L  Lovepeacemama @mrsmatt10808  Twins with DS that is amazing! How old are they? I know a lady who has 7 kids and two have DS(not twins though)and she always says she hit the genetic jackpot :) m  mrsmatt10808 @Lovepeacemama  Casey and Connor are 22 month old miracle men! We have found out the odds of identicals who both have DS is 1 or 2 in 1 million pregnancies! We really did hit the genetic jackpot! J  Jess3787 I have been fully aware since the beginning that my chances of a second child with down syndrome is 1% however having gone through the diagnosis the first time I also know that statistics mean absolutely nothing. I prefer to hear real life stories. D  Daydreamz82 I had test results come back at saying I have a 1/200 chance of having a child with Down Syndrome (trisomy 21) I opted out of having a amneo done as the odds of miscarriage during the procedure was the same odds even though the hospital & genetic specialists were pushing for us to have it done to "find out 100%" or not. When we had an ultrasound done at 20 weeks it showed no markers, it does not mean we are in the clear.

I am 26 and pregnant with my first as well. I have a 1/80 chance of having a baby with Downs. I opted out of getting the amnio but that was because I didn't want the added risk put on my pregnancy even though it is very minimal. I just figure that no matter the outcome, I will love my little boy just the same. I know how stressful it is and I feel for you. Best of luck to you and your baby. T  Tonyandkim2011 @kelli1087  It could be a false positive. I was 27 with my last and I had a false negative. They said the downs test came put negative. They were soo wrong. My perfect little man has downs. I know it's scary. If you ever need to talk feel free to message me. Good luck hope everything is great. M  Mom2NicoleandFaith @kelli1087  I was 28 when I got preg the first time and my odds where 1:800. My beautiful daughter Nicole was born with DS. At 38 I got preg for my second time and my odds where 1:100 and my daughter Faith was born "normal". Don't look at the numbers to much. I am glad I did not know til she was born because there is so much miss information out there. If you have the amnio and find out that your little one has DS, first just breathe and then research but new info not old. There are still doctors out there that are not updated with the most recent info. Either way enjoy your preg and remember that your baby will be perfect to you. No matter what. I am here if you ever need to talk. -  @kelli1087  Hi know how scary it can be waiting for these things.  I had almost the same thing happen to me a fwe weeks ago, except I screened positive for neural tube defects.  My odds were much higher than yours (1 in 13).  I had the ultrasound and they were able to rule out the NTD.  Yes, they offered me amnio as well, but it only gives us another 1-2% for certain, so we opted out.  It was my bloodwork that threw off the results (the fetal medicine specialist gave me 5 possible reasons!!).  There are so many things that can throw off the blood screening results.  You also need to remember (I know it's hard) that this is merely a "screening" and that your result says you only have a "higher than expected" chance.  Your odds of having a "normal" baby are still like 98-99% given your 1/67 guess.  Also, I have worked with a number of children with Downs - they are lovely, caring, affectionate kids, highly dependent on routine.  And despite previous thought, they are extremely capable and intelligent if early intervention is given.  Remember, you have a much higher chance of delivering a healthy "normal" baby than not, but it's never easy to sit and wait for an answer.  Try to relax and know that there is nothing you can/can't do right now.  I'm thinking of you and hoping you get the results you're looking for soon. k  kelli1087 @mmm_lovett2053478892  Thank you! Â That made me feel better! B  Battlestar @kelli1087  I have friends with DS children. Most children with downs have parents under the age of 25. They love their cuties and their other children are fine. But what a stress. I hope that everything works out and wish you the best of luck. b  babycaper @kelli1087  Well we have a heart defect and it could have been downs or digeorge syndrome, so we opted for the amnio.  I hated the feeling of it!  I had no idea what it would feel like.. so if you want to know read on, otherwise don't :) The first skin *** was just like a blood test, but when they punctured the sac it was a little burning/stinging sensation, but only mildly hurt for the second it punctured.  I was pretty sore right after and for the next day or so.. as if I had a big abs workout and the muscles were sore.  Hubby helped a lot by pulling me up and you shouldn't really carry anything heavy.  I didn't have any complications with it.. Good luck with the testing!  Really the waiting is the worst part.. it took us 3 days to get the down's results and 3 weeks to get the digeorge D  Dutunka @kelli1087   Hi, I had similar results to yours few weeks ago. after quad screen I got 1:50 chance for Downs. I was crying, and crying and crying... I wasn't sure why it happened with me. I'm 28. My OB sent me to genetic counseling, I decided to do amnio without any doubt, because the risk of having baby with Downs was higher than miscarriage after amnio. From my personal experience my amnio was easy, I didn't feel practically anything. The waiting is the worst. I declined to get FISH results as I needed to know final and accurate results. I got them on September 22nd and they told me everything is fine, no Downs or any of trisomy problems or neural defects. I went through anatomy u/s a week after, and everything seems to be fine also. If you want to know for sure and have some piece of mind - I suggest you to go through amnio. But it is really your own decision. For me it was out of the question, I wanted to do amnio no matter what, I would do it even if the odds were 1:100, it's just the person I am, I need to know for sure. They told me that amnio is about 99 % accurate, my OB actually told me 100 %. So I'm praying for healthy baby. We didn't want to find out the sex of the baby, it's a surprise. Good luck to you !  k  kelli1087 @Dutunka  I'm so happy for you. Â No one should have to go through their whole pregnancy not knowing for sure. Â I couldn't imagine having to deal with what I have been over that last week for the rest of my pregnancy! Â Your post really made me feel a lot more at ease with all of this. Â Thank you soo much!! Â I go in tomorrow to get my second u/s and genetic counseling. Â So I hope that brings a little more reassurance until the amnio. Â Also you said that you didn't get the FISH results done. Â Are they not as accurate as the amnio results? a  alexfoodie @kelli1087  Fish are accurate but do not test for everything. However, every lab is different in what they offer/ timeframes. I had a cvs at 12.5 weeks and the fish tested for 21, 13 and 18 while the full tested the remainder of the chromosomes. I had an amnio last year which the fish confirmed 13 and the full only reconfirmed the littany of problems. Good luck! D  Dutunka @kelli1087  The reason I dodn't want to get FISH results is because I've been told by genetic counselor that there were cases that final results and FISH did not match. It doesn't happen very often, but it is possible though. So i thought... "What the heck ? Why should I worry twice?" I'd rather wait two weeks, but get final and accurate results. And I waited exactly 2 weeks and 1 day. it was a nightmare believe me, a lot of sleepless nights for me. But, thanks God, everything came back fine. I'm still suspicious though and probably will be until Valentine's Day (it's when my baby is due), but I think it's normal for every Mom to be. But not as worried though as I was before I didn't know the results of the tests. I wish you all the luck and believe with all my heart that you will get great news too ! k  kelli1087 @Dutunka  I went for my level 2 u/s and genetic counseling today. Â I think it went well. Â The doctor came in and told me that there were no markers for DS and that he strongly believed my baby is 100% healthy. Â He changed my 1/67 to about 1/140. Â This made me and my family a lot more at ease. Â However, just to make sure, i went ahead with the amnio. Â He said that the FISH results would come in tomorrow afternoon at the earliest and friday morning at the latest. Â I am still worried (less than before). Â I am currently just taking it easy and hoping for the best. Â This whole experience has made me really appreciate everything in my life. Â I have read a few stories from people saying that they also showed no markers on the level 2 u/s and their baby still ended up with DS. Â So we aren't in the clear just yet. Â But we are certainly feeling better than before. Â I  Imjme @kelli1087  Hi Kelli087- did you get your FISH results yet? If you find out that you are having a baby with down syndrome, please feel free to message me'. My 2 yr old has down syndrome. I will be happy to answer any questions you might have. I will tell you that he us such a joy. I made a canvass with his picture that says "you are my sonshine", and he is! :) k  kelli1087 @Imjme  Yes, we got the results back friday afternoon and everything was normal.  This past week has been the most stressful week of my life.  This is my first baby and I'm 22.  This whole experience has just made me so thankful for everything I have taken for granted in the past.  I have done so much research and read so many stories on the internet about down syndrome.  And I've realized this really can happen to anyone, no matter the age or background.  I know I would love my baby either way.  Any child is a gift.  I have been looking into volunteer work for disabled children and adults.  I really feel as though I should do something to help others.  And I know it shouldn't take something like this to happen for me to realize that.  The important thing is I have definitely opened my eyes to reality and want to give back.  I just want to thank everyone for all the comforting stories and advice they have given to me over this past week.  Thank you! T  Tonyandkim2011 @Imjme  I just wanted to agree with you. My baby is 15 months with downs and he is the best thing that has ever happened to my family. I couldn't imagine life without him. We are so lucky so have such precious children in our lives. T  Tonyandkim2011 @kelli1087  I'm happy your results are great. Working with disabled children is a wonderful way to give back.

I am really glad that I did not have any clue that she would have it because I would have worried about so much and there has been alot of things that she has not had. So the only advice I can give you is to try and ease up on the worrying because you never know what will happen. Even if the amnio comes back positive, your baby is individual and can have a great life. Our daughter did not have any heart problems and she is in a regular school! Yes she does almost 50 percent of the time in a special ed class getting one on one help but she is included in everything. She does dance and girl scouts!!! So I hope I have help alittle and you can write me anytime if you have any questions. Good luck! R  Rosymom @shereem  Hi there. First, hugs to you!  I also had the quad screening and was given a 1:10 chance of downs and 1:30 chance of the other trisomy.  We chose not to have an amnio.  We would love this baby and keep this baby no matter what.  Our daughter was born 4 weeks ago and she is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!  No downs or not a thing wrong with her. We were scared too, and were fearful the entire pregnancy, but gave that to God. He gave us this baby and we knew that whatever happened was supposed to be.  My chances were worse than yours, and on the boards I never found anyone that had the chances I did. I hope this helps.  If you have anymore questions, let me know.  Or if I can help. B  BackforMore @shereem  Hi there. I know this is scary, but when you do the math, that's still only a 3% chance, which is pretty low! I have heard from lots of others whose tests were "positive" and yet the baby was completely fine at birth. I know you will worry, anyway, but everything will most likely be fine! Good luck and hugs to you. m  mrs_gtyjno1 @shereem  Hello, First of all, don't let the numbers scare you 1/32 is only 3%... and even for a mother aged 49 the odds only go up to 1/12 which is only an 8% chance of DS. The facts are that the odds are much higher in your favor that the baby will be normal. So, don't let the screenings and tests scare you. If the weatherman told you there was an 3 to 8% chance of rain, you probably wouldn't take your umbrella, right? Now, that isn't to say it isn't possible... but worry won't help you or the baby... plus, amnio is not without its risks. IF there is a problem.. do you want to add stress by worrying about the complications from amnio? There is a 2% chance of miscarriage too... which is about the same as your odds for DS (though at your age, it is still HIGHLY unlikely). There is also the risk of premature labor, infection, and a contaminated specimen. A lot of OBs and specialists don't mention how many amnios they have to repeat or get false results from either.... but there is potential for contamination of the fluid with too many of the mother's cells also. Basically in an amnio the fluid is composed of cells from the baby, the mother, the placenta.. most dead.. but they HOPE for enough living cells to centrifuge and then test. Many times they can collect enough information to ease a mother's fears, but sometimes they cannot. The best use for amnio is near the end of pregnancy if trying to determine lung maturity in case of an early delivery... then, if complications ensue, the baby is nearer term and safer, especially if it triggers labor (which it can do).  Any time an amnio is done there is a risk of bleeding and infection also.. there is also a small risk that they can hurt the baby, if not guided carefully by ultrasound (in most high risk clinics they have eliminated this risk, but if the baby jerks suddenly the movement could still cause a mishap). Now, all that said... I was told with my 3rd child that I had a risk of a DS child.. in fact, they were pretty sure she was DS... but they did an ultrasound and couldn't find anything abnormal... and I refused the risks of  amnio and other invasive testing, knowing the screenings are not perfect... and just trusted and prayed.  She was perfectly healthy and is now my straight-A student  :-)  So... please don't let these tests take on too much weight and ruin the joy of your pregnancy. Even in the unlikely even that you have a child with DS... most cases are mild to moderate and because medical science understands a lot more than they did many years ago... average life expectancy is now about 70... and most have very happy, functional lives... Trust that if God blessed you at this point in your  life with a new special little one that He isn't going to put more on you or your family than you can handle... and has picked you as the perfect family for the little person chosen for you... there is a purpose for everything. Good luck, and God bless... whatever you decide... I wish you peace. W  Waitingforskim @shereem  Just curious, did you go ahead with the amnio? I'm in the same boat right now. 1:43. S  Swanmom8 I also have a child with DS and I thank god that I passed all the screening tests and did not find out until birth. I would have worried so much and it would have ruined my pregnancy. She is almost 6 years old and attends the same school as her siblings. I couldn't imagine life without her!This pregnancy, I did the nt scan and ultrasounds and everything looks great so I am going to assume everything is fine and enjoy my pregnancy. I personally handle things better if I don't have any knowledge of something bad ahead of time. Otherwise, I would worry too much!!!It is a decision that you have to make about whether you want to relax and accept your baby as is or do you need to know ahead of time if something is wrong so as to prepare mentally. Good luck with your decision!!!Julie L  LanhamBaby1 @shereem  This is probably one of the best mssgs i have read since i joined. In fact, it almost made me cry. I have just turned 39 and my husband is 45..and we have feared the same. But after reading all the mssgs we've decided not to do any of the tests, except for the amnio. After reading your mssg, i'm not sure if i wanna do that either. But we are one of the cpls that decided if something was wrong, we wld abort. We just feel life is too hard for those of us who are healthy, or close to it..and it wld be so much harder on a child w/issues. I believe in God very much and i pray every day. I will pray that God helps us make the right decision and watches over our unborn child, as it grows. We are 9wks today, 1st sono on Mon. I can't wait, this is his first and i'm anxious to watch him experience it all. Thank you so much for everything you said. :) S  Swanmom8 I just want to add that I have never had a day that I regret that I had my dd with DS. But I would have 100% had regret if I had terminated a baby. We spent the day at a park with a lake today. My dd with DS always makes lots of friends and we had a young couple come up to us and hang out with us just to be with Emma. The young man's (23) brother has DS (24) and kept telling us how smart his brother was and you could tell he adored him. His girlfriend was telling us she is going to school to work with special education students. My dd with DS does what all other kids do at the beach...swim, make sandcastles, play with kids. We don't have to make any special accommodations for her as she is very independent and just like any of our other 7 kids. I think that we all remember the kids with DS from our childhood who weren't treated as equals or educated with typical kids. It makes a big difference!Just wanted to share a little more about a child with DS!!! Julie K  KristaRee @shereem  I was in your place last fall. We decided that it did not matter if he had DS or not, it was not going to change anything for us so we did not do the amnio. He turned out fine and healthy. So you have to decide if it is worth worrying over. We deicded the stress of it was not worth it for us and those tests are not always accurate. Good luck to you s  shereem @Waitingforskim  Hi! Yes.. I went ahead with the amnio. We decided that we wanted to know just to be prepared. And I am glad we did. I am happy and grateful to say that we have a perfectly healthy 15 month old baby boy. But getting the amnio was a hard decision to make.. but I am glad that I was able to enjoy the rest of my pregnancy worry free. Good luck to you. I am sure you will make the right decision for you and your family. <3 s  shereem @LanhamBaby1  First of all... Congrats on your pregnancy! I decided to go ahead with the amnio and the results all came back fine. We now have a beautiful 15 month old baby boy. Its a hard decision to make, I know. Â But afterwards I was able to enjoy the rest of my pregnancy. Have you had any tests yet? Good luck with your pregnancy and I am sure you will make the decision that is right for you and your family. :) W  Waitingforskim @shereem  Thanks so much for your reply and Congrats on your happy healthy baby boy!!!! We've decided to schedule the amnio. I think in the long run it's just the best choice for us as I'd be so worried and stressed out for the remainder of the pregnancy if I didn't get an answer. Either way it will help me relax/prepare before the baby comes. l  lavenderrose @BackforMore  your reply was helpful. thanks for sharing. l  lavenderrose @BackforMore  your reply was helpful. thanks for sharing. l  lavenderrose @Swanmom8  your reply was helpful. thanks for sharing.

Half the chromosomes come from the egg (the mother) and half come from the sperm (the father). This XY chromosome pair includes the X chromosome from the egg and the Y chromosome from the sperm. In Down syndrome, there is an additional copy of chromosome 21, resulting in three copies instead of the normal two copies.     Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome.  Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals, causing lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays. It's the most common genetic chromosomal disorder and cause of learning disabilities in children. It also commonly causes other medical abnormalities, including heart and gastrointestinal disorders.  Better understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly increase the quality of life for children and adults with this disorder and help them live fulfilling lives.      Symptoms Each person with Down syndrome is an individual — intellectual and developmental problems may be mild, moderate or severe. Some people are healthy while others have significant health problems such as serious heart defects.  Children and adults with Down syndrome have distinct facial features. Though not all people with Down syndrome have the same features, some of the more common features include:   Flattened face  Small head  Short neck  Protruding tongue  Upward slanting eye lids (palpebral fissures)  Unusually shaped or small ears  Poor muscle tone  Broad, short hands with a single crease in the palm  Relatively short fingers and small hands and feet  Excessive flexibility  Tiny white spots on the colored part (iris) of the eye called Brushfield's spots  Short height   Infants with Down syndrome may be average size, but typically they grow slowly and remain shorter than other children the same age.  Intellectual disabilities Most children with Down syndrome have mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Language is delayed, and both short and long-term memory is affected.  When to see a doctor Children with Down syndrome usually are diagnosed before or at birth. However, if you have any questions regarding your pregnancy or your child's growth and development, talk with your doctor.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from your father, the other from your mother.  Down syndrome results when abnormal cell division involving chromosome 21 occurs. These cell division abnormalities result in an extra partial or full chromosome 21. This extra genetic material is responsible for the characteristic features and developmental problems of Down syndrome. Any one of three genetic variations can cause Down syndrome:   Trisomy 21. About 95 percent of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 — the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies, in all cells. This is caused by abnormal cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell.  Mosaic Down syndrome. In this rare form of Down syndrome, a person has only some cells with an extra copy of chromosome 21. This mosaic of normal and abnormal cells is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization.  Translocation Down syndrome. Down syndrome can also occur when a portion of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) onto another chromosome, before or at conception. These children have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, but they also have additional genetic material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome.   There are no known behavioral or environmental factors that cause Down syndrome.  Is it inherited? Most of the time, Down syndrome isn't inherited. It's caused by a mistake in cell division during early development of the fetus.  Translocation Down syndrome can be passed from parent to child. However, only about 3 to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome have translocation and only some of them inherited it from one of their parents.  When balanced translocations are inherited, the mother or father has some rearranged genetic material from chromosome 21 on another chromosome, but no extra genetic material. This means he or she has no signs or symptoms of Down syndrome, but can pass an unbalanced translocation on to children, causing Down syndrome in the children.  Risk factors Some parents have a greater risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. Risk factors include:   Advancing maternal age. A woman's chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome increase with age because older eggs have a greater risk of improper chromosome division. A woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down syndrome increases after 35 years of age. However, most children with Down syndrome are born to women under age 35 because younger women have far more babies.  Being carriers of the genetic translocation for Down syndrome. Both men and women can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children.  Having had one child with Down syndrome. Parents who have one child with Down syndrome and parents who have a translocation themselves are at an increased risk of having another child with Down syndrome. A genetic counselor can help parents assess the risk of having a second child with Down syndrome.   Complications People with Down syndrome can have a variety of complications, some of which become more prominent as they get older. These complications can include:   Heart defects. About half the children with Down syndrome are born with some type of congenital heart defect. These heart problems can be life-threatening and may require surgery in early infancy.  Gastrointestinal (GI) defects. GI abnormalities occur in some children with Down syndrome and may include abnormalities of the intestines, esophagus, trachea and anus. The risk of developing digestive problems, such as GI blockage, heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux) or celiac disease, may be increased.  Immune disorders. Because of abnormalities in their immune systems, people with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, some forms of cancer, and infectious diseases, such as pneumonia.  Sleep apnea. Because of soft tissue and skeletal changes that lead to the obstruction of their airways, children and adults with Down syndrome are at greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea.  Obesity. People with Down syndrome have a greater tendency to be obese compared with the general population.  Spinal problems. Some people with Down syndrome may have a misalignment of the top two vertebrae in the neck (atlantoaxial instability). This condition puts them at risk of serious injury to the spinal cord from overextension of the neck.  Leukemia. Young children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of leukemia.  Dementia. People with Down syndrome have a greatly increased risk of dementia — signs and symptoms may begin around age 50. Having Down syndrome also increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.  Other problems. Down syndrome may also be associated with other health conditions, including endocrine problems, dental problems, seizures, ear infections, and hearing and vision problems.   For people with Down syndrome, getting routine medical care and treating issues when needed can help with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  Life expectancy Life spans have increased dramatically for people with Down syndrome. Today, someone with Down syndrome can expect to live more than 60 years, depending on the severity of health problems.  Prevention There's no way to prevent Down syndrome. If you're at high risk of having a child with Down syndrome or you already have one child with Down syndrome, you may want to consult a genetic counselor before becoming pregnant.  A genetic counselor can help you understand your chances of having a child with Down syndrome. He or she can also explain the prenatal tests that are available and help explain the pros and cons of testing.

Extra or Missing Chromosomes          Back to Extra or Missing Chromosomes           English   Español       How do you calculate the risks of having a child with Trisomy 21 if the mother is 44 years old, the father is 46 years old and there has already been one miscarriage due to Trisomy 21?        -A curious adult from the U.S.   June 4, 2014  Two of the three factors you’ve mentioned are important for figuring out the risk for having a child with Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome.  The one that doesn’t play a big role is the age of the dad.  Of the other two, the one that usually matters most is mom’s age.  As you can see in the chart below, a mom’s chance of having a child with Down syndrome gets higher as she gets older.    So, in most cases, a 44-year-old woman would have around a 3% chance of having a child with Down syndrome.  The flip side of that means she has a 97% chance of not having a child with Down syndrome.  The final risk factor is one that depends on why a couple had a child with Down syndrome in the first place.  Most cases of Down syndrome are the result of a mistake that happens when an egg or sperm gets made.  This just happens by random chance, so having one child with Down syndrome for this reason usually doesn’t really increase your chance for having a second.  There are a few cases though where Down syndrome is more common in a family for genetic reasons.  One of these is something called a translocation.  If mom has a translocation, then the chance to have a child with Down syndrome can go up to around 10-12%. If dad has the balanced translocation, then the chance is about 3%. A family can tell if this is the issue with a blood test on mom and dad that looks at their chromosomes.  So that is how to calculate the risks in this case.  Assuming there isn’t a balanced translocation, then the only big factor is mom’s age.  At 44, there is about a 3% chance for her child to have Down syndrome.  Now I want to talk a little bit about why as a woman gets older her chances for a child with Down syndrome increase. Then we will talk about the type of Down syndrome that can “run in a family.”   The Problem with Older Eggs  We can’t talk about Down syndrome without talking about chromosomes. You might remember that chromosomes are the packages of instructions that are in every cell of our body.  They tell our bodies what to look like, how tall to grow, and how to function.  Humans usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes.  We get one of each pair passed down from mom and one of each pair from dad.  Sometimes, there is a random mistake when the sperm or egg is being made. This causes there to be extra or missing chromosomes passed down from that parent. If this happens with an extra copy of chromosome 21, it causes Down syndrome.  This happens by random chance, but this chance goes up as a woman gets older. This is because women are born with all of the eggs they are ever going to have and as a woman gets older, her eggs get older too.  So the older the egg is when it is getting ready to package only half of the chromosomes to pass down (one of each pair), the higher chance that a chromosome pair will get stuck together. This is what happens with Down syndrome, the chromosome 21 pair gets stuck together.  There is also a higher chance as women get older of the other chromosome pairs getting stuck together when they are getting packaged into an egg, but Down syndrome we see in pregnancies and babies that are born.  A mistake in packaging of chromosomes can happen with dad too, but the chances really don’t get higher as dad gets older. That is because men are constantly producing new sperm every couple of weeks, so there isn’t a higher chance that the chromosomes will get stuck together. But as you can see here , children of older dads are at a higher risk for a different set of conditions.  So if a couple has had a previous pregnancy with Down syndrome for this reason, then the chance of having a child with Down syndrome is usually low, about 1 in 100 or if she is 40 or above, whatever her chance is due to her age.   Balanced Translocations  Now that we talked about Down syndrome that just happens by random chance, let’s talk about Down syndrome that can “run in families.” This happens if Down syndrome is caused by a translocation. What that means is that one chromosome gets stuck to another chromosome.  About 4% of cases of Down syndrome are caused by something called a Robertsonian translocation, also known as Translocation Down syndrome. This can be random or inherited from a parent. This happens when the extra copy of chromosome 21 becomes attached to another chromosome. To learn more about how this happens, click here .  You can see an example where the extra copy of chromosome 21 is attached to the top of chromosome 14 in the image below:    Even though it is arranged differently, there are still three copies of chromosome 21 and this still causes Down syndrome.  To see if it was inherited, you have to see if one of the parents has a translocation as well. This can be done by a blood test on each parent.  If Down syndrome was inherited, one parent would have chromosomes that looked something like the picture below:    Here one copy of chromosome 21 is attached to chromosome 14, but there is only one other copy of chromosome 21. This is called a balanced translocation. The parent has the typical number of chromosomes just arranged in a different way so the translocation usually does not cause any health problems for the person.  The reason it can be helpful to know if Down syndrome was caused by a translocation is because it will change your risk. If a parent has a balanced translocation, the chance of passing down an extra chromosome to a child depends of which parent has the translocation. There is about a 3% chance for Down syndrome to happen again if dad has the translocation and about a 10-12% chance if mom has the translocation. To find out more about these numbers, click here .  So the most likely scenario is that Down syndrome in your previous pregnancy was random and not the type that is inherited. If this is true, the chance of having a child with Down syndrome would be around 3%, and a 97% chance of not having a child with Down syndrome.

The chromosomes are arranged in pairs and this is what they look like under a microscope. A has the usual 46 chromosomes while B has an extra chromosome 21 as indicated by the red circle.  The most common way for someone to end up with Down syndrome is if mom's egg has an etra chromosome 21.
