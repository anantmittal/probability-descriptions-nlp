You may not be able to land a job even after weeks or months of job search. This is because most of the jobseekers are using specific strategies to stay ahead in the competition. If you don’t want to be left behind in the race, you too need to have an action-plan ready with you. The more time it takes to look for a job, the more frustrated you can become. So, you need to act now!  Given below are seven key tips that you can use to boost your job search and land a job before it’s really too late.    #1. Don’t Look for a Perfect Job  If you ask career experts, they’ll tell you that there’s nothing like a perfect job. You may not always be able to get all you want from a job in a single package, particularly when the going is really tough. Therefore, the first thing that you need to keep in mind while trying to get a new job is ‘let go of perfectionism’. You’ll always have time to find better opportunities when you’ve got a job already.  #2. Gear Up Really Well  Preparation is always the key, whether it’s submitting a resume, applying for a job, attending an interview or meeting with the employer. Make sure all your gears are in good order. Spend adequate time to create an impressive resume. Do remember to tailor your cover letter to the specific requirements of the employer you want to work with.  Take a look at How To Write a Resume – Feel the Employer Pain .  #3. Network Extensively (But not Blindly)  Social or professional networking can bring you amazing results. If you want to boost your chances of landing a job really quickly, you should try to connect with more and more influential people, both offline and online. Attend social and community events where you can get to know new people. Be active on popular social networking websites like Faceboo, Twitter and LinkedIn. In any case, don’t waste your time networking blinding. Always connect with those people who you think can bring you career benefits in some way or the other.

And it’s so easy to get frustrated when you see no results from your job search. Not every employer will want to hire you. Hiring managers will offer you a job only when they are fully convinced of your potential and how you can help their company with your skills. Even if you are rejected in your first few attempts, you need to continue with your job search. If it’s really taking longer than what you expected, you need to review your strategy and modify the action plan.  #5. Focus on Getting Your Foot in the Door First  If you really want to boost your chances of getting a job, you should first try to get your foot in the door. The first break is important. Unless you get your first break in the industry, you can’t build the work experience that you’ll need to negotiate better job or career opportunities.  #6. Also Target Regional Job Websites  Don’t make potential job search mistakes like many others do. While it’s always advisable to submit your resume to the major job boards, it’s also a useful recommendation not to ignore regional job sites. Try to find jobs in your own location by visiting job sites that focus on a specific region.  Have a look at the Riley Guide or Job-Hunt.org for job board directories.  #7. Don’t Ignore Temporary Jobs  Getting a temporary job is always better than sitting unemployed. Since these are really lean times, you shouldn’t completely ignore temporary jobs. Many companies hire candidates for temporarily. If it’s one with a potential employer, you should grab it quickly. Who knows when this temporary job can turn into a full-time job position. Just give your 100 percent to whatever job you take up and try to showcase your most essential and unique skills.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.             By Jane Bianchi  This post originally appeared on LearnVest .  Why is it that some people just seem to effortlessly climb the career ladder? You know these folks we speak of: They always know how to dazzle during an interview, and they have a knack for nabbing that prime position before it’s even posted.  What’s their secret?  According to the authors of "Fearless Job Hunting: Powerful Psychological Strategies for Getting the Job You Want,” these are people who have mastered the job hunt by not only honing their skills but also building up the psychological know-how to get through a sometimes soul-crushing process.  We tapped two of the book's coauthors—Bill Knaus, a psychologist who specializes in personnel selection, and Russell Grieger, a psychologist and organizational consultant—to find out what makes such so-called fearless job hunters tick.    Based on their research, Knaus and Grieger have pinpointed eight key traits that they say make these job-seekers so resilient—and a hiring manager’s dream.  Fearless Trait #1: They Accentuate the Positives  It's easy to feel down on yourself after getting rejected for a dream job, either telling yourself that you're a failure or that you don’t have what it takes to succeed. According to Grieger, that’s because "so many people wrap their self-worth around their careers." There are, however, ways to dig yourself out of that hole of negativity, and approach the process in a more fearless fashion.   First, ask yourself whether what you're thinking is logical—and whether it gets you anywhere. Here’s a hint: The answer to both should be no!  Then flip the script, and tell yourself, "This will be hard, but I can do it," or "I've accomplished a lot in my life, and I'm fully capable of accomplishing this." Even if your career prospects don’t pan out, don’t accept that as the be-all, end-all. Instead, say to yourself, "If I fail at this, it doesn't mean that my whole life is a failure," or "I have a lot to offer—if this interviewer doesn't appreciate it, someone else will."  Finally, give yourself a pep talk by writing down a list of your best qualities as a person, as well as an employee, and then read them aloud. This will help to build up your confidence—and further motivate you during the job hunt.  Fearless Trait #2: They Identify Their Hang-Ups  Does job hunting stress you out so much that you keep putting it off? Once you can confront your specific issues head on, you'll put less stress on yourself—fearless job hunter-style.  Start by pinpointing what could be the underlying cause (or causes) of your particular hang-up, and then “strip away whatever loadstone you have on your back," says Knaus. For instance, if you're nervous that your résumé isn't up to par, ask a mentor to critique it. Or if you're unsure of what to say in an interview, practice with a friend and videotape the session, so you can review it and improve upon your delivery.

You Have a 1.2% Chance of Getting a Job Through an Online Application – How to Increase Your Odds Published on September 25, 2014 Charlotte Weeks Follow Following Unfollow Charlotte Weeks Sign in to follow this author Executive Resume Writer ♦ Executive Career Coach ♦ Outplacement Consultant ♦ Corporate Bio & LinkedIn Profile Writer I recently attended The National Resume Writers’ Association’s annual conference, where I learned of this startling statistic. While I always knew that having an internal company contact was MUCH more effective than applying to open jobs, even I was surprised by this low number. This information was first shared at the Career Thought Leaders conference, where it was provided by Gerry Crispin of Career Xroads (an author of the annual Source of Hire report).  So, does this mean job seekers shouldn’t use job boards anymore? Not in my opinion. They exist for a reason, and I have had many clients get positions this way. However, many, many more have found their roles through a contact, so it makes sense to spend more time and energy on networking than applying online.  Still, if you find a position online that you’d like to apply for (and you don’t have a company contact), you can increase your chances of getting an interview. This can be done by:  1) Making sure you have at least 75% of the qualifications: By taking a less-is-more approach, and only applying to those positions for which you are truly a fit, you’ll save time and be more likely to receive an interview.  2) Optimizing your resume for keywords: Online resumes are often first screened using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Typically, an HR employee will put in hard skills and industry-specific terms that apply to the job. While only the company knows what those keywords will be, the job ad can provide clues. Review each description to make sure that all relevant qualifications you possess are included in your resume.  3) Sending a copy by snail mail: You’ll still need to apply online, but get an extra edge by sending a hard copy. This is rarely done anymore, which is why those that use this method are almost guaranteed to get their resumes read.  4) Following up: If it’s a confidential ad (no company listed) or it says “no calls,” this strategy doesn’t apply. However, those that follow up get their name heard one more time than the hundreds who have applied online – even if you only end up leaving a voicemail. More often than not, you can find someone in your target department through a Google search, reviewing the company’s About Us page, or even just calling the main number.  If you’re going to apply online, give these methods a shot – what do you have to lose?  Charlotte Weeks is the President of Weeks Career Services, Inc.

It’s understandable that not hearing back from employers is often frustrating.  The truth, however, is that there are real people on the other end. They are often sorting through numerous applications each day, hoping to narrow in on the candidates who best meet their needs. Once you’ve found jobs you want to apply for , one of your main goals as a job seeker is to make it crystal clear to those potential employers why you are a great fit for the position.  It’s hard to know exactly what will help you stand out. So, we took a close look at how the most successful job seekers are using Indeed. From this study, we learned that there are several things people do while applying to jobs that, in some cases, dramatically increase their chances of getting a positive response from employers.  These are three habits of highly effective job seekers:  1. Be selective about the jobs you apply for  By far the most important thing you can do in your job search is to carefully evaluate each job you’re applying for. When you find a posting you like, ask yourself if it’s a job you’re qualified for and actually want to do. (Also, review our guidelines for a safe job search and always report suspicious listings.)  When you’re in the middle of a job search, it may feel like you’re increasing your chances of getting a job if you apply for as many jobs as possible. But our analysis of the data shows that may not always be the case. When we look at a month’s worth of applications on Indeed, we find that the group of people submitting the highest number of applications are far less likely to receive a positive response from employers — 39% less likely, in fact.  Here’s the takeaway: The right number of jobs to apply for is going to be different for each person. Instead of focusing on the quantity of applications you submit, put your energy into screening each job carefully so you can craft high quality applications. These are some actions you may want to consider before you apply:   Read the job description from start to finish  Identify what makes this job posting attractive to you  Decide whether you could reasonably do this job by reviewing examples from your background that demonstrate the required skills and qualifications  Take note of any instructions on how to apply  Once you’ve started the application, carefully read and answer any questions  Double check your responses before you submit   While this approach may increase the amount of time you spend upfront, it has the potential to shorten your job search overall because you’re submitting great applications that employers are more likely to respond to.  2. Keep your job search organized  The most successful job seekers approach their search for a new opportunity with discipline. This approach is similar to how you might prepare for an exam or tackle a tough work assignment — you’ll need to set aside enough time and take it on step by step.  One of the easiest ways to stay organized and on task is to use your Indeed account as a hub for all your job searching. In fact, people with an Indeed account are 22% more likely to get a positive response from employers when they apply.  If you’re signed in, you can quickly save jobs as you’re searching and return later to thoroughly evaluate them. You’ll be able to easily see and update the status of each job: saved, applied, interviewing, offered and hired. You can see this information on the My Jobs page of your account.  From your account inbox, you can review any messages you get from employers. You can also more seamlessly manage your email subscriptions : deleting job alerts that may no longer be relevant, pausing alerts you may want later, or adding new ones.  3. Gain back time when you’re filling in applications  Because you’re spending time upfront carefully evaluating each job posting, it’s nice to gain that time back when you’re applying. With an Indeed Resume , applying is fast and you can easily apply on mobile. If you are signed in , applying with your Indeed Resume will be the default option for completing an application when you select “Easily apply.”  Indeed Resume is a clean resume template that lets you fill in your skills and past experience — the more relevant details you add, the more likely you are to get a response from employers. Your resume will be clear and formatted in a way that’s easy to read. If you encounter longer applications, some of the questions can be pre-filled with information from your Indeed Resume.  We see people benefitting immensely from this approach — job seekers who apply using an Indeed Resume are 27% more likely to get a positive response from employers than those who upload a resume file.    Create an Indeed Resume    Remember: your goal is to make it easy for prospective employers to say “yes” to your job application. By putting these habits into practice, you can increase your chances of moving on to the next steps.

Methodology  The findings presented here come from several proprietary Indeed data sources. We examined a sample month of aggregated, anonymous data from job applications submitted in the US via Indeed Apply, a service used by thousands of employers to easily accept applications from any device.  A positive response is a response from an employer provided to Indeed that indicates interest in the candidate. To understand which user behaviors were correlated with receiving a positive response from employers, we split the user data into two groups for each variable: whether they were logged into an Indeed account or not when they applied, whether they created and deleted job alerts or not, whether they were among the users submitting the most applications or not, and whether they used an Indeed Resume while applying or not. We then compared the positive response rate among the two groups and calculated the percent difference.

Thanks to Jobvite’s recent report: “ New Year, New Job: What Job Seekers Need to Know in 2017 ,” you now have valuable insight into the process of job search and better sense of what your chances are for getting a new job in 2017.  Too often, job seekers make assumptions about job search that are not based on facts or realities.  You will learn that:   You’ll be interviewing a lot for your next job.  You’re up against some competition.  You won’t land every job you interview for.   Understand and apply this information so you have a realistic perspective on your job hunt- AND know what you’ll need to do to stand out.  The Interview Process Takes Longer Than You Expect or Want  I’ve always said this. And data proves it. Employers are putting you through more interviews and that takes time.  From the time you apply to the time you are hired takes an average of 28 days according to Jobvite.  Image via Jobvite  What can you do about this? Nothing. Except you can WOW the interviewer by doing these things.  4 Ways To Win Extra Points During Your Next Interview .  How Many Applicants Are Competing  You can expect more competition, but exactly how much more?  Some industries have more competition than others.  As you can see, consumer internet is the most competitive, with over 66 applicants per hire. In case you were wondering, consumer internet companies include gaming, apps, e-commerce, search, social media as well as others. You know the big names in these areas (Google, Zappos, Amazon, etc.). The less-sexy insurance industry jobs don’t see the same level of interest with only 14 applicants per hire.  Based on Jobvite’s data, you can expect the competition to look like this:  Image via Jobvite  You have some choices here- prepare to compete or target industries with less competition (when possible).  5 Tips To Stand Out In Job Search and see how this woman landed her dream job at LinkedIn .

Companies in the media industry only invite 7% of applicants, while educational institutions invite 19%.

Have you ever wondered how certain people seem to have job or internship interviews lined up all of the time? Or why someone you know, who on paper isn’t that much different from you, seemingly has dozens of offers to choose from? While their resume might be similar to yours it's usually their approach to the job search that really ( and literally ) separates them from all of the other people applying.  Understand Your Odds Of Getting An Interview  There are multiple reports on what the average number of applicants per job is and they vary from source to source. Some say 118 applicants per job opening and others say up to 250. Your mileage may vary according to which organization and which industry you’re interested in. The main point is that if you’re only applying to jobs by submitting your application then your resume and application materials are going to be facing a lot of competition.  Know What An Applicant Tracking System Does  Did you know that most organizations now use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). ATS are designed to quickly push out non-qualified applicants by using a set of questions that immediately disqualify people if answered incorrectly. ATS also use keyword filters that grade by the context in which keywords are used, the number of times that they are used as well as where they appear in the resume and application materials. If a person’s keyword score doesn’t past the minimum cut-off score then they’re automatically disqualified as well.  It’s estimated that as much as 50% of applicants are disqualified before their resume even reaches an actual person. Immediately, we see why getting an interview by simply submitting an application is such a rarity.  Take Advantage Of The Employee Referral Option  There are 2 key reasons why it’s better to go through the employee referral route:  1. Most Employee Referrals Get Fast Tracked  2. It’s Usually In The Recruiter’s Best Interest To Hire A Referred Person  Most Employee Referrals Get Fast Tracked  Nelson Schwartz, from the New York Times, recently wrote an article that included great examples highlighting the benefits of being referred by an employee:  “Riju Parakh wasn’t even looking for a new job. But when a friend at Ernst & Young recommended her, Ms. Parakh’s résumé was quickly separated from the thousands the firm receives every week because she was referred by a current employee, and within three weeks she was hired. ‘You know how long this usually takes,’ she said. ‘It was miraculous.’”  “Although Ernst & Young looks at every résumé submitted, ‘a referral puts them in the express lane’ said Larry Nash, director of experienced and executive recruiting there.”  It’s Usually In The Recruiter’s Best Interest To Hire A Referred Person  Put yourself in the hiring manager’s position. Your job is to fill the position with the candidate that you think will be able to add value to your organization. You need to do this while minimizing costs both in the short term (e.g., costs associated with the hire) and in the long run (e.g., costs associated with having to hire someone else at a later point).  If your data shows that applicants hired from a referral have greater job satisfaction and stay longer, and that the recruiting process was shorter and less expensive, then isn’t it in your best interest to hire someone who was referred by someone already working there and who understands the demands and expectations of the job?  Be Strategic And Take The Road Less Traveled  Reports have shown that employee referrals only make up 7% of applicants but that they account for 40% of all hires. Be strategic and understand how going through an employee referral puts you in position to give yourself much better odds.  Not every organization employs an Employee Referral Program (ERP) so it’s important to do your research on organizations you’re interested in to see if they have one in place.  If they do, great. Go to LinkedIn and search for the organization you’re interested in — a list of people of who work there, along with how you’re connected to them, should appear. See who you know there, or who you could get to know, who could refer you. 1st and 2nd level connections are ideal. If you’re thinking about reaching out to a 2nd level connection be sure to reach out to them through one of your 1st level connections first.  If you don’t know anyone there that could potentially refer you then don’t fret. Do like Ryan Holmes, CEO of HootSuite, advises and “use social networks to boost your networking power… start following people in [your] industry on Twitter and connect with them on LinkedIn. Through these networks, research employers and reach out to them through trusted friends and colleagues who might be able to make introductions.”  Ryan also has great advice on expectations when reaching out on social media, saying that “It’s helpful not to expect a set outcome from these encounters, rather to be open-minded. Learn things; get to know people. The best part is that communication doesn’t have to be all that formal. Even just talking about common interests or sharing an interesting article can build trust and open doors.” In addition to social media, his advice on expectations works well for employee referrals too.  And finally if the organization you’re interested in doesn’t have an ERP in place don’t overlook the importance of referrals. Even for the organizations that don’t employ an ERP a referral is still a good way to help set yourself a part from your competition.

If you’re looking for a job in catering, you’ve probably gathered by now that you’re not alone. But with competition for every role, no matter what the level, how do you stand out?    We’ve got 5 easy ways to boost your chances of landing that job.                           1. Sort out your CV (and upload it to our database)  Your CV is the first step in getting noticed by an employer, so it’s not something you can rush in a bid to apply first. Get it wrong and within a few sentences your carefully crafted application is in the bin, but if it’s written well and nicely formatted you’re more likely to catch an employee’s eye for all the right reasons.  But don’t stop at emailing out your application to individual employers, make them come to you as well. By uploading your CV to the Caterer database employers can find you before you’ve even seen their job ad. Who says you have to do all the hard work?  Think your CV could be better? We’ve got some handy hints and simple tips to transform your job application .    2. Prepare thoroughly for interviews  Practice makes perfect, and interviews are no exception. Although you can’t be prepared for everything on the big day, there are some common questions interviewers always tend to ask, no matter what the role is. Remember, employers don’t want you to have a bad interview experience, so try to relax, they’re on your side. Questions you can prepare for include:   1 – So…tell me about yourself  This is normally asked within minutes of every interview, and with a little preparation you won’t be one of the many candidates who come unstuck on it.  The best tip we can give you is to keep your answer short and simple. Tell them about your background, your accomplishments, why you want to work for their company and what your future goals are. If you think you might struggle on this one, look at your CV before you go in to refresh your memory.   2 – Behavioural based questions  Just think of these as an extension of the “tell us about you” questions, as your answers will normally end up referring to your previous roles and experiences. Expect questions like...   Tell me about a time you’ve had to juggle lots of tasks at once  How do you deal with complaining customers?  Describe a time when you have had to get the most out of someone who was under-performing   You get the idea. These questions are easy to plan for, so don’t panic, prepare instead .    3 - Think about your skills  Every job in the hospitality industry requires skill; communication skills and understanding of the check-in process for concierge staff, artistic and culinary skills for chefs or time management and organisation skills for managers .  But whether you’re a newbie to the hospitality industry or have worked in senior management for years, you’re bound to have transferable skills you can bring to any job you want to apply for.  Before you start picking out your interview outfit , try and work out what skills and strengths you have to show off in the interview.  But it’s not just your good features you need to focus on, it’s always good to be aware of your weaknesses too and find out if there are any skills that are lacking on your CV.  Don’t be scared to point out these weaknesses out to prospective employers. By admitting you’re looking to develop more skills and grow on the job, it shows employers you’re not only willing to learn, but that you’re also committed to the hospitality industry.  If you want to start learning new skills and developing existing ones immediately, you could always take up a course or qualifications in a way that suits your schedule and budget.      4 - Research the company BEFORE applying  You want the interviewer to have read your CV before you enter their office, and likewise it’s always good to research a company you want to work for.  Although it’s all well and good doing this a few days before the interview, this is often too late. Researching into a company should come before any sort of application is made, whether you’re apply for a receptionist job in a small restaurant or the area manager of a large hotel chain.  Tailoring your CV and covering letter to suit their company shows you have an interest in that specific role, and haven’t just forwarded the same email to hundreds of other employers. The better impression your initial application makes, the more likely they are to be positive about any interview you get, and so, the more likely you are to get the job.    5 – Submit your application  We know it can be scary applying for a new job, but don’t be afraid to get proactive in your job search. There’s no point doing all this hard work and preparation and then not applying. If you’ve followed this advice then you’re well on your way to a fantastic application and really boosting your chances of being successful.

But most people don't realize how important it is to put your best foot forward as you take that next step, the job interview—otherwise you'll blow your chances and walk away empty-handed. The Problem: You've got the education, experience, and references, all presented on a well-put together resume that gets you job interviews. But you never get a job offer. The harsh truth: Most recruiters and potential employers know within the first five minutes of an interview whether you're right for the job. Even before you have spoken one single word, you are judged by what you look like. The mind and “gut feel” works so fast that within a few minutes a decision has already been made. The Solution: First impressions can get you in the door, but you also want to stay. You'll have an advantage by knowing what recruiters and potential employers are looking for and how they think. The Job Interview Secrets No One Tells You  As the founder of a successful global headhunting firm serving Fortune 500 companies for over twelve years, and author of the books: A Second Life, God is giving you a second chance, and Secrets of the Executive Search Experts, well as self help books on “how to get the job,” I have coached thousands of people who have gotten the jobs they wanted. Some of the secrets I shared with them: How to walk, talk, dress, and look for a job interview  Recruiters and potential employers very often like to recruit people like themselves and, of course, they want employees who will be good representatives for their company. When going for a job interview, you'd better dress the part, so wearing inappropriate clothing won't be a reason for them to reject you. In my younger days even I messed this up by either saying the wrong things or dressing in such a bad way that I am now surprised that I did such a thing. When I was twenty-one, I went to the office of a leading U.S. consulting firm to apply for a part-time job wearing an off-white linen suit and a pink shirt. This was in the late eighties and the outfit was a great going-out-socially outfit at the time, but it was a disaster for the corporate world. I lost the job before I even got to say a word. - How do you know what to wear? There are some universal rules that apply no matter what environment you want to work in. First, a lways dress as though you are worth how much they are going to pay you . When I meet a candidate who dresses like a slacker, my first impression is that he/she isn't worth the money they would be paid. And if someone doesn't have enough respect for himself/herself to dress appropriately, he/she would not be an asset in any job. Look at the environment where you are applying for a job and dress accordingly. If you have to, do reconnaissance. Park or stand near the building where the company is located and see what types of outfits the employees entering or leaving the building are wearing. Or call the company's main number and ask the person who answers the phone what the dress code or preferred attire is for those working there. Always over dress rather than under dress, but don't go so far that you're a total mismatch. Use common sense. When applying for a corporate job, don't come in jeans. When applying for a job in a grocery store, don't wear a dark blue suit with a tie. Always dress your part. And no matter what, you need to look sharp—neat and clean. Remember, for your first interview—and all other interviews that follow—always go in looking like you're ready to do the job you're applying for and will fit right in at the company. That way you'll never be judged or disqualified for the way you dress. - Preview your outfit at home. After studying your potential new work environment and deciding what you're going to wear, put on your outfit and look at yourself in a full-length mirror. Start with your shoes. Do they look worn out and soiled? For men: Do your socks match the shoes and the pants? Are the pants clean, pressed and in good condition? How about your belt, shirt, suit jacket and tie, if they are appropriate? For women: Do your shoes, dress or suit look like a coordinated outfit? Are your clothes clean, pressed and in good condition? For both men and women: Are you well put together? Does what you are wearing represent you? Bottom line, your outfit should all match and be of the best quality possible. I do realize when times are tough or money is tight that you may feel overwhelmed when looking in your closet, thinking you have nothing good enough, new enough or of the appropriate style or quality for the job you want to get. If possible, invest in yourself: Go out and buy an “interview outfit.” When that's not possible, borrow an outfit from a friend. The point is, this may be your opportunity to change your economic circumstances, as well as create a better job/career future, so give it your all. It's also very important to always be well groomed. Trends come and go, such as sideburns, a goat beard or long hair on men, but one thing that never fades or changes in the professional world is looking clean cut, well groomed and professional. In the very competitive job market don't give potential employers any reason to kill your opportunity of getting a job just because you can't bear to part with your ponytail or goat beard (if you're a guy), claiming it's a statement about your authenticity. When you are a player in the job market you have to follow the rules in order to win. - Handshake and eye contact. A limp handshake shows no backbone. If a job candidate grasps too hard, it feels uncomfortable for the other person and it can appear that he/she is trying to prove something. Perfect a handshake that is warm and connecting; firm, but not too hard; and engaging, but not wishy-washy. When it comes to eye contact, look your interviewer straight in the eyes throughout your meeting—unless, of course, they are showing you something, such as a report or a spreadsheet, then give it your full attention. Don't scan the room or look toward the window or down the hallway. People with wandering eyes appear to be not all the way present, which translates to “not really interested or focused.” People who don't maintain eye contact also come across as being insecure, which is a liability in the work world, not an asset. - Always keep structure in a conversation. When communicating with a potential employer, in addition to being well prepared, always have a mental structure in your mind about how the meeting should and will go. In this way you can make sure everything that's important to you gets covered. Also, make sure to get to the point fast. If you have nothing to say, don't just talk. It's annoying. Plus, people who don't convey facts or answer questions directly come across as having something to hide. On several occasions I have presented very strongly qualified and experienced candidates to clients/companies, but for some reason they couldn't get to the point. After an entire hour of social talk, not many facts were conveyed and the clients didn't feel they learned anything about the person. In essence, the job candidates talked themselves out of great job opportunities. During a job interview conversation, always have a structure in mind and make sure that everything gets covered during the allotted time. Your chances of nailing the job will dramatically increase. - Be confident, but be humble. Few companies want to hire a person who comes across as insecure. But they also aren't interested in the other extreme, a person who is cocky. Nobody likes a person who is full of himself/herself. Arrogance doesn't come across as self-confidence, but rather, as insecurity demanding attention. No company wants or needs an employee with that kind of attitude. However, one quality every company looks for in someone to hire is a person who is balanced—confident and humble at the same time. - Humor is important. In every company environment that I have known, humor is key. People with a sense of self-irony are always likeable because they don't take themselves too seriously. A job environment without smiles and laughter is a horrible place to work. Little feels better than having a good laugh. Therefore, job candidates with a sense of humor are much more likeable than a dry person that has a hard time smiling. The stories from the work environment that people remember and tell others are often the funny things that took place. The same goes with when an interviewer meets a well-qualified candidate with self-irony and a sense of humor. Such a person is easy to remember. Being able to put a smile on the face of the person interviewing you is an ice breaker, which gives you an advantage. But don't push it too far by giving the impression you don't take yourself or your job seriously—again, it's all about the balance. Nobody wants to work with a disrespectful clown. And humor can never be at someone else's expense. Job candidates with a smile, who have the ability to connect with others, always have an advantage. And, of course, when everything else is in place they're way ahead of the game. - Physical posture in a meeting. When a job candidate enters the room for their interview with bad posture and looking uncomfortable, the impression they make is just as negative as being inappropriately dressed and unprepared. I have even seen high-profile candidates leaning back in their chairs as if they were at home in their living rooms. It's important when you are in a job interview to sit up straight and behave as professionally as you can. And it is always more engaging if you lean forward a little toward the interviewer as it shows more interest than almost falling off the chair backwards when being too relaxed. - How to follow-up after the interview. After someone takes time out of their busy schedule to meet with you regarding a potential job opportunity, it's customary and a courtesy to always send them a thank you letter or email. This letter or email is very important. It gives you an opportunity to do many things, especially when you are left with the impression that another interview or a job offer may be coming: politely thank them for their time and the opportunity to meet with them  once again state your strong interest in the job  express that you got a great impression of their company  tell them you look forward to the next step in the process  tell them that if they need any more information from you to please let you know  Even if it was clear at the end of your interview that you and the specific job you were interviewing for weren't a good match, a thank you letter is still needed to leave the best possible impression. Include in such a letter: Thank them for their time and tell them what a great impression you got of their company. Also say something like: “If there are any future opportunities that come up that may be a better match for my skills, please keep me in mind.” After all, there's always a chance that could happen. And even if it doesn't, you could directly or indirectly run into that person again in the future. Always leave a good impression. When a friend, acquaintance, someone in your network, or a recruiter has given you the job lead or set up the interview, it's important to thank them too. Thank them for the opportunity and tell them you are excited about it. If a job offer comes through, don't forget to let your contact know with another thank you. And if a recruiter arranged your contact with the company that resulted in a fantastic job, send a gift to the recruiter. Always remember: When someone refers you for a job or hires you, they put their own name and reputation on the line. This is something to be very grateful about. Follow-ups, both after an interview and when you are hired, are critical ways to show gratitude.

You may not be able to land a job even after weeks or months of job search. This is because most of the jobseekers are using specific strategies to stay ahead in the competition. If you don’t want to be left behind in the race, you too need to have an action-plan ready with you. The more time it takes to look for a job, the more frustrated you can become. So, you need to act now!  Given below are seven key tips that you can use to boost your job search and land a job before it’s really too late.    #1. Don’t Look for a Perfect Job  If you ask career experts, they’ll tell you that there’s nothing like a perfect job. You may not always be able to get all you want from a job in a single package, particularly when the going is really tough. Therefore, the first thing that you need to keep in mind while trying to get a new job is ‘let go of perfectionism’. You’ll always have time to find better opportunities when you’ve got a job already.  #2. Gear Up Really Well  Preparation is always the key, whether it’s submitting a resume, applying for a job, attending an interview or meeting with the employer. Make sure all your gears are in good order. Spend adequate time to create an impressive resume. Do remember to tailor your cover letter to the specific requirements of the employer you want to work with.  Take a look at How To Write a Resume – Feel the Employer Pain .  #3. Network Extensively (But not Blindly)  Social or professional networking can bring you amazing results. If you want to boost your chances of landing a job really quickly, you should try to connect with more and more influential people, both offline and online. Attend social and community events where you can get to know new people. Be active on popular social networking websites like Faceboo, Twitter and LinkedIn. In any case, don’t waste your time networking blinding. Always connect with those people who you think can bring you career benefits in some way or the other.

And it’s so easy to get frustrated when you see no results from your job search. Not every employer will want to hire you. Hiring managers will offer you a job only when they are fully convinced of your potential and how you can help their company with your skills. Even if you are rejected in your first few attempts, you need to continue with your job search. If it’s really taking longer than what you expected, you need to review your strategy and modify the action plan.  #5. Focus on Getting Your Foot in the Door First  If you really want to boost your chances of getting a job, you should first try to get your foot in the door. The first break is important. Unless you get your first break in the industry, you can’t build the work experience that you’ll need to negotiate better job or career opportunities.  #6. Also Target Regional Job Websites  Don’t make potential job search mistakes like many others do. While it’s always advisable to submit your resume to the major job boards, it’s also a useful recommendation not to ignore regional job sites. Try to find jobs in your own location by visiting job sites that focus on a specific region.  Have a look at the Riley Guide or Job-Hunt.org for job board directories.  #7. Don’t Ignore Temporary Jobs  Getting a temporary job is always better than sitting unemployed. Since these are really lean times, you shouldn’t completely ignore temporary jobs. Many companies hire candidates for temporarily. If it’s one with a potential employer, you should grab it quickly. Who knows when this temporary job can turn into a full-time job position. Just give your 100 percent to whatever job you take up and try to showcase your most essential and unique skills.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.             By Jane Bianchi  This post originally appeared on LearnVest .  Why is it that some people just seem to effortlessly climb the career ladder? You know these folks we speak of: They always know how to dazzle during an interview, and they have a knack for nabbing that prime position before it’s even posted.  What’s their secret?  According to the authors of "Fearless Job Hunting: Powerful Psychological Strategies for Getting the Job You Want,” these are people who have mastered the job hunt by not only honing their skills but also building up the psychological know-how to get through a sometimes soul-crushing process.  We tapped two of the book's coauthors—Bill Knaus, a psychologist who specializes in personnel selection, and Russell Grieger, a psychologist and organizational consultant—to find out what makes such so-called fearless job hunters tick.    Based on their research, Knaus and Grieger have pinpointed eight key traits that they say make these job-seekers so resilient—and a hiring manager’s dream.  Fearless Trait #1: They Accentuate the Positives  It's easy to feel down on yourself after getting rejected for a dream job, either telling yourself that you're a failure or that you don’t have what it takes to succeed. According to Grieger, that’s because "so many people wrap their self-worth around their careers." There are, however, ways to dig yourself out of that hole of negativity, and approach the process in a more fearless fashion.   First, ask yourself whether what you're thinking is logical—and whether it gets you anywhere. Here’s a hint: The answer to both should be no!  Then flip the script, and tell yourself, "This will be hard, but I can do it," or "I've accomplished a lot in my life, and I'm fully capable of accomplishing this." Even if your career prospects don’t pan out, don’t accept that as the be-all, end-all. Instead, say to yourself, "If I fail at this, it doesn't mean that my whole life is a failure," or "I have a lot to offer—if this interviewer doesn't appreciate it, someone else will."  Finally, give yourself a pep talk by writing down a list of your best qualities as a person, as well as an employee, and then read them aloud. This will help to build up your confidence—and further motivate you during the job hunt.  Fearless Trait #2: They Identify Their Hang-Ups  Does job hunting stress you out so much that you keep putting it off? Once you can confront your specific issues head on, you'll put less stress on yourself—fearless job hunter-style.  Start by pinpointing what could be the underlying cause (or causes) of your particular hang-up, and then “strip away whatever loadstone you have on your back," says Knaus. For instance, if you're nervous that your résumé isn't up to par, ask a mentor to critique it. Or if you're unsure of what to say in an interview, practice with a friend and videotape the session, so you can review it and improve upon your delivery.

You Have a 1.2% Chance of Getting a Job Through an Online Application – How to Increase Your Odds Published on September 25, 2014 Charlotte Weeks Follow Following Unfollow Charlotte Weeks Sign in to follow this author Executive Resume Writer ♦ Executive Career Coach ♦ Outplacement Consultant ♦ Corporate Bio & LinkedIn Profile Writer I recently attended The National Resume Writers’ Association’s annual conference, where I learned of this startling statistic. While I always knew that having an internal company contact was MUCH more effective than applying to open jobs, even I was surprised by this low number. This information was first shared at the Career Thought Leaders conference, where it was provided by Gerry Crispin of Career Xroads (an author of the annual Source of Hire report).  So, does this mean job seekers shouldn’t use job boards anymore? Not in my opinion. They exist for a reason, and I have had many clients get positions this way. However, many, many more have found their roles through a contact, so it makes sense to spend more time and energy on networking than applying online.  Still, if you find a position online that you’d like to apply for (and you don’t have a company contact), you can increase your chances of getting an interview. This can be done by:  1) Making sure you have at least 75% of the qualifications: By taking a less-is-more approach, and only applying to those positions for which you are truly a fit, you’ll save time and be more likely to receive an interview.  2) Optimizing your resume for keywords: Online resumes are often first screened using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Typically, an HR employee will put in hard skills and industry-specific terms that apply to the job. While only the company knows what those keywords will be, the job ad can provide clues. Review each description to make sure that all relevant qualifications you possess are included in your resume.  3) Sending a copy by snail mail: You’ll still need to apply online, but get an extra edge by sending a hard copy. This is rarely done anymore, which is why those that use this method are almost guaranteed to get their resumes read.  4) Following up: If it’s a confidential ad (no company listed) or it says “no calls,” this strategy doesn’t apply. However, those that follow up get their name heard one more time than the hundreds who have applied online – even if you only end up leaving a voicemail. More often than not, you can find someone in your target department through a Google search, reviewing the company’s About Us page, or even just calling the main number.  If you’re going to apply online, give these methods a shot – what do you have to lose?  Charlotte Weeks is the President of Weeks Career Services, Inc.

It’s understandable that not hearing back from employers is often frustrating.  The truth, however, is that there are real people on the other end. They are often sorting through numerous applications each day, hoping to narrow in on the candidates who best meet their needs. Once you’ve found jobs you want to apply for , one of your main goals as a job seeker is to make it crystal clear to those potential employers why you are a great fit for the position.  It’s hard to know exactly what will help you stand out. So, we took a close look at how the most successful job seekers are using Indeed. From this study, we learned that there are several things people do while applying to jobs that, in some cases, dramatically increase their chances of getting a positive response from employers.  These are three habits of highly effective job seekers:  1. Be selective about the jobs you apply for  By far the most important thing you can do in your job search is to carefully evaluate each job you’re applying for. When you find a posting you like, ask yourself if it’s a job you’re qualified for and actually want to do. (Also, review our guidelines for a safe job search and always report suspicious listings.)  When you’re in the middle of a job search, it may feel like you’re increasing your chances of getting a job if you apply for as many jobs as possible. But our analysis of the data shows that may not always be the case. When we look at a month’s worth of applications on Indeed, we find that the group of people submitting the highest number of applications are far less likely to receive a positive response from employers — 39% less likely, in fact.  Here’s the takeaway: The right number of jobs to apply for is going to be different for each person. Instead of focusing on the quantity of applications you submit, put your energy into screening each job carefully so you can craft high quality applications. These are some actions you may want to consider before you apply:   Read the job description from start to finish  Identify what makes this job posting attractive to you  Decide whether you could reasonably do this job by reviewing examples from your background that demonstrate the required skills and qualifications  Take note of any instructions on how to apply  Once you’ve started the application, carefully read and answer any questions  Double check your responses before you submit   While this approach may increase the amount of time you spend upfront, it has the potential to shorten your job search overall because you’re submitting great applications that employers are more likely to respond to.  2. Keep your job search organized  The most successful job seekers approach their search for a new opportunity with discipline. This approach is similar to how you might prepare for an exam or tackle a tough work assignment — you’ll need to set aside enough time and take it on step by step.  One of the easiest ways to stay organized and on task is to use your Indeed account as a hub for all your job searching. In fact, people with an Indeed account are 22% more likely to get a positive response from employers when they apply.  If you’re signed in, you can quickly save jobs as you’re searching and return later to thoroughly evaluate them. You’ll be able to easily see and update the status of each job: saved, applied, interviewing, offered and hired. You can see this information on the My Jobs page of your account.  From your account inbox, you can review any messages you get from employers. You can also more seamlessly manage your email subscriptions : deleting job alerts that may no longer be relevant, pausing alerts you may want later, or adding new ones.  3. Gain back time when you’re filling in applications  Because you’re spending time upfront carefully evaluating each job posting, it’s nice to gain that time back when you’re applying. With an Indeed Resume , applying is fast and you can easily apply on mobile. If you are signed in , applying with your Indeed Resume will be the default option for completing an application when you select “Easily apply.”  Indeed Resume is a clean resume template that lets you fill in your skills and past experience — the more relevant details you add, the more likely you are to get a response from employers. Your resume will be clear and formatted in a way that’s easy to read. If you encounter longer applications, some of the questions can be pre-filled with information from your Indeed Resume.  We see people benefitting immensely from this approach — job seekers who apply using an Indeed Resume are 27% more likely to get a positive response from employers than those who upload a resume file.    Create an Indeed Resume    Remember: your goal is to make it easy for prospective employers to say “yes” to your job application. By putting these habits into practice, you can increase your chances of moving on to the next steps.

Methodology  The findings presented here come from several proprietary Indeed data sources. We examined a sample month of aggregated, anonymous data from job applications submitted in the US via Indeed Apply, a service used by thousands of employers to easily accept applications from any device.  A positive response is a response from an employer provided to Indeed that indicates interest in the candidate. To understand which user behaviors were correlated with receiving a positive response from employers, we split the user data into two groups for each variable: whether they were logged into an Indeed account or not when they applied, whether they created and deleted job alerts or not, whether they were among the users submitting the most applications or not, and whether they used an Indeed Resume while applying or not. We then compared the positive response rate among the two groups and calculated the percent difference.

Thanks to Jobvite’s recent report: “ New Year, New Job: What Job Seekers Need to Know in 2017 ,” you now have valuable insight into the process of job search and better sense of what your chances are for getting a new job in 2017.  Too often, job seekers make assumptions about job search that are not based on facts or realities.  You will learn that:   You’ll be interviewing a lot for your next job.  You’re up against some competition.  You won’t land every job you interview for.   Understand and apply this information so you have a realistic perspective on your job hunt- AND know what you’ll need to do to stand out.  The Interview Process Takes Longer Than You Expect or Want  I’ve always said this. And data proves it. Employers are putting you through more interviews and that takes time.  From the time you apply to the time you are hired takes an average of 28 days according to Jobvite.  Image via Jobvite  What can you do about this? Nothing. Except you can WOW the interviewer by doing these things.  4 Ways To Win Extra Points During Your Next Interview .  How Many Applicants Are Competing  You can expect more competition, but exactly how much more?  Some industries have more competition than others.  As you can see, consumer internet is the most competitive, with over 66 applicants per hire. In case you were wondering, consumer internet companies include gaming, apps, e-commerce, search, social media as well as others. You know the big names in these areas (Google, Zappos, Amazon, etc.). The less-sexy insurance industry jobs don’t see the same level of interest with only 14 applicants per hire.  Based on Jobvite’s data, you can expect the competition to look like this:  Image via Jobvite  You have some choices here- prepare to compete or target industries with less competition (when possible).  5 Tips To Stand Out In Job Search and see how this woman landed her dream job at LinkedIn .  How Many Applicants Get Interviews  There’s no way every applicant will get an interview. The percent of applicants who are invited for an interview is shown below.  As you can see, some industries are quite selective in how many applicants they invite for an interview. Companies in the media industry only invite 7% of applicants, while educational institutions invite 19%.  Image via Jobvite  The best way to convert your candidacy from the reject pile to a phone interview is to tap an insider. Referred candidates stand a much better chance of getting hired than an unknown candidate. Here’s what you need to know about getting referred.  7 Things You Must Know About Getting Referred for a Job  How Many Inteviewees Get Hired?  Not every interview you go on will transfer into an offer. There are many reasons for this. Sometimes you can influence this, other times you can’t.  The chart below can help you understand your odds of getting hired if you’re going through the interview process. In industries like healthcare, energy, insurance and real estate, you’re odds are pretty good at getting an offer if you’re interviewing well.  Image via Jobvite  Prepare well for your interviews and by all means, avoid making these mistakes.  5 Types of Interviewees You Don’t Want To Be  It is my hope that this information will help you conduct a better job search and land a job faster by doing the right things!

Have you ever wondered how certain people seem to have job or internship interviews lined up all of the time? Or why someone you know, who on paper isn’t that much different from you, seemingly has dozens of offers to choose from? While their resume might be similar to yours it's usually their approach to the job search that really ( and literally ) separates them from all of the other people applying.  Understand Your Odds Of Getting An Interview  There are multiple reports on what the average number of applicants per job is and they vary from source to source. Some say 118 applicants per job opening and others say up to 250. Your mileage may vary according to which organization and which industry you’re interested in. The main point is that if you’re only applying to jobs by submitting your application then your resume and application materials are going to be facing a lot of competition.  Know What An Applicant Tracking System Does  Did you know that most organizations now use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). ATS are designed to quickly push out non-qualified applicants by using a set of questions that immediately disqualify people if answered incorrectly. ATS also use keyword filters that grade by the context in which keywords are used, the number of times that they are used as well as where they appear in the resume and application materials. If a person’s keyword score doesn’t past the minimum cut-off score then they’re automatically disqualified as well.  It’s estimated that as much as 50% of applicants are disqualified before their resume even reaches an actual person. Immediately, we see why getting an interview by simply submitting an application is such a rarity.  Take Advantage Of The Employee Referral Option  There are 2 key reasons why it’s better to go through the employee referral route:  1. Most Employee Referrals Get Fast Tracked  2. It’s Usually In The Recruiter’s Best Interest To Hire A Referred Person  Most Employee Referrals Get Fast Tracked  Nelson Schwartz, from the New York Times, recently wrote an article that included great examples highlighting the benefits of being referred by an employee:  “Riju Parakh wasn’t even looking for a new job. But when a friend at Ernst & Young recommended her, Ms. Parakh’s résumé was quickly separated from the thousands the firm receives every week because she was referred by a current employee, and within three weeks she was hired. ‘You know how long this usually takes,’ she said. ‘It was miraculous.’”  “Although Ernst & Young looks at every résumé submitted, ‘a referral puts them in the express lane’ said Larry Nash, director of experienced and executive recruiting there.”  It’s Usually In The Recruiter’s Best Interest To Hire A Referred Person  Put yourself in the hiring manager’s position. Your job is to fill the position with the candidate that you think will be able to add value to your organization. You need to do this while minimizing costs both in the short term (e.g., costs associated with the hire) and in the long run (e.g., costs associated with having to hire someone else at a later point).  If your data shows that applicants hired from a referral have greater job satisfaction and stay longer, and that the recruiting process was shorter and less expensive, then isn’t it in your best interest to hire someone who was referred by someone already working there and who understands the demands and expectations of the job?  Be Strategic And Take The Road Less Traveled  Reports have shown that employee referrals only make up 7% of applicants but that they account for 40% of all hires. Be strategic and understand how going through an employee referral puts you in position to give yourself much better odds.  Not every organization employs an Employee Referral Program (ERP) so it’s important to do your research on organizations you’re interested in to see if they have one in place.  If they do, great. Go to LinkedIn and search for the organization you’re interested in — a list of people of who work there, along with how you’re connected to them, should appear. See who you know there, or who you could get to know, who could refer you. 1st and 2nd level connections are ideal. If you’re thinking about reaching out to a 2nd level connection be sure to reach out to them through one of your 1st level connections first.  If you don’t know anyone there that could potentially refer you then don’t fret. Do like Ryan Holmes, CEO of HootSuite, advises and “use social networks to boost your networking power… start following people in [your] industry on Twitter and connect with them on LinkedIn. Through these networks, research employers and reach out to them through trusted friends and colleagues who might be able to make introductions.”  Ryan also has great advice on expectations when reaching out on social media, saying that “It’s helpful not to expect a set outcome from these encounters, rather to be open-minded. Learn things; get to know people. The best part is that communication doesn’t have to be all that formal. Even just talking about common interests or sharing an interesting article can build trust and open doors.” In addition to social media, his advice on expectations works well for employee referrals too.  And finally if the organization you’re interested in doesn’t have an ERP in place don’t overlook the importance of referrals. Even for the organizations that don’t employ an ERP a referral is still a good way to help set yourself a part from your competition.

If you’re looking for a job in catering, you’ve probably gathered by now that you’re not alone. But with competition for every role, no matter what the level, how do you stand out?    We’ve got 5 easy ways to boost your chances of landing that job.                           1. Sort out your CV (and upload it to our database)  Your CV is the first step in getting noticed by an employer, so it’s not something you can rush in a bid to apply first. Get it wrong and within a few sentences your carefully crafted application is in the bin, but if it’s written well and nicely formatted you’re more likely to catch an employee’s eye for all the right reasons.  But don’t stop at emailing out your application to individual employers, make them come to you as well. By uploading your CV to the Caterer database employers can find you before you’ve even seen their job ad. Who says you have to do all the hard work?  Think your CV could be better? We’ve got some handy hints and simple tips to transform your job application .    2. Prepare thoroughly for interviews  Practice makes perfect, and interviews are no exception. Although you can’t be prepared for everything on the big day, there are some common questions interviewers always tend to ask, no matter what the role is. Remember, employers don’t want you to have a bad interview experience, so try to relax, they’re on your side. Questions you can prepare for include:   1 – So…tell me about yourself  This is normally asked within minutes of every interview, and with a little preparation you won’t be one of the many candidates who come unstuck on it.  The best tip we can give you is to keep your answer short and simple. Tell them about your background, your accomplishments, why you want to work for their company and what your future goals are. If you think you might struggle on this one, look at your CV before you go in to refresh your memory.   2 – Behavioural based questions  Just think of these as an extension of the “tell us about you” questions, as your answers will normally end up referring to your previous roles and experiences. Expect questions like...   Tell me about a time you’ve had to juggle lots of tasks at once  How do you deal with complaining customers?  Describe a time when you have had to get the most out of someone who was under-performing   You get the idea. These questions are easy to plan for, so don’t panic, prepare instead .    3 - Think about your skills  Every job in the hospitality industry requires skill; communication skills and understanding of the check-in process for concierge staff, artistic and culinary skills for chefs or time management and organisation skills for managers .  But whether you’re a newbie to the hospitality industry or have worked in senior management for years, you’re bound to have transferable skills you can bring to any job you want to apply for.  Before you start picking out your interview outfit , try and work out what skills and strengths you have to show off in the interview.  But it’s not just your good features you need to focus on, it’s always good to be aware of your weaknesses too and find out if there are any skills that are lacking on your CV.  Don’t be scared to point out these weaknesses out to prospective employers. By admitting you’re looking to develop more skills and grow on the job, it shows employers you’re not only willing to learn, but that you’re also committed to the hospitality industry.  If you want to start learning new skills and developing existing ones immediately, you could always take up a course or qualifications in a way that suits your schedule and budget.      4 - Research the company BEFORE applying  You want the interviewer to have read your CV before you enter their office, and likewise it’s always good to research a company you want to work for.  Although it’s all well and good doing this a few days before the interview, this is often too late. Researching into a company should come before any sort of application is made, whether you’re apply for a receptionist job in a small restaurant or the area manager of a large hotel chain.  Tailoring your CV and covering letter to suit their company shows you have an interest in that specific role, and haven’t just forwarded the same email to hundreds of other employers. The better impression your initial application makes, the more likely they are to be positive about any interview you get, and so, the more likely you are to get the job.    5 – Submit your application  We know it can be scary applying for a new job, but don’t be afraid to get proactive in your job search. There’s no point doing all this hard work and preparation and then not applying. If you’ve followed this advice then you’re well on your way to a fantastic application and really boosting your chances of being successful.

But most people don't realize how important it is to put your best foot forward as you take that next step, the job interview—otherwise you'll blow your chances and walk away empty-handed. The Problem: You've got the education, experience, and references, all presented on a well-put together resume that gets you job interviews. But you never get a job offer. The harsh truth: Most recruiters and potential employers know within the first five minutes of an interview whether you're right for the job. Even before you have spoken one single word, you are judged by what you look like. The mind and “gut feel” works so fast that within a few minutes a decision has already been made. The Solution: First impressions can get you in the door, but you also want to stay. You'll have an advantage by knowing what recruiters and potential employers are looking for and how they think. The Job Interview Secrets No One Tells You  As the founder of a successful global headhunting firm serving Fortune 500 companies for over twelve years, and author of the books: A Second Life, God is giving you a second chance, and Secrets of the Executive Search Experts, well as self help books on “how to get the job,” I have coached thousands of people who have gotten the jobs they wanted. Some of the secrets I shared with them: How to walk, talk, dress, and look for a job interview  Recruiters and potential employers very often like to recruit people like themselves and, of course, they want employees who will be good representatives for their company. When going for a job interview, you'd better dress the part, so wearing inappropriate clothing won't be a reason for them to reject you. In my younger days even I messed this up by either saying the wrong things or dressing in such a bad way that I am now surprised that I did such a thing. When I was twenty-one, I went to the office of a leading U.S. consulting firm to apply for a part-time job wearing an off-white linen suit and a pink shirt. This was in the late eighties and the outfit was a great going-out-socially outfit at the time, but it was a disaster for the corporate world. I lost the job before I even got to say a word. - How do you know what to wear? There are some universal rules that apply no matter what environment you want to work in. First, a lways dress as though you are worth how much they are going to pay you . When I meet a candidate who dresses like a slacker, my first impression is that he/she isn't worth the money they would be paid. And if someone doesn't have enough respect for himself/herself to dress appropriately, he/she would not be an asset in any job. Look at the environment where you are applying for a job and dress accordingly. If you have to, do reconnaissance. Park or stand near the building where the company is located and see what types of outfits the employees entering or leaving the building are wearing. Or call the company's main number and ask the person who answers the phone what the dress code or preferred attire is for those working there. Always over dress rather than under dress, but don't go so far that you're a total mismatch. Use common sense. When applying for a corporate job, don't come in jeans. When applying for a job in a grocery store, don't wear a dark blue suit with a tie. Always dress your part. And no matter what, you need to look sharp—neat and clean. Remember, for your first interview—and all other interviews that follow—always go in looking like you're ready to do the job you're applying for and will fit right in at the company. That way you'll never be judged or disqualified for the way you dress. - Preview your outfit at home. After studying your potential new work environment and deciding what you're going to wear, put on your outfit and look at yourself in a full-length mirror. Start with your shoes. Do they look worn out and soiled? For men: Do your socks match the shoes and the pants? Are the pants clean, pressed and in good condition? How about your belt, shirt, suit jacket and tie, if they are appropriate? For women: Do your shoes, dress or suit look like a coordinated outfit? Are your clothes clean, pressed and in good condition? For both men and women: Are you well put together? Does what you are wearing represent you? Bottom line, your outfit should all match and be of the best quality possible. I do realize when times are tough or money is tight that you may feel overwhelmed when looking in your closet, thinking you have nothing good enough, new enough or of the appropriate style or quality for the job you want to get. If possible, invest in yourself: Go out and buy an “interview outfit.” When that's not possible, borrow an outfit from a friend. The point is, this may be your opportunity to change your economic circumstances, as well as create a better job/career future, so give it your all. It's also very important to always be well groomed. Trends come and go, such as sideburns, a goat beard or long hair on men, but one thing that never fades or changes in the professional world is looking clean cut, well groomed and professional. In the very competitive job market don't give potential employers any reason to kill your opportunity of getting a job just because you can't bear to part with your ponytail or goat beard (if you're a guy), claiming it's a statement about your authenticity. When you are a player in the job market you have to follow the rules in order to win. - Handshake and eye contact. A limp handshake shows no backbone. If a job candidate grasps too hard, it feels uncomfortable for the other person and it can appear that he/she is trying to prove something. Perfect a handshake that is warm and connecting; firm, but not too hard; and engaging, but not wishy-washy. When it comes to eye contact, look your interviewer straight in the eyes throughout your meeting—unless, of course, they are showing you something, such as a report or a spreadsheet, then give it your full attention. Don't scan the room or look toward the window or down the hallway. People with wandering eyes appear to be not all the way present, which translates to “not really interested or focused.” People who don't maintain eye contact also come across as being insecure, which is a liability in the work world, not an asset. - Always keep structure in a conversation. When communicating with a potential employer, in addition to being well prepared, always have a mental structure in your mind about how the meeting should and will go. In this way you can make sure everything that's important to you gets covered. Also, make sure to get to the point fast. If you have nothing to say, don't just talk. It's annoying. Plus, people who don't convey facts or answer questions directly come across as having something to hide. On several occasions I have presented very strongly qualified and experienced candidates to clients/companies, but for some reason they couldn't get to the point. After an entire hour of social talk, not many facts were conveyed and the clients didn't feel they learned anything about the person. In essence, the job candidates talked themselves out of great job opportunities. During a job interview conversation, always have a structure in mind and make sure that everything gets covered during the allotted time. Your chances of nailing the job will dramatically increase. - Be confident, but be humble. Few companies want to hire a person who comes across as insecure. But they also aren't interested in the other extreme, a person who is cocky. Nobody likes a person who is full of himself/herself. Arrogance doesn't come across as self-confidence, but rather, as insecurity demanding attention. No company wants or needs an employee with that kind of attitude. However, one quality every company looks for in someone to hire is a person who is balanced—confident and humble at the same time. - Humor is important. In every company environment that I have known, humor is key. People with a sense of self-irony are always likeable because they don't take themselves too seriously. A job environment without smiles and laughter is a horrible place to work. Little feels better than having a good laugh. Therefore, job candidates with a sense of humor are much more likeable than a dry person that has a hard time smiling. The stories from the work environment that people remember and tell others are often the funny things that took place. The same goes with when an interviewer meets a well-qualified candidate with self-irony and a sense of humor. Such a person is easy to remember. Being able to put a smile on the face of the person interviewing you is an ice breaker, which gives you an advantage. But don't push it too far by giving the impression you don't take yourself or your job seriously—again, it's all about the balance. Nobody wants to work with a disrespectful clown. And humor can never be at someone else's expense. Job candidates with a smile, who have the ability to connect with others, always have an advantage. And, of course, when everything else is in place they're way ahead of the game. - Physical posture in a meeting. When a job candidate enters the room for their interview with bad posture and looking uncomfortable, the impression they make is just as negative as being inappropriately dressed and unprepared. I have even seen high-profile candidates leaning back in their chairs as if they were at home in their living rooms. It's important when you are in a job interview to sit up straight and behave as professionally as you can. And it is always more engaging if you lean forward a little toward the interviewer as it shows more interest than almost falling off the chair backwards when being too relaxed. - How to follow-up after the interview. After someone takes time out of their busy schedule to meet with you regarding a potential job opportunity, it's customary and a courtesy to always send them a thank you letter or email. This letter or email is very important. It gives you an opportunity to do many things, especially when you are left with the impression that another interview or a job offer may be coming: politely thank them for their time and the opportunity to meet with them  once again state your strong interest in the job  express that you got a great impression of their company  tell them you look forward to the next step in the process  tell them that if they need any more information from you to please let you know  Even if it was clear at the end of your interview that you and the specific job you were interviewing for weren't a good match, a thank you letter is still needed to leave the best possible impression. Include in such a letter: Thank them for their time and tell them what a great impression you got of their company. Also say something like: “If there are any future opportunities that come up that may be a better match for my skills, please keep me in mind.” After all, there's always a chance that could happen. And even if it doesn't, you could directly or indirectly run into that person again in the future. Always leave a good impression. When a friend, acquaintance, someone in your network, or a recruiter has given you the job lead or set up the interview, it's important to thank them too. Thank them for the opportunity and tell them you are excited about it. If a job offer comes through, don't forget to let your contact know with another thank you. And if a recruiter arranged your contact with the company that resulted in a fantastic job, send a gift to the recruiter. Always remember: When someone refers you for a job or hires you, they put their own name and reputation on the line. This is something to be very grateful about. Follow-ups, both after an interview and when you are hired, are critical ways to show gratitude.

You may not be able to land a job even after weeks or months of job search. This is because most of the jobseekers are using specific strategies to stay ahead in the competition. If you don’t want to be left behind in the race, you too need to have an action-plan ready with you. The more time it takes to look for a job, the more frustrated you can become. So, you need to act now!  Given below are seven key tips that you can use to boost your job search and land a job before it’s really too late.    #1. Don’t Look for a Perfect Job  If you ask career experts, they’ll tell you that there’s nothing like a perfect job. You may not always be able to get all you want from a job in a single package, particularly when the going is really tough. Therefore, the first thing that you need to keep in mind while trying to get a new job is ‘let go of perfectionism’. You’ll always have time to find better opportunities when you’ve got a job already.  #2. Gear Up Really Well  Preparation is always the key, whether it’s submitting a resume, applying for a job, attending an interview or meeting with the employer. Make sure all your gears are in good order. Spend adequate time to create an impressive resume. Do remember to tailor your cover letter to the specific requirements of the employer you want to work with.  Take a look at How To Write a Resume – Feel the Employer Pain .  #3. Network Extensively (But not Blindly)  Social or professional networking can bring you amazing results. If you want to boost your chances of landing a job really quickly, you should try to connect with more and more influential people, both offline and online. Attend social and community events where you can get to know new people. Be active on popular social networking websites like Faceboo, Twitter and LinkedIn. In any case, don’t waste your time networking blinding. Always connect with those people who you think can bring you career benefits in some way or the other.

And it’s so easy to get frustrated when you see no results from your job search. Not every employer will want to hire you. Hiring managers will offer you a job only when they are fully convinced of your potential and how you can help their company with your skills. Even if you are rejected in your first few attempts, you need to continue with your job search. If it’s really taking longer than what you expected, you need to review your strategy and modify the action plan.  #5. Focus on Getting Your Foot in the Door First  If you really want to boost your chances of getting a job, you should first try to get your foot in the door. The first break is important. Unless you get your first break in the industry, you can’t build the work experience that you’ll need to negotiate better job or career opportunities.  #6. Also Target Regional Job Websites  Don’t make potential job search mistakes like many others do. While it’s always advisable to submit your resume to the major job boards, it’s also a useful recommendation not to ignore regional job sites. Try to find jobs in your own location by visiting job sites that focus on a specific region.  Have a look at the Riley Guide or Job-Hunt.org for job board directories.  #7. Don’t Ignore Temporary Jobs  Getting a temporary job is always better than sitting unemployed. Since these are really lean times, you shouldn’t completely ignore temporary jobs. Many companies hire candidates for temporarily. If it’s one with a potential employer, you should grab it quickly. Who knows when this temporary job can turn into a full-time job position. Just give your 100 percent to whatever job you take up and try to showcase your most essential and unique skills.
