You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

One in 10? One in 50? One in 100? If you're over 62, your odds of having at least $1 million in net wealth (your total assets minus your total debt) are relatively achievable — about 1 in 7. But if you are under 40, your odds are low: 1 in 55. In the last 25 years, the odds that an old person is a millionaire have improved slightly. But for young people, they have gotten much worse. These figures come from a new paper by economists at the St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability, which shows evidence of a growing wealth gap that few people are talking about — the gap between the young and the old. The paper, by William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, draws on surveys of 40,000 families that the Fed carried out between 1989 and 2013 to examine the all-important role that your age plays in how much income you make and how much wealth you accumulate. It offers a few clues as to how young people can game the system and end up like their wealthy older counterparts, as well as a lot of evidence to show that things are just different for young people today. One of the most important points that the paper makes is that everyone's income and wealth tend to follow a kind of natural pattern during their life. Young people (generally defined here as those under 40) haven't been working for many years, so they don't have an opportunity to save as much; they also need to make investments in things like education and new home ownership. Middle-aged people (40-61) have been working long enough that they start to accumulate wealth rapidly. And old people (62 and up) begin to draw down on their wealth, to finance their retirement. You can see these trends in this incredible graph below, from their paper. People born in different years (1901, 1904, 1907 and so on) were surveyed at various times between 1989 and 2013 about their median family income. The chart below shows their age on the horizontal axis, and the median family income they reported making at the time on the vertical axis. The slope of each of the different colored lines shows how income was changing for that group between 1989 and 2013. For example, for the youngest generations, who appear on the left-hand side of the graph, the lines sharply slope upward because their net income is rising. World Economic Forum Here's the same graph for wealth (assets minus debt), rather than income. If you compare this with the previous chart, you can see that net worth takes a longer time to amass than income, and then declines less slowly. That's partly because a lot of people take on debt at the beginning of their lives — student debt, mortgages, etc — and thus have negative net worth. It's also because people lose their incomes as they retire, but tend to hold on to their largest sources of net worth, like their homes. World Economic Forum From bad to worse Basically, young people have always been poor. But looking beyond that basic trend, you can see that today's young people are poorer than young people of the past. The period of time in which someone is born can also have a dramatic effect on their wealth compared with other generations. The winners of this historical jackpot appear to be those who were born between 1930 and 1945 and came of age after World War II, who are sometimes called The Silent Generation. Both the Silent Generation and the generation that came before them, called The Greatest Generation because they fought in World War II, benefited from America's rapid economic growth after World War II. (As Thomas Piketty describes in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, this was not necessarily a happy story: The U.S. grew so fast after World War II because it was the only place in the world with manufacturing capacity - Europe had literally been leveled.) But The Silent Generation appears to get an additional boost because they were born during the Great Depression, a time when people had fewer babies overall. Their lower population meant that they had less competition overall for jobs, housing, investments and other opportunities. Sociologist Elwood Carlson called the generation "the lucky few" because they were smaller than the generation that came before. African-Americans and women born in those years had far more opportunity, and the generation also benefited from the expansion of the American safety net, including Social Security and Medicare, during their lives. YouTube/The Pilion Trust Charity "People born in the first half of the 20th century simply may have been in the right place at the right time as they were lifted by a rising tide," the economists write. Then came the Baby Boomers, the populous generation born after World War II. They haven't fared as well as their predecessors, in part because their greater numbers have meant more competition, and perhaps in part because the world is just a different place. The Boomers were the first generation to really experience the effects of globalization and competition from workers in the developing world. That, as well as automation and the decline of labor unions have all eroded wage growth on the lower end of the income spectrum. The charts below illustrate this difference. A sliver of the Greatest Generation, born in 1915-1917, is represented on the far right side of both graphs in teal. Part of the Silent Generation (born 1933-1935) appears in cornflower blue, while some Boomers (born 1954-1956) appear in beige. The horizontal axis shows the person's age, and the vertical axis shows their income (on the left) or median net worth (on the right). If you look at Figure 3 on the right, you can see how much better the Silent Generation did than the generations that came before or after them. Notice where the blue line overlaps with the teal line — that shows that those born between 1933 and 1935 had a much higher net worth in their 70's than those born between 1915 and 1917. In the same graph, the overlap between the blue line and the beige line shows that the Silent Generation also had a higher net worth than the Boomers did when both generations were in their mid to late 50's. World Economic Forum William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability In just 25 years, the wealth gap between young and old people has yawned wider. In 1989, old families had 7.6 times as much median wealth as young families. By 2013, it had grown to 14.7 times. According to the economists' calculations, someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than an identical person born in 1940. It's not clear exactly why this is, the economists say. The financial crisis and Great Recession certainly set young people back, but young people were doing comparatively worse even before that. And the trends are true even though America's younger generations are its most educated ever. Part of the reason could be that younger Americans are far more diverse than older generations, and race- and ethnicity-based disadvantages continue to loom large in the U.S., the economists say. White and Asian families are far wealthier than black and Hispanic families in the U.S., across all age groups. Flickr The difference may also be due to the difference in financial decisions between young and old people. Old people generally have more diverse investments, carry less debt and are more cushioned against financial shocks than younger people. If young people want to increase their chances of being wealthy, one strategy is to emulate the behavior of older people: keeping an emergency fund, paying down debt, avoiding high-cost credit, and putting money into higher-returning investments, the economists say. One strategy that might work for young people is delaying the purchase of a house. By doing so, young people can save and make a bigger down payment later, and thus lower their debt burden, as well as make more diverse investments in the interim. But even if Millennials and Gen Xers follow these strategies, the historical trends don't appear to be on their side. "Some people are just born lucky," the economists conclude.

What had to happen in order for everything to come together so you could exist? Subscribe: https://youtube.com/c/allourquestions... It's mind blowing to think about all of the things that had to be in place for you to be born. Just from the beginning of the Earth an immeasurable amount of events have taken place to bring you into existence. For example, the chances of your mother meeting your father and staying together long enough to have a child is slim. Multiply that by every person in your family tree all the way back to the first living organism. In addition to the obvious variables of the parents, you also have the chances of the Earth being in the right location in the universe and having the right environment that would last long enough to give you life. People have figured out vague numbers of the odds of your existence but in reality, there are too many variables to really nail down any exact odds because in calculating the odds there always has to be a starting point and the odds of that starting point being there are also immeasurable. Whatever the odds of you being born...you...remember that your existence is an amazing accomplishment against uncountable odds. Do something cool with it.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don’t matter. The fact you’re alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you…   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let’s remember there are people out there that can’t eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don’t feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that “it” may be. Unfortunately, people aren’t grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don’t have. When you see regret in a person’s eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn’t. No matter the shit hand you’re dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don’t care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you’re actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

What are the odds?  What are the odds that you exist, as you, today? Author Ali Binazir attemps to quantify the probability that you came about and exist as you today, and reveals that the odds of you existing are almost zero.  LET'S START SMALL What is the probability of your dad meeting your mom? Though the world was smaller 20 years ago, your dad could have met almost 200 million of its women (go dad!) But over 25 years, he probably met around 10,000 women. So the odds that your mom was in this small group and met your dad is: 1 in 20,000  BUT WE KNOW HOW TRICKY LOVE CAN BE. What is the probability that they stay together long enough to have kids? It is a 1 in 10 chance that they talk to each other. Also a 1 in 10 chance that they go on a second date. Another 1 in 10 chance that they keep dating for a while. And a coin toss if they stay together long enough for offspring. Thus, the odds that your parents' meeting results in kids is: 1 in 2,000  So far, the combines odds of you being here are: 1 in 40,000,000 That is about the size of the population of California.  NOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET PRETTY INTERESTING Why? Because we are about to deal with eggs and sperm, which come in large numbers. Mom has about 100,000 eggs in her lifetime. Dad makes about 4 trillion sperm during the years you could have been born.  What are the odds that the 1 egg... (Sally)... ...met the 1 sperm, which together made you(and not your brother)? (Harry) 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 400 quadrillion)That is approximately the volume in cubic meters of the Atlantic Ocean (3,236x10 17 cubic meters).  BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED Because your existence here, now, and on planet earth presupposes another supremely unlikely and utterly undeniable chain of events. Namely, that every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age- going all the way back not just to the first Homo sapiens, first Homo erectus and Homo habilis, but all the way back to the first single-celled organism. You are a representative of an unbroken lineage of life going back 4 billion years.  What are the odds that you lineage remained unbroken for the length of human existence? (You.Aw.) 1 in 2 odds that a child will be born, grow, and reproduce per generation... ... for 150,000 generations  1 in 10  45,000 That's a 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it.  How large is that number? That number is not just larger than all the particles in the universe-it is larger that all the particles in the universe if each particle were itself a universe.  THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. The right sperm also had to meet the right egg for every single one of those ancestors.  (Weeeee!) ODDS OF THE RIGHT SPERM, MEETING THE RIGHT EGG 150,000 TIMES? 1 in 10 2,640,000 That is 1 quadrillion multiplied by 1 quadrillion for every generation.  Let's add it all up  10 2,640,000 x 10 45,000 x 2000 x 20,000= 1 in 10 2,685,000  BY COMPARISON: The number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg. 175 lb) is about: 10 27 The number of atoms making up the earth is about: 10 50 The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at: 10 80  THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: It is the probability of 2 million people getting together (about the population of San Diego) each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up with the exact same number-for example, 550,343,279,001.  SO, THE ODDS THAT YOU EXIST AT ALL ARE: BASICALLY ZERO.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, we have just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and ac like the miracle that you are.

This is not a religious question so please keep religion for another thread. This is something that interests me purely in a `law of averages` kind of a way. The premise is this.  If we believe the big bang then everything came from nothing after the bang. Even if the big bang is not correct there was a point for all of us when we did not exist, and then through the law of averages, coincidence, natural selection, call it what you will, things came together and we were all born. At some point we will die.  So what's to say this cycle will not happen again and is there any scientific evidence to suggest it might? Or is it a one chance only scenario?  Don't forget that once we die time has no meaning, as it had no meaning before we were born. So many big bangs could happen, many trillion of years could pass in the blink of an eye until we are born again.  It happened once so why not multiple times? Of course we would not be aware of our previous existence so don't go down that route please.  I would be interested in your thoughts. I like the idea that once I die I may get the chance to live again someday.                     28th August 2011, 17:57    #2           pagen01    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Visit Homepage      St Mawganphile        Join Date  Aug 2007  Location  At St Athan but from St Mawgan  Posts  10,711                Originally Posted by hampden98    I like the idea that once I die I may get the chance to live again someday.

Everything we know of is born and then dies, even planets, Suns and galaxys, so why not the universe? Its just a lot longer in time.  Who knows we could have had this converstion a billion times, being born a billion times, each time the universe ends it is reborn and starts again.  However the chances of everything happening the same way if the universe was reborn is highly unlikely but still its an interesting thought        Last edited by stevo76; 28th August 2011 at 18:56 .                    28th August 2011, 19:04    #6        Sky High    View Profile    View Forum Posts      Always Hopeful        Join Date  Oct 2009  Location  Kent  Posts  5,003          Linc - but that's the point you will not experience the parallel universe, unless you fall into a wormhole.  Stevo - a very relevant thought. But the general consensus, I believe, is that the universe is expanding to infinity.    What really matters is what you do with what you have.

It is expanding now so they say but we have no concept of what we can't see from out little planet and what we can see is most likely a very small portion of the universe and our life as humans just isnt long enough to know what happens a billion years in the future.  Our lungs expand when we breath in to something on the scale of an atom that expanse is huge but to us its only small, then when we breath out it collapses back to its orignal size.  We could say and its as good a guess as anyones that once the universe stops breathing in it will breath out and theoretically reduce to its original size.  Wouldnt want to be around then though I dont actually beleive in the theory of the big bang anyway seems to far fetched  And as a scientist once said in a documentary...well it was something like 'as Scientists we acually know very little, everything we work from is theory based on theory based on theory and if we remove one of the theories everything will collapse"     Last edited by stevo76; 28th August 2011 at 19:22 .                    28th August 2011, 19:40    #9        Sky High    View Profile    View Forum Posts      Always Hopeful        Join Date  Oct 2009  Location  Kent  Posts  5,003          Yes.

Actor Glenn Ford visited a grave in a cathedral in my home town of Elgin, Moray. He was absolutely convinced he was a music teacher named Charles Stuart, who died in Elgin in 1840. Under hypnosis he recalled another life as a French cavalryman, in the reign of Louis XIV. Ford only knew a few basic phrases in French, but under regression, the UCLA discovered he was speaking fluently in a 17th century Parisian dialect...

This very concept was recently demonstrated on that well know fountain of philosophical wisdom "Futurama"  Professor Farnsworth builds a time machine, but it can only go forwards in time. Due to Farnsworths clumsy operation of the controls & an abortive quest trying to find a race that had developed a "backwards in time machine" they end up many millions of years in the future, but find that if they just keep going, the universe eventually collapses in on itself & another big bang is created thus making history repeat itself, of course it takes several attempts & a few times around the clock for our heroes to get it right.  I like Futurama.  So in Matt Groenings world, it's a yes, you can be born as many times as a series will permit, in mine, it's a big don't know      Last edited by Dr Strangelove; 29th August 2011 at 11:24 .

That brings to mind a remark I saw or heard years ago which I agree with- the more we learn the more we realise how little we know.

But there has never been sufficient evidence to enable a scientific proposition to be tested. If there were, I am sure it would be.    What really matters is what you do with what you have.

I'd love to give an exact figure, but it depends on how many fundamental molecular structures you contain and the number of possible combinations....  As for the idea that your memories and experiences could be transferred into another body several hundred years later- utter tosh. Kindly explain how a mixture of chemical and electrical signals could transgress space and time...   Spiritualists may have a plan... The idea that this 'LIFE' is no more than a learning playground is interesting, and may explain why some of the laws of physics are not particularly good too.... Think of a self imposed 'Matrix' (as in the film) where you pre-ordain what you want to acheive in life whether that be immense suffering, a long marriage (its the same thing...) or whatever. There is a line of thought within Spiritualism that in the 'real' world, we are close to about ten people, and it is these ten people who will be your companions through every life, but often in different forms - for example, your best mate could have actually been your dad or your wife (!) in a former life. Apparently its the richness and the diversity that life has to offer that is the learning experience.

So the answer then is yes. What are the odds of those molecules comming together to make each of us. Must be similar odds to them re-creating each of us. Might take zillions of years but could happen.                     30th August 2011, 16:30    #26        JT442    View Profile    View Forum Posts      Rank 5 Registered User        Join Date  Oct 2010  Posts  921          The odds are the same as my ability to spell 'scientific'......  There is a slight error in what I said - the molecules would have to be the SAME ONES for true scientific re-incarnation - in otherwords, every atomic particle in your body reforming EXACTLY as it is now. Simply put, not going to happen with an almost infinite number of re-assembly options. To be honest, your body will revert to the core elements of which it is composed over time, and you will be spread across the planet, the galaxy and ultimately the universe VERY thinly..... You are composed of waste material from the stars, and that is all you will be in the future.... unless you have aspirations at an atomic level of being part of a rock...

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

One in 10? One in 50? One in 100? If you're over 62, your odds of having at least $1 million in net wealth (your total assets minus your total debt) are relatively achievable — about 1 in 7. But if you are under 40, your odds are low: 1 in 55. In the last 25 years, the odds that an old person is a millionaire have improved slightly. But for young people, they have gotten much worse. These figures come from a new paper by economists at the St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability, which shows evidence of a growing wealth gap that few people are talking about — the gap between the young and the old. The paper, by William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, draws on surveys of 40,000 families that the Fed carried out between 1989 and 2013 to examine the all-important role that your age plays in how much income you make and how much wealth you accumulate. It offers a few clues as to how young people can game the system and end up like their wealthy older counterparts, as well as a lot of evidence to show that things are just different for young people today. One of the most important points that the paper makes is that everyone's income and wealth tend to follow a kind of natural pattern during their life. Young people (generally defined here as those under 40) haven't been working for many years, so they don't have an opportunity to save as much; they also need to make investments in things like education and new home ownership. Middle-aged people (40-61) have been working long enough that they start to accumulate wealth rapidly. And old people (62 and up) begin to draw down on their wealth, to finance their retirement. You can see these trends in this incredible graph below, from their paper. People born in different years (1901, 1904, 1907 and so on) were surveyed at various times between 1989 and 2013 about their median family income. The chart below shows their age on the horizontal axis, and the median family income they reported making at the time on the vertical axis. The slope of each of the different colored lines shows how income was changing for that group between 1989 and 2013. For example, for the youngest generations, who appear on the left-hand side of the graph, the lines sharply slope upward because their net income is rising. World Economic Forum Here's the same graph for wealth (assets minus debt), rather than income. If you compare this with the previous chart, you can see that net worth takes a longer time to amass than income, and then declines less slowly. That's partly because a lot of people take on debt at the beginning of their lives — student debt, mortgages, etc — and thus have negative net worth. It's also because people lose their incomes as they retire, but tend to hold on to their largest sources of net worth, like their homes. World Economic Forum From bad to worse Basically, young people have always been poor. But looking beyond that basic trend, you can see that today's young people are poorer than young people of the past. The period of time in which someone is born can also have a dramatic effect on their wealth compared with other generations. The winners of this historical jackpot appear to be those who were born between 1930 and 1945 and came of age after World War II, who are sometimes called The Silent Generation. Both the Silent Generation and the generation that came before them, called The Greatest Generation because they fought in World War II, benefited from America's rapid economic growth after World War II. (As Thomas Piketty describes in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, this was not necessarily a happy story: The U.S. grew so fast after World War II because it was the only place in the world with manufacturing capacity - Europe had literally been leveled.) But The Silent Generation appears to get an additional boost because they were born during the Great Depression, a time when people had fewer babies overall. Their lower population meant that they had less competition overall for jobs, housing, investments and other opportunities. Sociologist Elwood Carlson called the generation "the lucky few" because they were smaller than the generation that came before. African-Americans and women born in those years had far more opportunity, and the generation also benefited from the expansion of the American safety net, including Social Security and Medicare, during their lives. YouTube/The Pilion Trust Charity "People born in the first half of the 20th century simply may have been in the right place at the right time as they were lifted by a rising tide," the economists write. Then came the Baby Boomers, the populous generation born after World War II. They haven't fared as well as their predecessors, in part because their greater numbers have meant more competition, and perhaps in part because the world is just a different place. The Boomers were the first generation to really experience the effects of globalization and competition from workers in the developing world. That, as well as automation and the decline of labor unions have all eroded wage growth on the lower end of the income spectrum. The charts below illustrate this difference. A sliver of the Greatest Generation, born in 1915-1917, is represented on the far right side of both graphs in teal. Part of the Silent Generation (born 1933-1935) appears in cornflower blue, while some Boomers (born 1954-1956) appear in beige. The horizontal axis shows the person's age, and the vertical axis shows their income (on the left) or median net worth (on the right). If you look at Figure 3 on the right, you can see how much better the Silent Generation did than the generations that came before or after them. Notice where the blue line overlaps with the teal line — that shows that those born between 1933 and 1935 had a much higher net worth in their 70's than those born between 1915 and 1917. In the same graph, the overlap between the blue line and the beige line shows that the Silent Generation also had a higher net worth than the Boomers did when both generations were in their mid to late 50's. World Economic Forum William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability In just 25 years, the wealth gap between young and old people has yawned wider. In 1989, old families had 7.6 times as much median wealth as young families. By 2013, it had grown to 14.7 times. According to the economists' calculations, someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than an identical person born in 1940. It's not clear exactly why this is, the economists say. The financial crisis and Great Recession certainly set young people back, but young people were doing comparatively worse even before that. And the trends are true even though America's younger generations are its most educated ever. Part of the reason could be that younger Americans are far more diverse than older generations, and race- and ethnicity-based disadvantages continue to loom large in the U.S., the economists say. White and Asian families are far wealthier than black and Hispanic families in the U.S., across all age groups. Flickr The difference may also be due to the difference in financial decisions between young and old people. Old people generally have more diverse investments, carry less debt and are more cushioned against financial shocks than younger people. If young people want to increase their chances of being wealthy, one strategy is to emulate the behavior of older people: keeping an emergency fund, paying down debt, avoiding high-cost credit, and putting money into higher-returning investments, the economists say. One strategy that might work for young people is delaying the purchase of a house. By doing so, young people can save and make a bigger down payment later, and thus lower their debt burden, as well as make more diverse investments in the interim. But even if Millennials and Gen Xers follow these strategies, the historical trends don't appear to be on their side. "Some people are just born lucky," the economists conclude.

It's mind blowing to think about all of the things that had to be in place for you to be born. Just from the beginning of the Earth an immeasurable amount of events have taken place to bring you into existence. For example, the chances of your mother meeting your father and staying together long enough to have a child is slim. Multiply that by every person in your family tree all the way back to the first living organism. In addition to the obvious variables of the parents, you also have the chances of the Earth being in the right location in the universe and having the right environment that would last long enough to give you life. People have figured out vague numbers of the odds of your existence but in reality, there are too many variables to really nail down any exact odds because in calculating the odds there always has to be a starting point and the odds of that starting point being there are also immeasurable. Whatever the odds of you being born...you...remember that your existence is an amazing accomplishment against uncountable odds. Do something cool with it.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don’t matter. The fact you’re alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you…   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let’s remember there are people out there that can’t eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don’t feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that “it” may be. Unfortunately, people aren’t grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don’t have. When you see regret in a person’s eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn’t. No matter the shit hand you’re dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don’t care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you’re actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

What are the odds?  What are the odds that you exist, as you, today? Author Ali Binazir attemps to quantify the probability that you came about and exist as you today, and reveals that the odds of you existing are almost zero.  LET'S START SMALL What is the probability of your dad meeting your mom? Though the world was smaller 20 years ago, your dad could have met almost 200 million of its women (go dad!) But over 25 years, he probably met around 10,000 women. So the odds that your mom was in this small group and met your dad is: 1 in 20,000  BUT WE KNOW HOW TRICKY LOVE CAN BE. What is the probability that they stay together long enough to have kids? It is a 1 in 10 chance that they talk to each other. Also a 1 in 10 chance that they go on a second date. Another 1 in 10 chance that they keep dating for a while. And a coin toss if they stay together long enough for offspring. Thus, the odds that your parents' meeting results in kids is: 1 in 2,000  So far, the combines odds of you being here are: 1 in 40,000,000 That is about the size of the population of California.  NOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET PRETTY INTERESTING Why? Because we are about to deal with eggs and sperm, which come in large numbers. Mom has about 100,000 eggs in her lifetime. Dad makes about 4 trillion sperm during the years you could have been born.  What are the odds that the 1 egg... (Sally)... ...met the 1 sperm, which together made you(and not your brother)? (Harry) 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 400 quadrillion)That is approximately the volume in cubic meters of the Atlantic Ocean (3,236x10 17 cubic meters).  BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED Because your existence here, now, and on planet earth presupposes another supremely unlikely and utterly undeniable chain of events. Namely, that every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age- going all the way back not just to the first Homo sapiens, first Homo erectus and Homo habilis, but all the way back to the first single-celled organism. You are a representative of an unbroken lineage of life going back 4 billion years.  What are the odds that you lineage remained unbroken for the length of human existence? (You.Aw.) 1 in 2 odds that a child will be born, grow, and reproduce per generation... ... for 150,000 generations  1 in 10  45,000 That's a 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it.  How large is that number? That number is not just larger than all the particles in the universe-it is larger that all the particles in the universe if each particle were itself a universe.  THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. The right sperm also had to meet the right egg for every single one of those ancestors.  (Weeeee!) ODDS OF THE RIGHT SPERM, MEETING THE RIGHT EGG 150,000 TIMES? 1 in 10 2,640,000 That is 1 quadrillion multiplied by 1 quadrillion for every generation.  Let's add it all up  10 2,640,000 x 10 45,000 x 2000 x 20,000= 1 in 10 2,685,000  BY COMPARISON: The number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg. 175 lb) is about: 10 27 The number of atoms making up the earth is about: 10 50 The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at: 10 80  THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: It is the probability of 2 million people getting together (about the population of San Diego) each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up with the exact same number-for example, 550,343,279,001.  SO, THE ODDS THAT YOU EXIST AT ALL ARE: BASICALLY ZERO.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, we have just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and ac like the miracle that you are.

This is not a religious question so please keep religion for another thread. This is something that interests me purely in a `law of averages` kind of a way. The premise is this.  If we believe the big bang then everything came from nothing after the bang. Even if the big bang is not correct there was a point for all of us when we did not exist, and then through the law of averages, coincidence, natural selection, call it what you will, things came together and we were all born. At some point we will die.  So what's to say this cycle will not happen again and is there any scientific evidence to suggest it might? Or is it a one chance only scenario?  Don't forget that once we die time has no meaning, as it had no meaning before we were born. So many big bangs could happen, many trillion of years could pass in the blink of an eye until we are born again.  It happened once so why not multiple times? Of course we would not be aware of our previous existence so don't go down that route please.  I would be interested in your thoughts. I like the idea that once I die I may get the chance to live again someday.                     28th August 2011, 17:57    #2           pagen01    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Visit Homepage      St Mawganphile        Join Date  Aug 2007  Location  At St Athan but from St Mawgan  Posts  10,711                Originally Posted by hampden98    I like the idea that once I die I may get the chance to live again someday.

Everything we know of is born and then dies, even planets, Suns and galaxys, so why not the universe? Its just a lot longer in time.  Who knows we could have had this converstion a billion times, being born a billion times, each time the universe ends it is reborn and starts again.  However the chances of everything happening the same way if the universe was reborn is highly unlikely but still its an interesting thought        Last edited by stevo76; 28th August 2011 at 18:56 .                    28th August 2011, 19:04    #6        Sky High    View Profile    View Forum Posts      Always Hopeful        Join Date  Oct 2009  Location  Kent  Posts  5,003          Linc - but that's the point you will not experience the parallel universe, unless you fall into a wormhole.  Stevo - a very relevant thought. But the general consensus, I believe, is that the universe is expanding to infinity.    What really matters is what you do with what you have.

She said she would like to come back as a cow.

It is expanding now so they say but we have no concept of what we can't see from out little planet and what we can see is most likely a very small portion of the universe and our life as humans just isnt long enough to know what happens a billion years in the future.  Our lungs expand when we breath in to something on the scale of an atom that expanse is huge but to us its only small, then when we breath out it collapses back to its orignal size.  We could say and its as good a guess as anyones that once the universe stops breathing in it will breath out and theoretically reduce to its original size.  Wouldnt want to be around then though I dont actually beleive in the theory of the big bang anyway seems to far fetched  And as a scientist once said in a documentary...well it was something like 'as Scientists we acually know very little, everything we work from is theory based on theory based on theory and if we remove one of the theories everything will collapse"     Last edited by stevo76; 28th August 2011 at 19:22 .                    28th August 2011, 19:40    #9        Sky High    View Profile    View Forum Posts      Always Hopeful        Join Date  Oct 2009  Location  Kent  Posts  5,003          Yes.

Actor Glenn Ford visited a grave in a cathedral in my home town of Elgin, Moray. He was absolutely convinced he was a music teacher named Charles Stuart, who died in Elgin in 1840. Under hypnosis he recalled another life as a French cavalryman, in the reign of Louis XIV. Ford only knew a few basic phrases in French, but under regression, the UCLA discovered he was speaking fluently in a 17th century Parisian dialect...

This very concept was recently demonstrated on that well know fountain of philosophical wisdom "Futurama"  Professor Farnsworth builds a time machine, but it can only go forwards in time. Due to Farnsworths clumsy operation of the controls & an abortive quest trying to find a race that had developed a "backwards in time machine" they end up many millions of years in the future, but find that if they just keep going, the universe eventually collapses in on itself & another big bang is created thus making history repeat itself, of course it takes several attempts & a few times around the clock for our heroes to get it right.  I like Futurama.  So in Matt Groenings world, it's a yes, you can be born as many times as a series will permit, in mine, it's a big don't know      Last edited by Dr Strangelove; 29th August 2011 at 11:24 .

That brings to mind a remark I saw or heard years ago which I agree with- the more we learn the more we realise how little we know.

But there has never been sufficient evidence to enable a scientific proposition to be tested. If there were, I am sure it would be.    What really matters is what you do with what you have.

I'd love to give an exact figure, but it depends on how many fundamental molecular structures you contain and the number of possible combinations....  As for the idea that your memories and experiences could be transferred into another body several hundred years later- utter tosh. Kindly explain how a mixture of chemical and electrical signals could transgress space and time...   Spiritualists may have a plan... The idea that this 'LIFE' is no more than a learning playground is interesting, and may explain why some of the laws of physics are not particularly good too.... Think of a self imposed 'Matrix' (as in the film) where you pre-ordain what you want to acheive in life whether that be immense suffering, a long marriage (its the same thing...) or whatever. There is a line of thought within Spiritualism that in the 'real' world, we are close to about ten people, and it is these ten people who will be your companions through every life, but often in different forms - for example, your best mate could have actually been your dad or your wife (!) in a former life. Apparently its the richness and the diversity that life has to offer that is the learning experience.

So the answer then is yes. What are the odds of those molecules comming together to make each of us. Must be similar odds to them re-creating each of us. Might take zillions of years but could happen.                     30th August 2011, 16:30    #26        JT442    View Profile    View Forum Posts      Rank 5 Registered User        Join Date  Oct 2010  Posts  921          The odds are the same as my ability to spell 'scientific'......  There is a slight error in what I said - the molecules would have to be the SAME ONES for true scientific re-incarnation - in otherwords, every atomic particle in your body reforming EXACTLY as it is now. Simply put, not going to happen with an almost infinite number of re-assembly options. To be honest, your body will revert to the core elements of which it is composed over time, and you will be spread across the planet, the galaxy and ultimately the universe VERY thinly..... You are composed of waste material from the stars, and that is all you will be in the future.... unless you have aspirations at an atomic level of being part of a rock...
