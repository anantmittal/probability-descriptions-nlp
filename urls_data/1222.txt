Credit: Carlos Caetano | Shutterstock     BOSTON — Many people have suffered from impacted third molars, also known as wisdom teeth. But there are also a lucky few who are missing a wisdom tooth or two (or even all four). Why do some people have wisdom teeth, while others don't?  The answer, partly hinted at in new research presented here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , could also explain why particular ethnic groups, such as the Inuit, have a particularly low occurrence of wisdom teeth.  Some thousands of years ago, a random mutation arose which suppressed the formation of wisdom teeth, a trait that then spread and now accounts for the lack of wisdom teeth among some modern humans, said Princeton University researcher Alan Mann.  The oldest fossils missing third molars hail from China and are about 300,000 to 400,000 years old, suggesting the first mutation may have arisen there, Mann told LiveScience.  Like most mammals, humans' ancestors had four sets of three molars (for a total of 12, with six in both the upper and lower jaw) used to help chew and grind food. Unlike other mammals, however, humans underwent a period of evolution in which the brain greatly expanded in size , Mann said. This created an architectural problem; with a much larger brain case, the jaw had to become narrower so that it could still connect to the lower part of the skull, Mann said.  Genes that control the quantity of teeth, however, evolve independently from those that control brain development, Mann's research has shown. This led to a mismatch, in which the human jaw was no longer large enough, in many cases, to give wisdom teeth room to erupt through the gums.  Impacted third molars (teeth that do not make it out of the gums) can become infected, leading to serious health problems. Even more commonly, however, wisdom teeth cause severe pain . This fact alone could help explain how the lack of wisdom teeth evolved, Mann said: The pain could make one less likely to reproduce. That would favor people with the mutation, who would suffer less pain, he added. [ Top 10 Useless Limbs (and Other Vestigial Organs) ]  "Imagine a scenario where one evening a person is in serious pain from an impacted third molar," Mann said. "Their partner comes up and says, 'How about a bout of reproduction?' And the person says, 'Not tonight, dear, my jaws are killing me.'"  Perhaps 10 to 25 percent of Americans of European ancestry are missing at least one third molar, Mann said. For African Americans and Asian Americans, the figure is 11 percent and 40 percent, respectively, he said. But the Inuit, a group of people who live in the Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland and Alaska, have the fewest wisdom teeth ; about 45 percent of them lack one or more third molar, he said.  There are probably a couple reasons for this. For one, this group originated in Asia, where the oldest fossils lacking wisdom teeth were found, Mann said. Secondly, like other Asians, the Inuit tend to have flatter faces (when compared to Europeans and Africans), meaning they have even narrower jaws, leaving less room for teeth, he said. Third, Inuit teeth also tend to be larger than average, meaning that this mutation would be even more advantageous in this population, Mann said.   Reach Douglas Main at dmain@techmedianetwork.com .

Menu Requires Javascript            Wisdom FAQ   What are wisdom teeth? Wisdom teeth (or third molars) are the last teeth to erupt into the mouth and are the furthest teeth from the front of the mouth. At what age do wisdom teeth erupt? Wisdom teeth usually erupt between the ages of 18-21 but this can vary between patients Does everyone have wisdom teeth? No, some people have all four wisdom teeth, some have one, two or three and some even have none. Do wisdom teeth always cause problems and need removal? No, in many cases, wisdom teeth erupt fully into the mouth into full function and behave exactly like any other tooth. Where a wisdom tooth remains fully buried, often it can be left alone if it is expected not to cause any problems. Diseased or potentially problematic wisdom teeth should be removed. What are the reasons for wisdom tooth removal? -Infection around a partially erupted wisdom tooth -Unrestorable decay or badly broken down tooth -Decay of the adjacent tooth caused by the wisdom tooth -Cyst formation etc -For orthodontic or prosthetic reasons  Why are wisdom teeth more difficult to remove than other teeth? This is because of a number of factors; -The jaw bone in this area is particularly dense -The roots of wisdom teeth can be multiple and at unfavourable angulations -The wisdom tooth is often partially covered by gum and jaw bone -Nerves, blood vessels and the adjacent teeth need to be taken into consideration during the procedure Are all wisdom tooth extractions difficult? No, in general: -Lower wisdom tooth removal is more difficult than upper wisdom tooth removal -Difficulty increases with the degree of impaction -Difficulty increases if the tooth is grossly decayed -Difficulty increases with age (the ideal time for removal is in the 20s & 30s)  How are wisdom teeth removed? Most lower wisdom teeth are “stuck” and can not be removed like other teeth (this is why you were referred to an oral surgeon). Generally, we need to make a cut in the gum, expose the jaw bone in that area and use a drill to free up the tooth and remove it. Will I feel pain? -No, we will ensure that your mouth is fully numb using local anaesthesia- you will feel pinches in your mouth. -You will not feel the cut in your mouth. -You will feel some pushing and pressure, this is not pain and is unavoidable. -The drilling feels exactly like the sensation of having a filling and is not painful. -Stitches do not hurt. -We will advise/prescribe pain killers to make your recovery more comfortable. -If having sedation, you may not even remember the procedure. What is the recovery period? This depends on the degree of impaction, the number of teeth and your own particular healing! After the procedure, expect some soreness, swelling, bruising, bleeding & some limited mouth opening. This is usually well controlled with the prescribed pain medications. A full assessment of this can be made at your consultation. All patients receive a prescription and comprehensive written post-operative instructions following a surgical procedure. Sick certificates can be issued on request. Everyone has a small possibility of infection or dry socket following an extraction. The pre and post operative instructions aim to reduce this risk. Will I have nerve damage? Altered sensation to the lip/chin & tongue is a rare but recognised complication of lower wisdom tooth removal. This is seen in a fraction of a percent of patients. Each individual’s risk can only be assessed following a consultation with an oral surgeon. By having your wisdom teeth removed by an experienced specialist oral surgeon you can minimise (but not eliminate) this risk.               © Dublin Specialist Dentistry.

Wisdom teeth — the third molars in the very back of your mouth — may not need to be removed if they are:   Healthy  Grown in completely (fully erupted)  Positioned correctly and biting properly with their opposing teeth  Able to be cleaned as part of daily hygiene practices   Many times, however, wisdom teeth don't have room to grow properly and can cause problems. Erupting wisdom teeth can grow at various angles in the jaw, sometimes even horizontally. Problems can include wisdom teeth that:   Remain completely hidden within the gums. If they aren't able to emerge normally, wisdom teeth become trapped (impacted) within your jaw. Sometimes this can result in infection or can cause a cyst that can damage other teeth roots or bone support.  Emerge partially through the gums. Because this area is hard to see and clean, wisdom teeth that partially emerge create a passageway that can become a magnet for bacteria that cause gum disease and oral infection.  Crowd nearby teeth. If wisdom teeth don't have enough room to come in properly, they may crowd or damage nearby teeth.   Some dentists recommend removing wisdom teeth if they don't fully emerge. Many dentists believe it's better to remove wisdom teeth at a younger age, before the roots and bone are fully formed, and when recovery is generally faster after surgery. This is why some young adults have their wisdom teeth pulled before the teeth cause problems.  According to the American Dental Association, wisdom teeth removal may be necessary if you experience changes in the area of those teeth, such as:   Pain  Repeated infection of soft tissue behind the lower last tooth  Fluid-filled sacs (cysts)  Tumors  Damage to nearby teeth  Gum disease  Extensive tooth decay   The decision to remove wisdom teeth isn't always clear. Talk to your dentist or an oral surgeon about the position and health of your wisdom teeth and what's best for your situation.    With  Thomas J. Salinas, D.D.S.

See more personal hygiene pictures .  Stock4B/ Getty Images       If you're ever stuck at a party with nothing to talk about, you might mention that you're having your wisdom teeth taken out. The very mention of these teeth can start a war of words, as people duke it out to prove that their oral surgery was indeed the worst experience ever. The details of this rite of passage are ingrained in each person's mind, so you'll hear lots of gory information -- how one girl's face swelled as big as a watermelon, how another girl battled dry sockets, how one fellow had to miss Christmas dinner because the only thing he could eat was Jell-O . Debates will rage about the virtues of going under or staying awake during the surgery, and battle-scarred soldiers will compare how many teeth they had pulled. You can sit back and congratulate yourself for livening up this party.  Wisdom teeth are more formally known to dentists as third molars , while informally, they're known to oral surgeons as cash cows and to those of us who've had them removed, a source of surgical misery. These teeth were named for the time at which they make their appearance at the very back of the mouth, which is usually between the ages of 17 and 25, when a young person might be pursuing wisdom with higher education [source: Cooper ].            ­The third molars have the nasty habit of becoming impacted , or coming in at a funny angle or in an unexpected location. This poor positioning can cause pain and infection, and even if the teeth happen to come in correctly, there could still be trouble ahead. The third molars are difficult to clean , so they could rot and infect nearby teeth; they may also crowd adjacent teeth, undoing years of straight alignments created by braces. For these reasons, dentists usually recommend removing wisdom teeth in young adults, before the teeth have the chance to attach to the jaw and complicate extraction.  Though you may miss a few days of school or work for the surgery, you probably won't miss your wisdom teeth once they're gone, because we don't use them anymore. But if we don't need them, why do these teeth come in at all? Is it possible they may eventually disappear?                   1  2  3  4  NEXT       Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint      Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint                     More to Explore          Related Content          " "       Why are some animals harder to clone than others?

Some of the older readers of this article will read and may remember the days when they attempted to strike up a conversation with the opposite sex and casually ask: “Hey, babe! What’s your sign?” Basically meaning the date of your birth giving you the right to pry into their personal lives. Today, if you’re stuck at a boring party with nothing to talk about, you might mention that you’re planning to have your wisdom teeth taken out. On the other hand the very mention of those teeth could possibly start a war of words; ergo, proving that wisdom teeth oral surgery was indeed the worst experience of all time – except perhaps birth and a kidney stone. Wisdom Teeth AKA, Your Third Molar! This mutation regarding the formation of wisdom teeth dates back to around 300,000 to 450,000 years ago – yikes! This breaks down to nearly 25 percent of Americans with European ancestry, 12 percent of Americans with African ancestry and over 40 percent of Americans with Asian ancestry. And strangely enough, Asians do not have wisdom teeth to contend with. That said, it works this way, folks on the possibility that evolvement does, in fact, have something to do with that conundrum and here’s why! There is an “overlap” between the jaw size and brain size. As the jaw sizes shrank, your brain size was able to grow exponentially. The theory being that all of us had a mutation in the “genes” which control the jaw size reducing the jaw’s ability to grow larger and stronger. This allowed increased space for the size of your head to grow since it was not impeded by bulky jaw bone muscles. Highly Evolved? Could The Answer Be In Your Wrist? Your third molars seem to have a nasty habit of becoming “impacted.” To make that statement more clearly, adapting a weird angle or location in your mouth. This can present the opportunity for pain and infection. Sitting way back in your mouth they are many times hard to clean properly. So the question before the house of common sense is: “Do we really need wisdom teeth?” “Why do they come in at all?” “Is it possible they may eventually disappear altogether?” If you like tests, in a recent test at a college in the Midwest, a group of medical friends were asked to put their wrists out to see who was more “highly evolved.” The story goes that man who is currently evolving should have one “one” tendon on the wrist, not two. Truth or Fiction? Of course no person can predict evolutionary changes since evolution doesn’t have a goal. However, here are some educated trends: Humans of the future may have less hair. Future humans may be more resistant to heart disease and diabetes. Future humans may be physically weaker. If you have wisdom teeth, sorry that they were impacted. For those of you who don’t have them, either you’re “highly evolved” or just a lucky duck!      Taheri Dental    2017-11-06T14:19:49+00:00 Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!

Other Traits          Back to Other Traits           English   Español       I was born without wisdom teeth and my father was as well. My mother, brother, and sister all had them removed. Have my dad and I evolved or would this just be considered a genetic mutation?       -A curious adult from Oregon  June 08, 2007  One full week of my life, plus a month or two of misery. That is what wisdom teeth taught me!  All I can remember from the week after I got my wisdom teeth out was that my friend brought me all the movies she had in her house and a gallon of ice cream. My favorite was peach ice cream and Cinderella, but let's keep that our little secret.  As far as I can tell, if you don't have wisdom teeth, you are one of the lucky ones! We don't really know if growing wisdom teeth is stopped by mutation or even if not growing them has to do with DNA at all. This makes it hard to know for sure if you're a mutant, evolving, a result of your environment or some combination of the three.  So what would it take for not having wisdom teeth growing in to be a part of evolution? Evolution requires at least three things:  1) That there be two different traits 2) That the traits be due to DNA differences 3) That the trait increases in the population over time  We have the first one nailed for sure. You and your dad did not have wisdom teeth that grew in. Your mom's and your siblings' wisdom teeth did grow in.  The second one is a little iffier though. Some scientists think that not developing wisdom teeth is genetic, but others are not so sure. They think that not eating right or brushing your teeth well could be to blame.  This matters because the only traits we can pass on are the ones that are because of our DNA. For example, there are folks in Thailand who put rings around their necks to stretch them out. This stretching leads to very long necks. But their kids have unstretched necks because stretching doesn't affect the DNA they pass to their kids.  So to be a part of evolution, you and your dad need to not have wisdom teeth because of your DNA. But like I said, even this isn't enough.  For this DNA difference to be a part of evolution, not having wisdom teeth has to become more common in the population. Otherwise it is just an interesting DNA variation*.  So how might it become more common? One way is if not having wisdom teeth is an advantage somehow. In other words, you are more successful than your siblings because you didn't grow any wisdom teeth.  In population biology, more successful means that you have more kids who go on to survive and have more kids. Over time, not having wisdom teeth would become more common.  Let's take a fun example to make all of this clearer. I love the X-men movies, and they are good examples of DNA change and evolution. X-men are people who had a mutation in their DNA that gives them superpowers. One of the X-men is named Wolverine.  Now Wolverine heals very fast, and is super strong. This would be a really good mutation to have. You can imagine that if Wolverine had children that were very strong and could heal from any injury, they would be more likely to survive than normal people.  Over time, these folks would keep doing better. Until eventually more and more people would be like Wolverine. (Hopefully without the emotional baggage!)  Is not having wisdom teeth the same thing? That is hard to say, since wisdom teeth don't make us stronger or live longer.  Now in our past, you and your dad would certainly have been at a disadvantage. Back then people had to hunt and gather all day, and usually ended up eating grass and roots. Wisdom teeth helped us chew those awful, tough roots.  But since our food is soft and easy to eat, we don't need big mouths full of lots of strong teeth like our ancestors did. So, in evolution, our mouths have gotten smaller. Small mouths mean there is less room for teeth, so our wisdom teeth don't fit in our mouths anymore.  Wisdom teeth are no longer an advantage. So you and your dad won't be selected against. But another way for them to be part of evolution is if they are now a disadvantage. Then you and your dad would be at an advantage by not having them.  It is our modern world with its abundance of soft and easy food that has made our wisdom teeth of little use. And modern dentistry has made having them no big deal either.  It is hard to imagine that you will do significantly better than your brother or sister just because you were born without wisdom teeth. Now if a plague wipes out all the dentists tomorrow, it might be a different story. But that doesn't seem too likely.  Of course, there are other ways for a trait to become more common. Imagine you are stranded on a deserted island with only one other person. The two of you have kids and found a new population. Because of you, this new population will be less likely to have wisdom teeth.  Not because of some advantage. But because of luck, one of the founding members just happened to not have wisdom teeth. This is called the founder effect.  So there you have it. If your lack of wisdom teeth is genetic, then you can pass it on to your kids. And if your descendants form a larger percentage of a future population, then your lack of wisdom teeth could be a part of human evolution. Two big ifs at this point.  * If a DNA change is recent, it is called a mutation. If it is older, then it is variation. The older variation came from a mutation from long ago .

Credit: Carlos Caetano | Shutterstock     BOSTON — Many people have suffered from impacted third molars, also known as wisdom teeth. But there are also a lucky few who are missing a wisdom tooth or two (or even all four). Why do some people have wisdom teeth, while others don't?  The answer, partly hinted at in new research presented here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , could also explain why particular ethnic groups, such as the Inuit, have a particularly low occurrence of wisdom teeth.  Some thousands of years ago, a random mutation arose which suppressed the formation of wisdom teeth, a trait that then spread and now accounts for the lack of wisdom teeth among some modern humans, said Princeton University researcher Alan Mann.  The oldest fossils missing third molars hail from China and are about 300,000 to 400,000 years old, suggesting the first mutation may have arisen there, Mann told LiveScience.  Like most mammals, humans' ancestors had four sets of three molars (for a total of 12, with six in both the upper and lower jaw) used to help chew and grind food. Unlike other mammals, however, humans underwent a period of evolution in which the brain greatly expanded in size , Mann said. This created an architectural problem; with a much larger brain case, the jaw had to become narrower so that it could still connect to the lower part of the skull, Mann said.  Genes that control the quantity of teeth, however, evolve independently from those that control brain development, Mann's research has shown. This led to a mismatch, in which the human jaw was no longer large enough, in many cases, to give wisdom teeth room to erupt through the gums.  Impacted third molars (teeth that do not make it out of the gums) can become infected, leading to serious health problems. Even more commonly, however, wisdom teeth cause severe pain . This fact alone could help explain how the lack of wisdom teeth evolved, Mann said: The pain could make one less likely to reproduce. That would favor people with the mutation, who would suffer less pain, he added. [ Top 10 Useless Limbs (and Other Vestigial Organs) ]  "Imagine a scenario where one evening a person is in serious pain from an impacted third molar," Mann said. "Their partner comes up and says, 'How about a bout of reproduction?' And the person says, 'Not tonight, dear, my jaws are killing me.'"  Perhaps 10 to 25 percent of Americans of European ancestry are missing at least one third molar, Mann said. For African Americans and Asian Americans, the figure is 11 percent and 40 percent, respectively, he said. But the Inuit, a group of people who live in the Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland and Alaska, have the fewest wisdom teeth ; about 45 percent of them lack one or more third molar, he said.  There are probably a couple reasons for this. For one, this group originated in Asia, where the oldest fossils lacking wisdom teeth were found, Mann said. Secondly, like other Asians, the Inuit tend to have flatter faces (when compared to Europeans and Africans), meaning they have even narrower jaws, leaving less room for teeth, he said. Third, Inuit teeth also tend to be larger than average, meaning that this mutation would be even more advantageous in this population, Mann said.   Reach Douglas Main at dmain@techmedianetwork.com .

Menu Requires Javascript            Wisdom FAQ   What are wisdom teeth? Wisdom teeth (or third molars) are the last teeth to erupt into the mouth and are the furthest teeth from the front of the mouth. At what age do wisdom teeth erupt? Wisdom teeth usually erupt between the ages of 18-21 but this can vary between patients Does everyone have wisdom teeth? No, some people have all four wisdom teeth, some have one, two or three and some even have none. Do wisdom teeth always cause problems and need removal? No, in many cases, wisdom teeth erupt fully into the mouth into full function and behave exactly like any other tooth. Where a wisdom tooth remains fully buried, often it can be left alone if it is expected not to cause any problems. Diseased or potentially problematic wisdom teeth should be removed. What are the reasons for wisdom tooth removal? -Infection around a partially erupted wisdom tooth -Unrestorable decay or badly broken down tooth -Decay of the adjacent tooth caused by the wisdom tooth -Cyst formation etc -For orthodontic or prosthetic reasons  Why are wisdom teeth more difficult to remove than other teeth? This is because of a number of factors; -The jaw bone in this area is particularly dense -The roots of wisdom teeth can be multiple and at unfavourable angulations -The wisdom tooth is often partially covered by gum and jaw bone -Nerves, blood vessels and the adjacent teeth need to be taken into consideration during the procedure Are all wisdom tooth extractions difficult? No, in general: -Lower wisdom tooth removal is more difficult than upper wisdom tooth removal -Difficulty increases with the degree of impaction -Difficulty increases if the tooth is grossly decayed -Difficulty increases with age (the ideal time for removal is in the 20s & 30s)  How are wisdom teeth removed? Most lower wisdom teeth are “stuck” and can not be removed like other teeth (this is why you were referred to an oral surgeon). Generally, we need to make a cut in the gum, expose the jaw bone in that area and use a drill to free up the tooth and remove it. Will I feel pain? -No, we will ensure that your mouth is fully numb using local anaesthesia- you will feel pinches in your mouth. -You will not feel the cut in your mouth. -You will feel some pushing and pressure, this is not pain and is unavoidable. -The drilling feels exactly like the sensation of having a filling and is not painful. -Stitches do not hurt. -We will advise/prescribe pain killers to make your recovery more comfortable. -If having sedation, you may not even remember the procedure. What is the recovery period? This depends on the degree of impaction, the number of teeth and your own particular healing! After the procedure, expect some soreness, swelling, bruising, bleeding & some limited mouth opening. This is usually well controlled with the prescribed pain medications. A full assessment of this can be made at your consultation. All patients receive a prescription and comprehensive written post-operative instructions following a surgical procedure. Sick certificates can be issued on request. Everyone has a small possibility of infection or dry socket following an extraction. The pre and post operative instructions aim to reduce this risk. Will I have nerve damage? Altered sensation to the lip/chin & tongue is a rare but recognised complication of lower wisdom tooth removal. This is seen in a fraction of a percent of patients. Each individual’s risk can only be assessed following a consultation with an oral surgeon. By having your wisdom teeth removed by an experienced specialist oral surgeon you can minimise (but not eliminate) this risk.               © Dublin Specialist Dentistry.

Wisdom teeth — the third molars in the very back of your mouth — may not need to be removed if they are:   Healthy  Grown in completely (fully erupted)  Positioned correctly and biting properly with their opposing teeth  Able to be cleaned as part of daily hygiene practices   Many times, however, wisdom teeth don't have room to grow properly and can cause problems. Erupting wisdom teeth can grow at various angles in the jaw, sometimes even horizontally. Problems can include wisdom teeth that:   Remain completely hidden within the gums. If they aren't able to emerge normally, wisdom teeth become trapped (impacted) within your jaw. Sometimes this can result in infection or can cause a cyst that can damage other teeth roots or bone support.  Emerge partially through the gums. Because this area is hard to see and clean, wisdom teeth that partially emerge create a passageway that can become a magnet for bacteria that cause gum disease and oral infection.  Crowd nearby teeth. If wisdom teeth don't have enough room to come in properly, they may crowd or damage nearby teeth.   Some dentists recommend removing wisdom teeth if they don't fully emerge. Many dentists believe it's better to remove wisdom teeth at a younger age, before the roots and bone are fully formed, and when recovery is generally faster after surgery. This is why some young adults have their wisdom teeth pulled before the teeth cause problems.  According to the American Dental Association, wisdom teeth removal may be necessary if you experience changes in the area of those teeth, such as:   Pain  Repeated infection of soft tissue behind the lower last tooth  Fluid-filled sacs (cysts)  Tumors  Damage to nearby teeth  Gum disease  Extensive tooth decay   The decision to remove wisdom teeth isn't always clear. Talk to your dentist or an oral surgeon about the position and health of your wisdom teeth and what's best for your situation.    With  Thomas J. Salinas, D.D.S.

See more personal hygiene pictures .  Stock4B/ Getty Images       If you're ever stuck at a party with nothing to talk about, you might mention that you're having your wisdom teeth taken out. The very mention of these teeth can start a war of words, as people duke it out to prove that their oral surgery was indeed the worst experience ever. The details of this rite of passage are ingrained in each person's mind, so you'll hear lots of gory information -- how one girl's face swelled as big as a watermelon, how another girl battled dry sockets, how one fellow had to miss Christmas dinner because the only thing he could eat was Jell-O . Debates will rage about the virtues of going under or staying awake during the surgery, and battle-scarred soldiers will compare how many teeth they had pulled. You can sit back and congratulate yourself for livening up this party.  Wisdom teeth are more formally known to dentists as third molars , while informally, they're known to oral surgeons as cash cows and to those of us who've had them removed, a source of surgical misery. These teeth were named for the time at which they make their appearance at the very back of the mouth, which is usually between the ages of 17 and 25, when a young person might be pursuing wisdom with higher education [source: Cooper ].            ­The third molars have the nasty habit of becoming impacted , or coming in at a funny angle or in an unexpected location. This poor positioning can cause pain and infection, and even if the teeth happen to come in correctly, there could still be trouble ahead. The third molars are difficult to clean , so they could rot and infect nearby teeth; they may also crowd adjacent teeth, undoing years of straight alignments created by braces. For these reasons, dentists usually recommend removing wisdom teeth in young adults, before the teeth have the chance to attach to the jaw and complicate extraction.  Though you may miss a few days of school or work for the surgery, you probably won't miss your wisdom teeth once they're gone, because we don't use them anymore. But if we don't need them, why do these teeth come in at all? Is it possible they may eventually disappear?                   1  2  3  4  NEXT       Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint      Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint                     More to Explore          Related Content          " "       Why are some animals harder to clone than others?

Some of the older readers of this article will read and may remember the days when they attempted to strike up a conversation with the opposite sex and casually ask: “Hey, babe! What’s your sign?” Basically meaning the date of your birth giving you the right to pry into their personal lives. Today, if you’re stuck at a boring party with nothing to talk about, you might mention that you’re planning to have your wisdom teeth taken out. On the other hand the very mention of those teeth could possibly start a war of words; ergo, proving that wisdom teeth oral surgery was indeed the worst experience of all time – except perhaps birth and a kidney stone. Wisdom Teeth AKA, Your Third Molar! This mutation regarding the formation of wisdom teeth dates back to around 300,000 to 450,000 years ago – yikes! This breaks down to nearly 25 percent of Americans with European ancestry, 12 percent of Americans with African ancestry and over 40 percent of Americans with Asian ancestry. And strangely enough, Asians do not have wisdom teeth to contend with. That said, it works this way, folks on the possibility that evolvement does, in fact, have something to do with that conundrum and here’s why! There is an “overlap” between the jaw size and brain size. As the jaw sizes shrank, your brain size was able to grow exponentially. The theory being that all of us had a mutation in the “genes” which control the jaw size reducing the jaw’s ability to grow larger and stronger. This allowed increased space for the size of your head to grow since it was not impeded by bulky jaw bone muscles. Highly Evolved? Could The Answer Be In Your Wrist? Your third molars seem to have a nasty habit of becoming “impacted.” To make that statement more clearly, adapting a weird angle or location in your mouth. This can present the opportunity for pain and infection. Sitting way back in your mouth they are many times hard to clean properly. So the question before the house of common sense is: “Do we really need wisdom teeth?” “Why do they come in at all?” “Is it possible they may eventually disappear altogether?” If you like tests, in a recent test at a college in the Midwest, a group of medical friends were asked to put their wrists out to see who was more “highly evolved.” The story goes that man who is currently evolving should have one “one” tendon on the wrist, not two. Truth or Fiction? Of course no person can predict evolutionary changes since evolution doesn’t have a goal. However, here are some educated trends: Humans of the future may have less hair. Future humans may be more resistant to heart disease and diabetes. Future humans may be physically weaker. If you have wisdom teeth, sorry that they were impacted. For those of you who don’t have them, either you’re “highly evolved” or just a lucky duck!      Taheri Dental    2017-11-06T14:19:49+00:00 Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!

Other Traits          Back to Other Traits           English   Español       I was born without wisdom teeth and my father was as well. My mother, brother, and sister all had them removed. Have my dad and I evolved or would this just be considered a genetic mutation?       -A curious adult from Oregon  June 08, 2007  One full week of my life, plus a month or two of misery. That is what wisdom teeth taught me!  All I can remember from the week after I got my wisdom teeth out was that my friend brought me all the movies she had in her house and a gallon of ice cream. My favorite was peach ice cream and Cinderella, but let's keep that our little secret.  As far as I can tell, if you don't have wisdom teeth, you are one of the lucky ones! We don't really know if growing wisdom teeth is stopped by mutation or even if not growing them has to do with DNA at all. This makes it hard to know for sure if you're a mutant, evolving, a result of your environment or some combination of the three.  So what would it take for not having wisdom teeth growing in to be a part of evolution? Evolution requires at least three things:  1) That there be two different traits 2) That the traits be due to DNA differences 3) That the trait increases in the population over time  We have the first one nailed for sure. You and your dad did not have wisdom teeth that grew in. Your mom's and your siblings' wisdom teeth did grow in.  The second one is a little iffier though. Some scientists think that not developing wisdom teeth is genetic, but others are not so sure. They think that not eating right or brushing your teeth well could be to blame.  This matters because the only traits we can pass on are the ones that are because of our DNA. For example, there are folks in Thailand who put rings around their necks to stretch them out. This stretching leads to very long necks. But their kids have unstretched necks because stretching doesn't affect the DNA they pass to their kids.  So to be a part of evolution, you and your dad need to not have wisdom teeth because of your DNA. But like I said, even this isn't enough.  For this DNA difference to be a part of evolution, not having wisdom teeth has to become more common in the population. Otherwise it is just an interesting DNA variation*.  So how might it become more common? One way is if not having wisdom teeth is an advantage somehow. In other words, you are more successful than your siblings because you didn't grow any wisdom teeth.  In population biology, more successful means that you have more kids who go on to survive and have more kids. Over time, not having wisdom teeth would become more common.  Let's take a fun example to make all of this clearer. I love the X-men movies, and they are good examples of DNA change and evolution. X-men are people who had a mutation in their DNA that gives them superpowers. One of the X-men is named Wolverine.  Now Wolverine heals very fast, and is super strong. This would be a really good mutation to have. You can imagine that if Wolverine had children that were very strong and could heal from any injury, they would be more likely to survive than normal people.  Over time, these folks would keep doing better. Until eventually more and more people would be like Wolverine. (Hopefully without the emotional baggage!)  Is not having wisdom teeth the same thing? That is hard to say, since wisdom teeth don't make us stronger or live longer.  Now in our past, you and your dad would certainly have been at a disadvantage. Back then people had to hunt and gather all day, and usually ended up eating grass and roots. Wisdom teeth helped us chew those awful, tough roots.  But since our food is soft and easy to eat, we don't need big mouths full of lots of strong teeth like our ancestors did. So, in evolution, our mouths have gotten smaller. Small mouths mean there is less room for teeth, so our wisdom teeth don't fit in our mouths anymore.  Wisdom teeth are no longer an advantage. So you and your dad won't be selected against. But another way for them to be part of evolution is if they are now a disadvantage. Then you and your dad would be at an advantage by not having them.  It is our modern world with its abundance of soft and easy food that has made our wisdom teeth of little use. And modern dentistry has made having them no big deal either.  It is hard to imagine that you will do significantly better than your brother or sister just because you were born without wisdom teeth. Now if a plague wipes out all the dentists tomorrow, it might be a different story. But that doesn't seem too likely.  Of course, there are other ways for a trait to become more common. Imagine you are stranded on a deserted island with only one other person. The two of you have kids and found a new population. Because of you, this new population will be less likely to have wisdom teeth.  Not because of some advantage. But because of luck, one of the founding members just happened to not have wisdom teeth. This is called the founder effect.  So there you have it. If your lack of wisdom teeth is genetic, then you can pass it on to your kids. And if your descendants form a larger percentage of a future population, then your lack of wisdom teeth could be a part of human evolution. Two big ifs at this point.  * If a DNA change is recent, it is called a mutation. If it is older, then it is variation. The older variation came from a mutation from long ago .
