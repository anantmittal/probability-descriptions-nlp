If you don't make the necessary monetary preparations for a long life, you could end up penniless and have to rely on family or the government safety net for support.  How long will you live?  Estimate your life expectancy -- change your life Experts warn of retirement crisis So how long might you live? This post follows up my last post , which discussed a recent report from the American Academy of Actuaries that addressed longevity risk -- the risk of living beyond your life expectancy.  The report, " Risky Business: Living Longer Without Income for Life ," contains estimates from the Social Security Administration tables of life expectancies for individuals currently age 65. According to the report, a man age 65 can expect to live a further 18.9 years on average; a 65-year-old woman can expect to be alive an additional 20.9 years. These life expectancies have increased by about five years since 1935, when the Social Security program was implemented (longer lifespans are one cause of Social Security's current financing issues).  But these life expectancies are just averages. What are the odds of beating the averages?  The "Risky Business" report shows that a 65-year-old man has about one in five odds of living to age 90 -- about six years longer than his life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman has almost one in three odds of living to age 90 -- four years longer than her life expectancy. And a 65-year-old couple has a 45 percent chance -- almost 50-50 -- that one of them will survive to age 90.  The Social Security tables represent the population at large, including people who smoke or work in unhealthy environments. How do the odds improve if you take care of your health? The report calculates the odds if you experience mortality rates -- the odds of dying in a year -- that are 75 percent of those on the Social Security's tables. These lower mortality rates can apply to you if you have above average education, a regular job, don't smoke, keep your weight at healthy levels, eat nutritious food and/or get regular exercise. If you die at these reduced mortality rates, you'll live longer than the population at large.  In this case, the odds are almost one in three that a 65-year-old man will live to age 90 and about one in eight that he'll live until age 95 -- 11 years beyond his life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman has 42 percent odds of living to age 90, and 21 percent odds (more than one in five) of living to age 95 -- nine years beyond her life expectancy.  The odds are 31 percent -- almost one in three -- that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to age 95. The odds are one in 10 -- 10 percent -- that one member of this couple will live to age 100.  But most people aren't financially prepared to live that long or deal with the uncertainty of their actual lifespan. Retirement planning would be easier if you knew exactly how long you'll live. So what can you do to protect yourself against the risk of living too long? Stay tuned for my next post.   © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Through the power of actuarial estimates, it is possible to figure out approximately how long you are likely to live. We made a set of charts, based on data from the Social Security Administration's cohort life tables , that show, given your gender and current age, the probability that you will reach some particular later age. Naturally, these are based on averages for a particular age group — health conditions and lifestyle choices like diet, exercise, and smoking can vastly alter one's life expectancy. Regardless, this is important information for anyone who has to think about things like retirement and estate planning. Here are the charts, in descending order by present age: If you are an 80 year old man, your long-term odds are not great. There is a 30% chance of making it to your 90th birthday, and only about 14 in 1,000 will see 100. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration 70 year olds have a somewhat better prognosis. Almost 2/3 of 70 year old men and almost 3/4 of 70 year old women will live at least another ten years, and over 1/5 of men will make it to 90, as will 1/3 of women. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration For 60 year olds, we see some of the benefits of modern medicine kicking in. The overwhelming majority of 60 year olds will live until at least 70, and majorities will get to at least 80. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Similarly, very few people who make it to 50 die before they turn 60. As we look at younger and younger cohorts, we see better and better long-term odds as well. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration For people turning 40, comfortable majorities will see 80, and one in twenty women who are currently 40 will be able to blow out 100 birthday candles someday. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Dying in your thirties is an extremely old-fashioned idea. Only 1.5% of thirty year old men, and just 0.9% of thirty year old women will die before their fortieth birthday. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration The late 21st century will have more than its fair share of elderly millenials. 60% of twenty year old men and 70% of twenty year old women will live to see the year 2074. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration One interesting aspect of this data is that the Social Security administration projects that the gap in longevity between men and women will continue into the future. Even among today's ten year olds, girls are likely to outlive boys. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Finally, children born today will live longer than any other generation. About 2/3 will live past 80, and 1/3 past 90. Almost one in ten girls born now will live past 100.

USA TODAY Planning for how long your nest egg needs to last is a difficult one. (Photo: Thinkstock) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE If you knew your date of death, retirement planning would be a breeze. Unfortunately — or maybe fortunately? — you don't.  And that can make planning for retirement extremely difficult. Does your nest egg need to last 20 years? 30 years? 40 years? And what about couples? How should couples go about planning for the likelihood that one spouse — usually the husband — predeceases the other? Well, if you’re like most people, you’re guessing at this, and guessing quite wrong. “Many people do not understand longevity well, and those people who plan often do not plan for long enough,” says Anna Rappaport, president of a retirement consulting firm bearing her name and chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks. Noel Abkemeier is the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force.  (Photo: Handout) Becoming familiar with current life-expectancy statistics is the first order of business. “There are two aspects to addressing longevity,” says Noel Abkemeier, the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force. “First, understanding it, and then planning an income that will last throughout life.” You may live much longer than you think. "There have been significant improvements in how long people survive in retirement, especially for wealthier Americans,” says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management. Consider: Someone born in 1950 was expected to live to age 68.2. By contrast, someone born in 2014 was expected to live to age 78.8, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . In other words, someone born today will need to fund an extra 10 years of retirement vs. someone born 66 years ago. What’s more, life expectancy for those alive at age 65 has also increased dramatically. In 1950, a 65-year-old male could expect to live another 12.8 years. In 2014, a 65-year-old male could expect to live on average of 18 more years. The same is true for women. In 1950, a 65-year-o woman could expect to live another 15 years. By 2014, a 65-year-old woman could expect to live another 20.5 years. USA TODAY 1 piece of financial advice that's kinda dumb The Actuaries Longevity Illustrator can give you a good sense of how long you might live. Another resource is the Living to 100 life expectancy calculator . Financial advisers are starting to change assumptions about how long clients will live to make sure they don't outlive savings, according to a survey by InvestmentNews. Advisers are basing retirement-income plans on an average life span of 91 for men and 94 for women, according to the survey . “Many people do not understand longevity well,” says Anna Rappaport, chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks.  (Photo: Anna Rappaport Consulting) Consider the probabilities. One drawback with using life expectancy to plan for retirement is that it’s just an average. One-half will die before life expectancy, and the other half after. So, the better way to approach the problem is to consider the probability of living to certain ages. Consider: There’s a 25% chance that a 65-year-old man will live to 93; a 25% chance that a 65-year-old woman will live to 96; and for a couple 65 years old, there’s a 25% chance that the surviving spouse lives to 98, according to SOA projections. All that said, Blanchett still thinks it makes more sense for people (and planners) to use a fixed time horizon, such as planning to age 95. Couples should consider their combined planning timeline. For couples who are 65 today, there’s a 45% chance that a wife outlives her husband by five years and a 20% chance by 15 years, according to the SOA. “Don’t forget that assets need to last until the second to die for couples,” says Rappaport. Consider your genes and behavior. “Some factors that influence how long you live may be beyond your control,” according to the SOA. “Others depend upon the choices you make every day. A successful retirement plan will address both.” USA TODAY New retiree withdrawal rate: Goodbye 4%, hello age divided by 20 How will you manage longevity risk? There are some time-honored ways to deal with the risk of outliving your assets. Those include the use of annuities, a sound asset-drawdown plan, delaying Social Security to age 70 for the higher wage earner, and a reverse mortgage. Read Managing Post-Retirement Risks - A Guide to Retirement Planning . Remember, says Abkemeier, half of retirees will live longer (than life expectancy) and, to build in a cushion, individuals should plan for an additional five or more years when considering lifetime income.

Jun 23, 2015      More than three out of five 65-year-olds today will reach age 80.    Rising life expectancy and potentially exorbitant long-term care costs have increased the financial resources required to support oneself and one’s spouse in retirement and old age.  Americans today are living longer than did previous generations, thanks to advances in medicine and changes in lifestyle. As shown in the dark green bars, 50 years ago a man who had reached 65 had an 81 percent chance of reaching 70, a 41 percent chance of hitting 80, and a 10 percent chance of turning 90. By comparison, the chances of reaching those same ages for a man who reaches 65 in 2015 are (as shown in the light green bars) 90 percent, 62 percent, and 22 percent, respectively. Put differently, the likelihood of a 65-year-old man seeing his 80th birthday has increased by 50 percent, and the likelihood of him seeing his 90th birthday has more than doubled. Women live longer than men on average, and they have experienced smaller but still substantial gains in life expectancy over the past 50 years.

Saving for Retirement   Text size:   A  A  A       Plan for a long retirement       Comment E‑mail Share Print     Thanks to healthier lifestyles and breakthroughs in medical technology, life expectancy for Americans has increased significantly during the past half-century. While it's good news that you can expect to live longer in retirement and have a better quality of life, it also means your investment portfolio may need to last for 30 years or more.  For example, here's the likelihood of 65-year-olds living to certain ages, according to figures from the Society of Actuaries:   Male. A 65-year-old man has a 41% chance of living to age 85 and a 20% chance of living to age 90.  Female. A 65-year-old woman has a 53% chance of living to age 85 and a 32% chance of living to age 90.  Couple. If the man and woman are married, the chance that at least one of them will live to any given age is increased. There's a 72% chance that one of them will live to age 85 and a 45% chance that one will live to age 90. There's even an 18% chance that one of them will live to age 95, as shown below.   The following interactive example is designed to estimate the probability of living to a specific age.* You may enter your current age alone—or your and your spouse's current ages—and a number of years to see the chances of living that long.

Get the full data  More than a quarter of children aged 16 will see their 100th birthdays. Find out how likely you are to get there • Get the data         A girl born this year has a one-in-three chance of reaching their 100th birthday, while boys have a one-in-four chance, the Office for National Statistics figures show. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    We're all living longer . But how many of us will live to 100?  The Department for Work and Pensions have released a report detailing life expectancy in 2011 and comparing the generations at 20, 50 and 80 years old. The data sees 20-year-olds three times more likely to reach 100 than their grandparents, and twice as likely as their parents .  While a girl born in 2011 has a one-in-three chance of living to their 100th birthday, a boy has a one-in-four chance. However, compared to a baby born in 1931, the children of 2011 are almost eight times more likely to become centenarians.  The predictions by the Office for National Statistics estimate the likelihood of reaching 100 by looking either at your age now or the year of your birth. They show that by 2066, there will be more than half a million people in the UK aged 100 or over.  The phenomenon of Britain's ageing  population will impact on everything from pensions to the national health service. Pensions Minister Steve Webb says:   the dramatic speed at which life expectancy is changing means that we need to radically rethink our perceptions about our later lives … We simply can't look to our grandparents' experience of retirement as a model for our own. We will live longer and we will have to save more    Roll over line for numbers    So, what does it mean? Key figures from the data, show:   • The average chance of a 20-year-old to reach 100 is 23%; however women aged 20 have a 26.6% chance - heavily contrasting with the male 19.5% • Those aged 50 in 2011 have a 14.2% chance of seeing the year 2061 (17% of women, 11.4% of men) • A further ten years reduces your chances by 2.2%, and by the time they reach 70 the average Briton will be at 10.4% • Those aged 83-84 now have lowest likelihood of reaching 100 of any age group - 7.2%. Beyond this percentages begin to look up, with a 99-year-old having a 67.% chance of making it through to their 100th birthday   We've extracted the data from the DWP for you to play with.

The site, DeathRiskRankings.com , is the brainchild of researchers and students at Carnegie Mellon University. It provides answers based on publicly available data from the United States and Europe, comparing mortality risks by gender, age, cause of death and geographic region. Put your info in, and it produces the probable causes of your demise and provides insight on the timing of that unfortunate event.  The site can compare such things as the odds of death next year by breast cancer for, say, a 54-year-old Pennsylvania woman or her counterpart in the United Kingdom.  Of course the results produced by the web site speak to groups of people and cannot predict with accuracy when you might actually kick the bucket . The timing of your own end is based on many uncharted factors, from heredity to lifestyle to untimely accidents.  But noodling around with the interface can be enlightening, if not frightening.  "It turns out that the British woman has a 33 percent higher risk of breast cancer death. But for lung/throat cancer, the results are almost reversed, and the Pennsylvania woman has a 29 percent higher risk," explained Paul Fischbeck, site developer and professor of social and decision sciences and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.  "Most Americans don't have a particularly good understanding of their own mortality risks , let alone ranking of their relevant risks," said David Gerard, a former professor at Carnegie Mellon who is now an associate professor of economics at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.  The researchers found that beyond infancy, the risk of dying increases annually at an exponential rate.  A 20-year-old U.S. woman has a 1 in 2,000 (or 0.05 percent) chance of dying in the next year, for example. By age 40, the risk is three times greater; by age 60, it is 16 times greater; and by age 80, it is 100 times greater (around 1 in 20 or 5 percent).  "The risks are higher, but still not that bad," Gerard said. "At 80, the average U.S. woman still has a 95 percent chance of making it to her 81st birthday."  Other results for queries about dying within the year:  For every age group, men have a much higher annual death risk than women. For 20-year-olds, the risk is 2.5 to three times greater for men. Men are much more prone to accidents, homicides and suicides, and the risk of dying from heart disease is always higher for men than women, peaking in the 50s when men are 2.5 times at greater risk of dying.  Women's cancer risks are higher than men's in their 30s and 40s.  For heart disease and cancer, U.S. blacks have a much higher death risk than U.S. whites. Overall, blacks in their 30s and 40s are twice as likely to die within the year as their white counterparts. Only for suicides, do whites consistently exceed blacks, where whites typically have two to three times greater chances of dying.  For 20-year-old males, 80 percent of their death risks are from accidents, homicides and suicides. By age 50, however, these causes make up less than 10 percent and heart disease is No. 1, accounting for more than 30 percent of all deaths.   Obesity-related death risks are much higher in the United States than in Europe. For example, the annual diabetes death risk in the United States is three times that found in northern Europe for 60 year olds.  Fischbeck and Gerard hope the site will add information to the U.S. healtchcare debate .  "We believe that this tool, which allows anyone to assess their own risk of dying and to compare their risks with counterparts in the United States and Europe, could help inform the public and constructively engage them in the debate," Fischbeck said.

     during a relatively short period of time.  Here we present the 2014 period life table
     for the Social Security area population .
     For this table, the period life expectancy at a given age is the average remaining number 
	 of years expected prior to death for a person at that exact age, born on January 1, using the mortality 
	 rates for 2014 over the course of his or her remaining life.  This life table is available for certain prior years.

If you don't make the necessary monetary preparations for a long life, you could end up penniless and have to rely on family or the government safety net for support.  How long will you live?  Estimate your life expectancy -- change your life Experts warn of retirement crisis So how long might you live? This post follows up my last post , which discussed a recent report from the American Academy of Actuaries that addressed longevity risk -- the risk of living beyond your life expectancy.  The report, " Risky Business: Living Longer Without Income for Life ," contains estimates from the Social Security Administration tables of life expectancies for individuals currently age 65. According to the report, a man age 65 can expect to live a further 18.9 years on average; a 65-year-old woman can expect to be alive an additional 20.9 years. These life expectancies have increased by about five years since 1935, when the Social Security program was implemented (longer lifespans are one cause of Social Security's current financing issues).  But these life expectancies are just averages. What are the odds of beating the averages?  The "Risky Business" report shows that a 65-year-old man has about one in five odds of living to age 90 -- about six years longer than his life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman has almost one in three odds of living to age 90 -- four years longer than her life expectancy. And a 65-year-old couple has a 45 percent chance -- almost 50-50 -- that one of them will survive to age 90.  The Social Security tables represent the population at large, including people who smoke or work in unhealthy environments. How do the odds improve if you take care of your health? The report calculates the odds if you experience mortality rates -- the odds of dying in a year -- that are 75 percent of those on the Social Security's tables. These lower mortality rates can apply to you if you have above average education, a regular job, don't smoke, keep your weight at healthy levels, eat nutritious food and/or get regular exercise. If you die at these reduced mortality rates, you'll live longer than the population at large.  In this case, the odds are almost one in three that a 65-year-old man will live to age 90 and about one in eight that he'll live until age 95 -- 11 years beyond his life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman has 42 percent odds of living to age 90, and 21 percent odds (more than one in five) of living to age 95 -- nine years beyond her life expectancy.  The odds are 31 percent -- almost one in three -- that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to age 95. The odds are one in 10 -- 10 percent -- that one member of this couple will live to age 100.  But most people aren't financially prepared to live that long or deal with the uncertainty of their actual lifespan. Retirement planning would be easier if you knew exactly how long you'll live. So what can you do to protect yourself against the risk of living too long? Stay tuned for my next post.   © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Through the power of actuarial estimates, it is possible to figure out approximately how long you are likely to live. We made a set of charts, based on data from the Social Security Administration's cohort life tables , that show, given your gender and current age, the probability that you will reach some particular later age. Naturally, these are based on averages for a particular age group — health conditions and lifestyle choices like diet, exercise, and smoking can vastly alter one's life expectancy. Regardless, this is important information for anyone who has to think about things like retirement and estate planning. Here are the charts, in descending order by present age: If you are an 80 year old man, your long-term odds are not great. There is a 30% chance of making it to your 90th birthday, and only about 14 in 1,000 will see 100. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration 70 year olds have a somewhat better prognosis. Almost 2/3 of 70 year old men and almost 3/4 of 70 year old women will live at least another ten years, and over 1/5 of men will make it to 90, as will 1/3 of women. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration For 60 year olds, we see some of the benefits of modern medicine kicking in. The overwhelming majority of 60 year olds will live until at least 70, and majorities will get to at least 80. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Similarly, very few people who make it to 50 die before they turn 60. As we look at younger and younger cohorts, we see better and better long-term odds as well. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration For people turning 40, comfortable majorities will see 80, and one in twenty women who are currently 40 will be able to blow out 100 birthday candles someday. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Dying in your thirties is an extremely old-fashioned idea. Only 1.5% of thirty year old men, and just 0.9% of thirty year old women will die before their fortieth birthday. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration The late 21st century will have more than its fair share of elderly millenials. 60% of twenty year old men and 70% of twenty year old women will live to see the year 2074. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration One interesting aspect of this data is that the Social Security administration projects that the gap in longevity between men and women will continue into the future. Even among today's ten year olds, girls are likely to outlive boys. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Finally, children born today will live longer than any other generation. About 2/3 will live past 80, and 1/3 past 90. Almost one in ten girls born now will live past 100.

USA TODAY Planning for how long your nest egg needs to last is a difficult one. (Photo: Thinkstock) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE If you knew your date of death, retirement planning would be a breeze. Unfortunately — or maybe fortunately? — you don't.  And that can make planning for retirement extremely difficult. Does your nest egg need to last 20 years? 30 years? 40 years? And what about couples? How should couples go about planning for the likelihood that one spouse — usually the husband — predeceases the other? Well, if you’re like most people, you’re guessing at this, and guessing quite wrong. “Many people do not understand longevity well, and those people who plan often do not plan for long enough,” says Anna Rappaport, president of a retirement consulting firm bearing her name and chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks. Noel Abkemeier is the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force.  (Photo: Handout) Becoming familiar with current life-expectancy statistics is the first order of business. “There are two aspects to addressing longevity,” says Noel Abkemeier, the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force. “First, understanding it, and then planning an income that will last throughout life.” You may live much longer than you think. "There have been significant improvements in how long people survive in retirement, especially for wealthier Americans,” says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management. Consider: Someone born in 1950 was expected to live to age 68.2. By contrast, someone born in 2014 was expected to live to age 78.8, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . In other words, someone born today will need to fund an extra 10 years of retirement vs. someone born 66 years ago. What’s more, life expectancy for those alive at age 65 has also increased dramatically. In 1950, a 65-year-old male could expect to live another 12.8 years. In 2014, a 65-year-old male could expect to live on average of 18 more years. The same is true for women. In 1950, a 65-year-o woman could expect to live another 15 years. By 2014, a 65-year-old woman could expect to live another 20.5 years. USA TODAY 1 piece of financial advice that's kinda dumb The Actuaries Longevity Illustrator can give you a good sense of how long you might live. Another resource is the Living to 100 life expectancy calculator . Financial advisers are starting to change assumptions about how long clients will live to make sure they don't outlive savings, according to a survey by InvestmentNews. Advisers are basing retirement-income plans on an average life span of 91 for men and 94 for women, according to the survey . “Many people do not understand longevity well,” says Anna Rappaport, chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks.  (Photo: Anna Rappaport Consulting) Consider the probabilities. One drawback with using life expectancy to plan for retirement is that it’s just an average. One-half will die before life expectancy, and the other half after. So, the better way to approach the problem is to consider the probability of living to certain ages. Consider: There’s a 25% chance that a 65-year-old man will live to 93; a 25% chance that a 65-year-old woman will live to 96; and for a couple 65 years old, there’s a 25% chance that the surviving spouse lives to 98, according to SOA projections. All that said, Blanchett still thinks it makes more sense for people (and planners) to use a fixed time horizon, such as planning to age 95. Couples should consider their combined planning timeline. For couples who are 65 today, there’s a 45% chance that a wife outlives her husband by five years and a 20% chance by 15 years, according to the SOA. “Don’t forget that assets need to last until the second to die for couples,” says Rappaport. Consider your genes and behavior. “Some factors that influence how long you live may be beyond your control,” according to the SOA. “Others depend upon the choices you make every day. A successful retirement plan will address both.” USA TODAY New retiree withdrawal rate: Goodbye 4%, hello age divided by 20 How will you manage longevity risk? There are some time-honored ways to deal with the risk of outliving your assets. Those include the use of annuities, a sound asset-drawdown plan, delaying Social Security to age 70 for the higher wage earner, and a reverse mortgage. Read Managing Post-Retirement Risks - A Guide to Retirement Planning . Remember, says Abkemeier, half of retirees will live longer (than life expectancy) and, to build in a cushion, individuals should plan for an additional five or more years when considering lifetime income.

Jun 23, 2015      More than three out of five 65-year-olds today will reach age 80.    Rising life expectancy and potentially exorbitant long-term care costs have increased the financial resources required to support oneself and one’s spouse in retirement and old age.  Americans today are living longer than did previous generations, thanks to advances in medicine and changes in lifestyle. As shown in the dark green bars, 50 years ago a man who had reached 65 had an 81 percent chance of reaching 70, a 41 percent chance of hitting 80, and a 10 percent chance of turning 90. By comparison, the chances of reaching those same ages for a man who reaches 65 in 2015 are (as shown in the light green bars) 90 percent, 62 percent, and 22 percent, respectively. Put differently, the likelihood of a 65-year-old man seeing his 80th birthday has increased by 50 percent, and the likelihood of him seeing his 90th birthday has more than doubled. Women live longer than men on average, and they have experienced smaller but still substantial gains in life expectancy over the past 50 years.

Saving for Retirement   Text size:   A  A  A       Plan for a long retirement       Comment E‑mail Share Print     Thanks to healthier lifestyles and breakthroughs in medical technology, life expectancy for Americans has increased significantly during the past half-century. While it's good news that you can expect to live longer in retirement and have a better quality of life, it also means your investment portfolio may need to last for 30 years or more.  For example, here's the likelihood of 65-year-olds living to certain ages, according to figures from the Society of Actuaries:   Male. A 65-year-old man has a 41% chance of living to age 85 and a 20% chance of living to age 90.  Female. A 65-year-old woman has a 53% chance of living to age 85 and a 32% chance of living to age 90.  Couple. If the man and woman are married, the chance that at least one of them will live to any given age is increased. There's a 72% chance that one of them will live to age 85 and a 45% chance that one will live to age 90. There's even an 18% chance that one of them will live to age 95, as shown below.   The following interactive example is designed to estimate the probability of living to a specific age.* You may enter your current age alone—or your and your spouse's current ages—and a number of years to see the chances of living that long.

Get the full data  More than a quarter of children aged 16 will see their 100th birthdays. Find out how likely you are to get there • Get the data         A girl born this year has a one-in-three chance of reaching their 100th birthday, while boys have a one-in-four chance, the Office for National Statistics figures show. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    We're all living longer . But how many of us will live to 100?  The Department for Work and Pensions have released a report detailing life expectancy in 2011 and comparing the generations at 20, 50 and 80 years old. The data sees 20-year-olds three times more likely to reach 100 than their grandparents, and twice as likely as their parents .  While a girl born in 2011 has a one-in-three chance of living to their 100th birthday, a boy has a one-in-four chance. However, compared to a baby born in 1931, the children of 2011 are almost eight times more likely to become centenarians.  The predictions by the Office for National Statistics estimate the likelihood of reaching 100 by looking either at your age now or the year of your birth. They show that by 2066, there will be more than half a million people in the UK aged 100 or over.  The phenomenon of Britain's ageing  population will impact on everything from pensions to the national health service. Pensions Minister Steve Webb says:   the dramatic speed at which life expectancy is changing means that we need to radically rethink our perceptions about our later lives … We simply can't look to our grandparents' experience of retirement as a model for our own. We will live longer and we will have to save more    Roll over line for numbers    So, what does it mean? Key figures from the data, show:   • The average chance of a 20-year-old to reach 100 is 23%; however women aged 20 have a 26.6% chance - heavily contrasting with the male 19.5% • Those aged 50 in 2011 have a 14.2% chance of seeing the year 2061 (17% of women, 11.4% of men) • A further ten years reduces your chances by 2.2%, and by the time they reach 70 the average Briton will be at 10.4% • Those aged 83-84 now have lowest likelihood of reaching 100 of any age group - 7.2%. Beyond this percentages begin to look up, with a 99-year-old having a 67.% chance of making it through to their 100th birthday   We've extracted the data from the DWP for you to play with.

The site, DeathRiskRankings.com , is the brainchild of researchers and students at Carnegie Mellon University. It provides answers based on publicly available data from the United States and Europe, comparing mortality risks by gender, age, cause of death and geographic region. Put your info in, and it produces the probable causes of your demise and provides insight on the timing of that unfortunate event.  The site can compare such things as the odds of death next year by breast cancer for, say, a 54-year-old Pennsylvania woman or her counterpart in the United Kingdom.  Of course the results produced by the web site speak to groups of people and cannot predict with accuracy when you might actually kick the bucket . The timing of your own end is based on many uncharted factors, from heredity to lifestyle to untimely accidents.  But noodling around with the interface can be enlightening, if not frightening.  "It turns out that the British woman has a 33 percent higher risk of breast cancer death. But for lung/throat cancer, the results are almost reversed, and the Pennsylvania woman has a 29 percent higher risk," explained Paul Fischbeck, site developer and professor of social and decision sciences and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.  "Most Americans don't have a particularly good understanding of their own mortality risks , let alone ranking of their relevant risks," said David Gerard, a former professor at Carnegie Mellon who is now an associate professor of economics at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.  The researchers found that beyond infancy, the risk of dying increases annually at an exponential rate.  A 20-year-old U.S. woman has a 1 in 2,000 (or 0.05 percent) chance of dying in the next year, for example. By age 40, the risk is three times greater; by age 60, it is 16 times greater; and by age 80, it is 100 times greater (around 1 in 20 or 5 percent).  "The risks are higher, but still not that bad," Gerard said. "At 80, the average U.S. woman still has a 95 percent chance of making it to her 81st birthday."  Other results for queries about dying within the year:  For every age group, men have a much higher annual death risk than women. For 20-year-olds, the risk is 2.5 to three times greater for men. Men are much more prone to accidents, homicides and suicides, and the risk of dying from heart disease is always higher for men than women, peaking in the 50s when men are 2.5 times at greater risk of dying.  Women's cancer risks are higher than men's in their 30s and 40s.  For heart disease and cancer, U.S. blacks have a much higher death risk than U.S. whites. Overall, blacks in their 30s and 40s are twice as likely to die within the year as their white counterparts. Only for suicides, do whites consistently exceed blacks, where whites typically have two to three times greater chances of dying.  For 20-year-old males, 80 percent of their death risks are from accidents, homicides and suicides. By age 50, however, these causes make up less than 10 percent and heart disease is No. 1, accounting for more than 30 percent of all deaths.   Obesity-related death risks are much higher in the United States than in Europe. For example, the annual diabetes death risk in the United States is three times that found in northern Europe for 60 year olds.  Fischbeck and Gerard hope the site will add information to the U.S. healtchcare debate .  "We believe that this tool, which allows anyone to assess their own risk of dying and to compare their risks with counterparts in the United States and Europe, could help inform the public and constructively engage them in the debate," Fischbeck said.

     during a relatively short period of time.  Here we present the 2014 period life table
     for the Social Security area population .
     For this table, the period life expectancy at a given age is the average remaining number 
	 of years expected prior to death for a person at that exact age, born on January 1, using the mortality 
	 rates for 2014 over the course of his or her remaining life.  This life table is available for certain prior years.

Life Expectancy (LE) tables are based on actual mortality experience collected from sources such as the life insurance companies and the Social Security Administration. LE tables show the average probability of death by a certain age. The LE data provided is not necessarily indicative of life expectancy, and the insured may live longer than indicated by the table. The LE tables used are not tailored to a particular situation or risk class; rather, they are based on population averages and are presented to help form a generalized idea of potential ages at death.
