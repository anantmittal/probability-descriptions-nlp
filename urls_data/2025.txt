Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Question: "I've heard there are ways to boost the chances of making a baby boy — or girl. What are these gender selection techniques?" Do you have visions of pink…or blue in your future? Maybe you see yourself painting the nursery pastel pink and shopping for flowery dresses? Or perhaps you can’t wait to get your hands on a baby-blue layette and stock up on Tonka trucks? While having a healthy baby is most certainly your top priority, it’s also totally normal (and quite common) to yearn for a boy to add to your brood or pine for a girl to go gaga over. Whichever gender you have your heart set on, there are some ways — both scientific and silly — that may manipulate Mother Nature and increase your odds of conceiving a boy or a girl. Take a look at these gender selection options: Gender Selection the High Tech Way If you’re getting an assist from science to get pregnant in the first place, you may be able to have a hand in which gender you conceive. As promising and exciting as these high-tech boosts may sound, you’ll have to remember that these methods of gender selection are costly, invasive, sometimes controversial, and may require that you meet strict eligibility criteria. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): This method was developed to help couples who have gone through genetic testing and know they are carriers of serious gender-linked disorders (certain conditions are inherited by boys and not by girls, and vice versa). Used in conjunction with in-vitro fertilization (IVF), doctors extract one cell from the rapidly dividing embryo fertilized in the petri dish and examine it to determine gender. Only embryos of the desired sex will be implanted in the mom’s uterus. While this method is effective, it is also controversial — and most fertility centers and medical organizations discourage it if there is no real medical reason to select gender. Sperm sorting: This gender selection technique involves separating girl-producing sperm (X-sperm) from boy-producing sperm (Y-sperm) in the lab and then either inserting sperm of the desired gender into the mom-to-be’s uterus via intrauterine insemination (IUI) or using the chosen sperm to fertilize an egg in vitro. Gender Selection the Low Tech Way If you and your partner are conceiving the old-fashioned way (i.e., without a medical professional), there are less-expensive and less-invasive ways to try gender selection. But as you might imagine, these methods are also less effective — and have not been shown to be any more successful than just letting nature take its course. Still, there’s no harm in trying. The Shettles Method: The main theory behind this method of gender selection — which boasts a 75 percent success rate (though independent studies haven’t backed up that claim) — is that girl-producing sperm (X-sperm) move slower but are more resilient and live longer than male-producing sperm (Y-sperm), which are faster but have shorter life spans. So if you’re pining for a girl, you should have sex two to four days before you ovulate — that way the X-sperm will be the only sperm alive and waiting around in your fallopian tubes by the time your egg drops in a few days later. If you want a boy, on the other hand, you should have sex as close as possible to ovulation — since the speedy Y-sperm will be more likely to get to the egg first. There are other specifics to follow with the Shettles Method that may make the vaginal tract more inviting for either the X- or Y-sperm (like sexual positions and even whether or not the woman has an orgasm), and if you’re willing to give it a try, it certainly won’t lower your already 50-50 chances of conceiving the gender of your choice! The Whelan Method: The Whelan Method of gender selection is pretty much the opposite of the Shettles Method — that’s science for you! It’s based on the idea that biochemical changes in a woman’s body at certain times in her cycle make it more likely that Y-sperm will fertilize an egg, while other times in her cycle, her biochemistry will favor X-sperm. So to conceive a boy, you should have sex four to six days before ovulation. And to conceive a girl, you should have sex either two to three days before ovulation or on the day of ovulation. Critics of this method say that having sex four to six days before ovulation is way too far away from the release of the egg to even get pregnant, since sperm can’t survive that long. Gender-selection kits: There are a variety of kits available that are based on altering the conditions around the egg and sperm (by using nutritional supplements and douches) to make the vaginal tract more receptive to either the X- or Y-sperm. Most experts consider the claims of these kits to be suspect. Gender Selection the No Tech Way As you would imagine, old wives’ tales abound on how to conceive a boy or girl — a quick search on the Web will show you that! These methods of gender selection are based on some research, but be forewarned that they come with no guarantee. Some theories focus on nutrition. For instance, for a boy some research suggests that you indulge in red meat, potassium, and salty foods. For a girl, be sure your diet includes eggs, yogurt, and — yes — chocolate! Other methods focus on sexual positions. For example, to increase your odds of having a boy, make love standing up or doggy style, and be sure to climax first. And if you want a girl, try the missionary position and let your guy reach orgasm first. Hey, it may sound kooky, but you’ll certainly have fun! Happy baby making!

A male animal is not female. Male life forms are the opposite of females in many ways. The biggest way is that males can’t have babies.   Male is a manly word. Rarr! You won’t find women on an all-male rugby team. If the doctor says, “It’s a boy,” you’ve got yourself a male baby. Males exist in plants and other animals — the male is the gamete-producing sex that fertilizes the female. Things can be male, too, like adapters that have male parts that fit into female parts. Most male animals are bigger than females, but not all. The biggest blue whales are female.

The speculation is that this is nature’s way of countering the relatively high mortality rates of males, and creating more of a gender balance in the population. While historically, there have been about 105 boys born for every 100 girls worldwide — which creates a “sex ratio at birth” of 1.05 — the share of boy babies has increased in recent decades. 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 1.07, or 107 boys born for every 100 girls.  This increase in the sex ratio is driven largely by births in China, where sex ratios have declined slightly in recent years but remain the highest in the world. The world’s most populous country has 118 boys for every 100 girls, and accounts for 12% of births worldwide. However, disproportionately large shares of baby boys are found in other countries scattered throughout Asia and the Caucasus, as well. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, South Korea, and the Solomon Islands round out the list of places with the highest sex ratios. India is tied with Macedonia, Montenegro, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Serbia and Suriname for 7th place, with a ratio of 108 boys born for every 100 girls.  Even while some countries seem to have a disproportionate share of boys, others have particularly high shares of baby girls. While there are still slightly more boys born than girls in these places — which are centered in sub-Saharan Africa — the sex ratios are nonetheless much lower than average. The six countries with the lowest sex ratios include: Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, and Madagascar.  So what explains these differences in the shares of baby boys and girls?  Perhaps the best-known reason relates to the practice of sex-selective abortion , which has been identified in Asia, and in the Caucasus , as well. The ability to determine fetal sex, along with strong son preferences, accounts in large part for the high shares of boys in many countries in these regions. The desire to limit family size, either due to government regulations as in China, or due to global social and economic changes that have reduced the need for large families, seems to further contribute to sex-selective abortion and a dearth of baby girls.  But this is only one of myriad factors that may be affecting the sex ratio at birth. Some research suggests that the share of newborn boys declines with older parents , and that the high share of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa may be linked to the practice of polygamy (multiple wives). What do these two phenomena have in common? Researchers hypothesize that both situations are associated with less frequent intercourse . (For possible explanations of this association, see this article from the academic journal Human Reproduction .)  On the opposite end of the spectrum, most research shows that the share of baby boys increases during and after wartime . And once again, frequency of intercourse is cited as the likely reason, at least in the case of post-war reunions.  In some cases, though, wartime is associated with a higher share of girl babies. This may relate to the fact that heightened maternal stress , such as would occur during wartime, can lead to an increased likelihood of a miscarriage which is more likely to occur among male fetuses .  Further evidence of this association between maternal stress and the increased share of girl babies emerges from an analysis of births in the vicinity of the Kobe earthquake in Japan, which showed that the share of females born nine months after that event was significantly higher than would have been expected under normal circumstances.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

So don't wait until you ovulate. Use our handy dandy ovulation calculator to help you plan to do the deed two or more days before ovulation. Or you could try The Whelan Method , named after Elizabeth Whelan, author of Boy or Girl, which is basically the opposite approach.

If you have a family of all boys or all girls, it may be hard to believe that it's the result of only chance! Check out what statistics and data on a large number of families show us.  50/50 Odds  If there are roughly even odds of having a boy or a girl with each baby, given the laws of chance we should still expect to see some all same-gender families, even in large families.  Here is the number of all same-gender families we would expect to see, purely by 50/50 chance:   Family Size Same-Gender  Mixed-Gender  2 Children 50%   50%  3 Children 25% 75%  4 Children 12.5% 87.5%  5 Children 6%   94%  6 Children 3% 97%  7 Children 1.6% 98.4%   That's according to statistics! But does reality follow those odds? In a moment we'll compare the 50/50 odds with real population data for thousands of families to see if same-gender families actually occur more often than we'd expect just by chance; but first, let's talk about:  Are boys and girls like a coin toss?  My twins' math teacher introduced the class to probablilty by having the kids flip a penny, and count the number of heads/tails. In a class of 20 children, each child flipped the coin 3 times. Five children flipped all heads or all tails!   What happened???   As expected, with 50/50 odds,  3 flips should result in all heads or all tails about 25% of the time. (Just like the odds of having 3 same-gender children are 25% on the chart above.)  Or, the teacher gave loaded coins to 5 children!   I think we can assume the teacher didn't pass out loaded coins!  But when we see a family of three boys or three girls, many of us automatically assume that there's some force at work -- especially if we're the parents of those three brothers or sisters! -- rather than just natural 50/50 odds.  It's harder to grasp when it's a baby instead of a penny: because three is a very SMALL number statistically speaking, but when you're talking about a family, three can seem like a big number. But the odds don't change!  What about bigger families?  When you see a family of say, six boys or six girls, it certainly seems like some kind of statistical fluke!  But take a look at the chart above: there's a 3% chance of having all boys or all girls with 6 children.  This means that out of 100 families with 6 children, it's not only possible to have all boys or all girls by chance alone, but we would expect to see three families with all boys or all girls, given completely even chances for each child being a boy or a girl! So in fact, it's not a fluke: just like if you had 100 people flip a coin six times, about 3 of them would get all heads or all tails -- with an evenly weighted coin.

Real Families  Now, remembering that the boy/girl birth ratio is actually 51/49, not 50/50, let's take a look at how often same-gender families occur in a population sample of thousands of families .   2-Child Families  All Boys   25.8% Actual  25.0% Predicted  Boy/Girl   52.2% Actual  50.0% Predicted  All Girls   22.0% Actual  25.0% Predicted  3-Child Families  All Boys   14.9% Actual  12.5% Predicted  Boy/Girl   73.0% Actual  75.0% Predicted  All Girls   12.1% Actual  12.5% Predicted  4-Child Families  All Boys   9.1% Actual  6.3% Predicted  Boy/Girl   85.4%  87.4%  All Girls   5.5% Actual  6.3% Predicted   In each case, we seem to see slightly more boys than we'd expect from 50/50 chance, probably due to the fact that 2% more boys are actually born in the normal 51/49 birth sex ratio.  This means the most likely explanation for same-gender families is simple chance.  In fact, it's good evidence that nothing else causes families to have all boys or all girls: if there were, we would see too many same-gender families, because we'd have those that occurred by chance alone, plus those caused by some other factor.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!

What are the signs I'm having a baby girl?  Take our boy or girl quiz      Video Boy or girl? Watch how your baby develops into a boy or girl.  You're bound to be curious about your baby's gender , even if you're waiting until the birth to find out. But what if you could tell just by the season in which you conceived, or by what job your partner has? Folk tales are one thing, but what real-life factors may affect the gender of your baby?  What are the signs I'm having a baby boy? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a boy if:  You and your partner are living together  One large study of 86,000 parents showed that couples who were living together when they conceived were slightly more likely to have a boy (Norberg 2004) .  Just over half (51.5 per cent) of couples living together before conception had a boy, compared with 49.9 per cent of those who lived apart. But why domestic bliss results in more boys is not entirely clear.  You've been living together for less than a year  If your relationship is new and exciting, you'll probably be having lots of sex (Brewis and Meyer 2005) . Frequent sex gives male sperm a slightly bigger advantage than usual.  Male sperm are lighter, have smaller heads, and shorter tails (Jongbloet 2004) . They can swim more easily through the slightly less hospitable fertile mucus , which coincides with the beginning and the end of your fertile window . This includes the time of ovulation (Jongbloet 2004) .  Some experts think that female sperm are more likely to reach the egg in the middle of your fertile period (James 2008) .  By having frequent sex, you are more likely to have sex at the start and end of your fertile window, when male sperm have a slight advantage.  You're feeling stressed  Boys tend to be conceived at times of sustained stress , such as during and following a war (Helle et al 2009, Hohmann et al 2010) .  One theory is that the mum's high stress levels leads to increases in testosterone and cortisol (Grant 2007, Grant and Irwin 2009) . This may lead to changes in the egg, which make it easier for male sperm to penetrate.  Just how this happens isn't clear, but there is still so much we don't know about the exact moment of conception .  You have a higher calorie intake  One study divided 740 British women into groups according to their calorie intake (Mathews et al 2008) . Of the women who had the highest energy intake (about 2,413 calories), 56 per cent had boys. Of the women who had the lowest energy intake (about 2,283 calories), only 45 per cent had boys.  Boys are more fragile and are statistically less likely to be conceived, or to survive pregnancy, when food is short. Girl sperm are more robust, so in harder times they may be more able to survive.  But it's clear that, whether you're having a boy or a girl, a healthy diet is important both before you conceive and during pregnancy .  What are the signs I'm having a baby girl? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a girl if:  You're over 35 years old and the dad-to-be is over 40 years old  The older the mum and dad , the more likely the female sperm are to fertilise the egg (Matsuo et al 2009) . This could be due to hormonal influences in the woman as she ages. And in older dads , the female sperm is more likely to win the race. The quality of sperm deteriorates with age and older men produce fewer male sperm.  Or it could be because we tend to have sex less often (Brewis 2005) as we get older. Also, older couples may be more likely to have sex in the middle of the fertile period, when female sperm may have the edge over male sperm.  You suffer badly from pregnancy sickness  If you have severe pregnancy sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum), you're slightly more likely to have a baby girl.  A review of 13 studies found that 55 per cent of babies born to women who'd had severe pregnancy sickness were girls (Veenendaal et al 2011) . This was compared with 49 per cent in the control group of women who didn't suffer from it. Some experts think that this is due to high levels of the hormone oestrogen, which is linked with pregnancy sickness .  You were born in a tropical climate and conceived there  Fancy a long holiday, somewhere warm?  It's not clear how much time you and your partner would need to spend in a tropical climate for there to be any effect, or if you would need to have been born there, too. But a global survey of birth data showed that more girls are born in the tropics (the region around the equator) than anywhere else in the world (Navara 2009) .  One theory is that the hormone melatonin has an effect. Melatonin causes changes in the reproductive systems of animals in response to the length of the day. More females are born when the days are longer. Or it could be that a high temperature alters the survival of male or female sperm in semen.  Your baby was conceived in the winter  However, in some countries, more girls are conceived in winter, and more boys are conceived in the summer (Cagnacci et al 2003, Melnikov and Grech 2003) . Farmers have noticed this effect in their animals for many years.  This may be because more viral and bacterial infections are around in the winter. As male sperm and embryos are more fragile, girls may be more able to withstand mums catching infections than boys.  Dad-to-be's job involves pollutants or stress  A few studies have looked at the dad's occupation and the ratio of boys and girls born to them. They found that jobs that involve stress or pollutants seem to result in more girls.  Though they were small-scale studies, which only looked at certain occupations, dads with the following jobs resulted in more girls than average:   professional driver (James 2008) deep-sea diver (James 2008) submarine sonar technician (Volk 2004) flour mill worker (Milham and Ossiander 2008) high-performance pilot (James 2008)  You conceived after having your ovulation induced hormonally  Some studies carried out among women who used hormones to induce ovulation, such as clomifene , show that you are slightly more likely to have a girl if artificial hormones are involved (James 2008) . However, other experts aren't convinced.  You already have two or more children  It's possible that the more children you have, the more likely you are to have a girl. This may be due to the fact that the more pregnancies you have, the higher your levels of the hormone gonadotrophin (James 1980) . Some experts have claimed that these higher hormonal levels could be linked to a higher chance of having a girl.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Question: "I've heard there are ways to boost the chances of making a baby boy — or girl. What are these gender selection techniques?" Do you have visions of pink…or blue in your future? Maybe you see yourself painting the nursery pastel pink and shopping for flowery dresses? Or perhaps you can’t wait to get your hands on a baby-blue layette and stock up on Tonka trucks? While having a healthy baby is most certainly your top priority, it’s also totally normal (and quite common) to yearn for a boy to add to your brood or pine for a girl to go gaga over. Whichever gender you have your heart set on, there are some ways — both scientific and silly — that may manipulate Mother Nature and increase your odds of conceiving a boy or a girl. Take a look at these gender selection options: Gender Selection the High Tech Way If you’re getting an assist from science to get pregnant in the first place, you may be able to have a hand in which gender you conceive. As promising and exciting as these high-tech boosts may sound, you’ll have to remember that these methods of gender selection are costly, invasive, sometimes controversial, and may require that you meet strict eligibility criteria. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): This method was developed to help couples who have gone through genetic testing and know they are carriers of serious gender-linked disorders (certain conditions are inherited by boys and not by girls, and vice versa). Used in conjunction with in-vitro fertilization (IVF), doctors extract one cell from the rapidly dividing embryo fertilized in the petri dish and examine it to determine gender. Only embryos of the desired sex will be implanted in the mom’s uterus. While this method is effective, it is also controversial — and most fertility centers and medical organizations discourage it if there is no real medical reason to select gender. Sperm sorting: This gender selection technique involves separating girl-producing sperm (X-sperm) from boy-producing sperm (Y-sperm) in the lab and then either inserting sperm of the desired gender into the mom-to-be’s uterus via intrauterine insemination (IUI) or using the chosen sperm to fertilize an egg in vitro. Gender Selection the Low Tech Way If you and your partner are conceiving the old-fashioned way (i.e., without a medical professional), there are less-expensive and less-invasive ways to try gender selection. But as you might imagine, these methods are also less effective — and have not been shown to be any more successful than just letting nature take its course. Still, there’s no harm in trying. The Shettles Method: The main theory behind this method of gender selection — which boasts a 75 percent success rate (though independent studies haven’t backed up that claim) — is that girl-producing sperm (X-sperm) move slower but are more resilient and live longer than male-producing sperm (Y-sperm), which are faster but have shorter life spans. So if you’re pining for a girl, you should have sex two to four days before you ovulate — that way the X-sperm will be the only sperm alive and waiting around in your fallopian tubes by the time your egg drops in a few days later. If you want a boy, on the other hand, you should have sex as close as possible to ovulation — since the speedy Y-sperm will be more likely to get to the egg first. There are other specifics to follow with the Shettles Method that may make the vaginal tract more inviting for either the X- or Y-sperm (like sexual positions and even whether or not the woman has an orgasm), and if you’re willing to give it a try, it certainly won’t lower your already 50-50 chances of conceiving the gender of your choice! The Whelan Method: The Whelan Method of gender selection is pretty much the opposite of the Shettles Method — that’s science for you! It’s based on the idea that biochemical changes in a woman’s body at certain times in her cycle make it more likely that Y-sperm will fertilize an egg, while other times in her cycle, her biochemistry will favor X-sperm. So to conceive a boy, you should have sex four to six days before ovulation. And to conceive a girl, you should have sex either two to three days before ovulation or on the day of ovulation. Critics of this method say that having sex four to six days before ovulation is way too far away from the release of the egg to even get pregnant, since sperm can’t survive that long. Gender-selection kits: There are a variety of kits available that are based on altering the conditions around the egg and sperm (by using nutritional supplements and douches) to make the vaginal tract more receptive to either the X- or Y-sperm. Most experts consider the claims of these kits to be suspect. Gender Selection the No Tech Way As you would imagine, old wives’ tales abound on how to conceive a boy or girl — a quick search on the Web will show you that! These methods of gender selection are based on some research, but be forewarned that they come with no guarantee. Some theories focus on nutrition. For instance, for a boy some research suggests that you indulge in red meat, potassium, and salty foods. For a girl, be sure your diet includes eggs, yogurt, and — yes — chocolate! Other methods focus on sexual positions. For example, to increase your odds of having a boy, make love standing up or doggy style, and be sure to climax first. And if you want a girl, try the missionary position and let your guy reach orgasm first. Hey, it may sound kooky, but you’ll certainly have fun! Happy baby making!

A male animal is not female. Male life forms are the opposite of females in many ways. The biggest way is that males can’t have babies.   Male is a manly word. Rarr! You won’t find women on an all-male rugby team. If the doctor says, “It’s a boy,” you’ve got yourself a male baby. Males exist in plants and other animals — the male is the gamete-producing sex that fertilizes the female. Things can be male, too, like adapters that have male parts that fit into female parts. Most male animals are bigger than females, but not all. The biggest blue whales are female.

The speculation is that this is nature’s way of countering the relatively high mortality rates of males, and creating more of a gender balance in the population. While historically, there have been about 105 boys born for every 100 girls worldwide — which creates a “sex ratio at birth” of 1.05 — the share of boy babies has increased in recent decades. 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 1.07, or 107 boys born for every 100 girls.  This increase in the sex ratio is driven largely by births in China, where sex ratios have declined slightly in recent years but remain the highest in the world. The world’s most populous country has 118 boys for every 100 girls, and accounts for 12% of births worldwide. However, disproportionately large shares of baby boys are found in other countries scattered throughout Asia and the Caucasus, as well. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, South Korea, and the Solomon Islands round out the list of places with the highest sex ratios. India is tied with Macedonia, Montenegro, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Serbia and Suriname for 7th place, with a ratio of 108 boys born for every 100 girls.  Even while some countries seem to have a disproportionate share of boys, others have particularly high shares of baby girls. While there are still slightly more boys born than girls in these places — which are centered in sub-Saharan Africa — the sex ratios are nonetheless much lower than average. The six countries with the lowest sex ratios include: Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, and Madagascar.  So what explains these differences in the shares of baby boys and girls?  Perhaps the best-known reason relates to the practice of sex-selective abortion , which has been identified in Asia, and in the Caucasus , as well. The ability to determine fetal sex, along with strong son preferences, accounts in large part for the high shares of boys in many countries in these regions. The desire to limit family size, either due to government regulations as in China, or due to global social and economic changes that have reduced the need for large families, seems to further contribute to sex-selective abortion and a dearth of baby girls.  But this is only one of myriad factors that may be affecting the sex ratio at birth. Some research suggests that the share of newborn boys declines with older parents , and that the high share of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa may be linked to the practice of polygamy (multiple wives). What do these two phenomena have in common? Researchers hypothesize that both situations are associated with less frequent intercourse . (For possible explanations of this association, see this article from the academic journal Human Reproduction .)  On the opposite end of the spectrum, most research shows that the share of baby boys increases during and after wartime . And once again, frequency of intercourse is cited as the likely reason, at least in the case of post-war reunions.  In some cases, though, wartime is associated with a higher share of girl babies. This may relate to the fact that heightened maternal stress , such as would occur during wartime, can lead to an increased likelihood of a miscarriage which is more likely to occur among male fetuses .  Further evidence of this association between maternal stress and the increased share of girl babies emerges from an analysis of births in the vicinity of the Kobe earthquake in Japan, which showed that the share of females born nine months after that event was significantly higher than would have been expected under normal circumstances.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

If you have a family of all boys or all girls, it may be hard to believe that it's the result of only chance! Check out what statistics and data on a large number of families show us.  50/50 Odds  If there are roughly even odds of having a boy or a girl with each baby, given the laws of chance we should still expect to see some all same-gender families, even in large families.  Here is the number of all same-gender families we would expect to see, purely by 50/50 chance:   Family Size Same-Gender  Mixed-Gender  2 Children 50%   50%  3 Children 25% 75%  4 Children 12.5% 87.5%  5 Children 6%   94%  6 Children 3% 97%  7 Children 1.6% 98.4%   That's according to statistics! But does reality follow those odds? In a moment we'll compare the 50/50 odds with real population data for thousands of families to see if same-gender families actually occur more often than we'd expect just by chance; but first, let's talk about:  Are boys and girls like a coin toss?  My twins' math teacher introduced the class to probablilty by having the kids flip a penny, and count the number of heads/tails. In a class of 20 children, each child flipped the coin 3 times. Five children flipped all heads or all tails!   What happened???   As expected, with 50/50 odds,  3 flips should result in all heads or all tails about 25% of the time. (Just like the odds of having 3 same-gender children are 25% on the chart above.)  Or, the teacher gave loaded coins to 5 children!   I think we can assume the teacher didn't pass out loaded coins!  But when we see a family of three boys or three girls, many of us automatically assume that there's some force at work -- especially if we're the parents of those three brothers or sisters! -- rather than just natural 50/50 odds.  It's harder to grasp when it's a baby instead of a penny: because three is a very SMALL number statistically speaking, but when you're talking about a family, three can seem like a big number. But the odds don't change!  What about bigger families?  When you see a family of say, six boys or six girls, it certainly seems like some kind of statistical fluke!  But take a look at the chart above: there's a 3% chance of having all boys or all girls with 6 children.  This means that out of 100 families with 6 children, it's not only possible to have all boys or all girls by chance alone, but we would expect to see three families with all boys or all girls, given completely even chances for each child being a boy or a girl! So in fact, it's not a fluke: just like if you had 100 people flip a coin six times, about 3 of them would get all heads or all tails -- with an evenly weighted coin.

Real Families  Now, remembering that the boy/girl birth ratio is actually 51/49, not 50/50, let's take a look at how often same-gender families occur in a population sample of thousands of families .   2-Child Families  All Boys   25.8% Actual  25.0% Predicted  Boy/Girl   52.2% Actual  50.0% Predicted  All Girls   22.0% Actual  25.0% Predicted  3-Child Families  All Boys   14.9% Actual  12.5% Predicted  Boy/Girl   73.0% Actual  75.0% Predicted  All Girls   12.1% Actual  12.5% Predicted  4-Child Families  All Boys   9.1% Actual  6.3% Predicted  Boy/Girl   85.4%  87.4%  All Girls   5.5% Actual  6.3% Predicted   In each case, we seem to see slightly more boys than we'd expect from 50/50 chance, probably due to the fact that 2% more boys are actually born in the normal 51/49 birth sex ratio.  This means the most likely explanation for same-gender families is simple chance.  In fact, it's good evidence that nothing else causes families to have all boys or all girls: if there were, we would see too many same-gender families, because we'd have those that occurred by chance alone, plus those caused by some other factor.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!

What are the signs I'm having a baby girl?  Take our boy or girl quiz      Video Boy or girl? Watch how your baby develops into a boy or girl.  You're bound to be curious about your baby's gender , even if you're waiting until the birth to find out. But what if you could tell just by the season in which you conceived, or by what job your partner has? Folk tales are one thing, but what real-life factors may affect the gender of your baby?  What are the signs I'm having a baby boy? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a boy if:  You and your partner are living together  One large study of 86,000 parents showed that couples who were living together when they conceived were slightly more likely to have a boy (Norberg 2004) .  Just over half (51.5 per cent) of couples living together before conception had a boy, compared with 49.9 per cent of those who lived apart. But why domestic bliss results in more boys is not entirely clear.  You've been living together for less than a year  If your relationship is new and exciting, you'll probably be having lots of sex (Brewis and Meyer 2005) . Frequent sex gives male sperm a slightly bigger advantage than usual.  Male sperm are lighter, have smaller heads, and shorter tails (Jongbloet 2004) . They can swim more easily through the slightly less hospitable fertile mucus , which coincides with the beginning and the end of your fertile window . This includes the time of ovulation (Jongbloet 2004) .  Some experts think that female sperm are more likely to reach the egg in the middle of your fertile period (James 2008) .  By having frequent sex, you are more likely to have sex at the start and end of your fertile window, when male sperm have a slight advantage.  You're feeling stressed  Boys tend to be conceived at times of sustained stress , such as during and following a war (Helle et al 2009, Hohmann et al 2010) .  One theory is that the mum's high stress levels leads to increases in testosterone and cortisol (Grant 2007, Grant and Irwin 2009) . This may lead to changes in the egg, which make it easier for male sperm to penetrate.  Just how this happens isn't clear, but there is still so much we don't know about the exact moment of conception .  You have a higher calorie intake  One study divided 740 British women into groups according to their calorie intake (Mathews et al 2008) . Of the women who had the highest energy intake (about 2,413 calories), 56 per cent had boys. Of the women who had the lowest energy intake (about 2,283 calories), only 45 per cent had boys.  Boys are more fragile and are statistically less likely to be conceived, or to survive pregnancy, when food is short. Girl sperm are more robust, so in harder times they may be more able to survive.  But it's clear that, whether you're having a boy or a girl, a healthy diet is important both before you conceive and during pregnancy .  What are the signs I'm having a baby girl? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a girl if:  You're over 35 years old and the dad-to-be is over 40 years old  The older the mum and dad , the more likely the female sperm are to fertilise the egg (Matsuo et al 2009) . This could be due to hormonal influences in the woman as she ages. And in older dads , the female sperm is more likely to win the race. The quality of sperm deteriorates with age and older men produce fewer male sperm.  Or it could be because we tend to have sex less often (Brewis 2005) as we get older. Also, older couples may be more likely to have sex in the middle of the fertile period, when female sperm may have the edge over male sperm.  You suffer badly from pregnancy sickness  If you have severe pregnancy sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum), you're slightly more likely to have a baby girl.  A review of 13 studies found that 55 per cent of babies born to women who'd had severe pregnancy sickness were girls (Veenendaal et al 2011) . This was compared with 49 per cent in the control group of women who didn't suffer from it. Some experts think that this is due to high levels of the hormone oestrogen, which is linked with pregnancy sickness .  You were born in a tropical climate and conceived there  Fancy a long holiday, somewhere warm?  It's not clear how much time you and your partner would need to spend in a tropical climate for there to be any effect, or if you would need to have been born there, too. But a global survey of birth data showed that more girls are born in the tropics (the region around the equator) than anywhere else in the world (Navara 2009) .  One theory is that the hormone melatonin has an effect. Melatonin causes changes in the reproductive systems of animals in response to the length of the day. More females are born when the days are longer. Or it could be that a high temperature alters the survival of male or female sperm in semen.  Your baby was conceived in the winter  However, in some countries, more girls are conceived in winter, and more boys are conceived in the summer (Cagnacci et al 2003, Melnikov and Grech 2003) . Farmers have noticed this effect in their animals for many years.  This may be because more viral and bacterial infections are around in the winter. As male sperm and embryos are more fragile, girls may be more able to withstand mums catching infections than boys.  Dad-to-be's job involves pollutants or stress  A few studies have looked at the dad's occupation and the ratio of boys and girls born to them. They found that jobs that involve stress or pollutants seem to result in more girls.  Though they were small-scale studies, which only looked at certain occupations, dads with the following jobs resulted in more girls than average:   professional driver (James 2008) deep-sea diver (James 2008) submarine sonar technician (Volk 2004) flour mill worker (Milham and Ossiander 2008) high-performance pilot (James 2008)  You conceived after having your ovulation induced hormonally  Some studies carried out among women who used hormones to induce ovulation, such as clomifene , show that you are slightly more likely to have a girl if artificial hormones are involved (James 2008) . However, other experts aren't convinced.  You already have two or more children  It's possible that the more children you have, the more likely you are to have a girl. This may be due to the fact that the more pregnancies you have, the higher your levels of the hormone gonadotrophin (James 1980) . Some experts have claimed that these higher hormonal levels could be linked to a higher chance of having a girl.
