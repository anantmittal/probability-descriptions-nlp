New app analyzes odds of your flight crashing By Karla Cripps , CNN Updated 9:49 AM ET, Fri January 23, 2015 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. New app "Am I Going Down?" uses aviation statistics to analyze the odds a flight will crash. Story highlights Am I Going Down? app is aimed at people who suffer from a fear of flying Creator says his app will show nervous fliers that air travel is typically very low risk (CNN) If you're flying on a Boeing 777 Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles on any given day, there's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your plane will crash. At least that's what a new app called "Am I Going Down?" says. That means if you take that flight every day for the next 11,146 years, you'll be unlikely to experience an incident. Created by London-based company Vanilla Pixel, the app uses real flight statistics to analyze flight safety, Developer Nic Johns says it's geared toward those who are uneasy about air travel. Read More "The initial inspiration comes from my co-founder and wife, Julie, who for many years has suffered from a fear of flying," says Johns. "In developing 'Am I Going Down?' I wanted to present the fact that the vast majority of flights are incredibly low risk. Our app is meant as tool to help reassure fearful fliers." Johns says more than 10 million routes have been assessed using data from sources such as the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization. "For my analysis I only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality -- which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying," says Johns. "I then incorporate the volume of flights, weighted to the most recent 10 years, to provide the final 'one in a million' statistics." Bad timing? Johns admits the timing of the release of the app was awkward, given that it came out just days after AirAsia flight QZ8501 went down. The developer says it was an unfortunate coincidence. "I actually developed the app in February 2014, shortly before the Malaysia Airlines MH370 disappearance," says Johns. "Due to that I postponed the release and worked on a few other things, then finalized and submitted it to Apple in December. The AirAsia QZ8501 flight crashed two weeks later. "There have been a few raised eyebrows but most people know it was a coincidence." The "Am I Going Down?" app, now available in iTunes, costs $0.99. It's only available on Apple at the moment though if the app is successful, an Android version is a possibility for the future, says Johns. "The positive response from anxious fliers has been amazing, really encouraging," says Johns.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

All Rights Reserved.               / Maggie Koerth-Baker / 6:51 am Mon  Nov 5, 2012          Surviving a plane crash is surprisingly common             From the Boing Boing Shop     See all deals           Follow Us  Twitter / Facebook / RSS       I'm a nervous flyer. But I'm a lot better at it then I used to be. That's because, a few years ago, I learned that it's actually pretty common to survive a plane crash. Like most people, I'd assumed that the safety in flying came from how seldom accidents happened. Once you were in a crash situation, though, I figured you were probably screwed. But that's not the case.  Looking at all the commercial airline accidents between 1983 and 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board found that 95.7% of the people involved survived. Even when they narrowed down to look at only the worst accidents, the overall survival rate was 76.6%. Yes, some plane crashes kill everyone on board. But those aren't the norm. So you're even safer than you think. Not only are crashes incredibly rare, you're more likely to survive a crash than not. In fact, out of 568 accidents during those 17 years, only 71 resulted in any fatalities at all.  I was talking about this fact with a pilot friend over the weekend, and he mentioned one crash in particular that is an excellent example of the statistics in action. On July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 lost all its hydraulic controls and landed in Sioux City, Iowa, going more than 100 mph faster than it should have been. You can see the plane breaking apart and bursting into flames in the video above. Turns out, that's what a 62% survival rate looks like. (All the pilots you can hear talking in the video survived, too.)  Read more about United Airlines 232 on Wikipedia  Read the full NTSB report from 2001  In 2007, Popular Mechanics examined 36 years of NTSB reports and found that the majority of surviving passengers were sitting in the back of the plane. But that seems to depend a lot on the specifics of the crash and may not be a reliable predictor of future results.  Thanks, Shav!

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Feeling somewhat nervous about it? You have absolutely no reason to be worried; probability is on your side. Grab some peanuts, put your headphones in, sit back and relax. The airplane has revolutionized our existence. It has cut journeys that used to take weeks and months into just a few hours. It's also extremely safe, but people continue to fear it. A recent plane crash in the French Alps may have increased people's anxieties. Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed on Tuesday not long before 11 am. Tragically, everyone on board, 144 passengers and six crew members, died in the process. Germanwings is now a trending topics on social media and will undoubtedly continue to be discussed in the coming weeks. Along with "Pretty Little Liars" and Angelina Jolie, it's currently one of the top subjects people are searching for, Google Trends reveals . We are both terrified of and fascinated by death, particularly when it happens in unusual ways. The likelihood of dying in a plane crash (or even being in one) is so slim it's almost pointless to quantify. According to The Economist , the probability of your plane going down is around one in 5.4 million. Other reports place the odds closer to one in 11 million . To put this into perspective, you are far more likely to be struck by lightning or attacked by a shark than you are to die in a plane crash. And there are even more common things that kill decidedly more frequently, including the flu . Traveling by car is 100 times more deadly than hopping on a plane. Not to mention, statistically, it's never been safer to fly . Perhaps this helps explain why we become so captivated by plane crashes when they do occur; they're just so incredibly rare. At the same time, media coverage of these sorts of events is undeniably excessive and hyperbolic. This trend is driven by a desire for increased viewership and profits. Does this say more about the media or more about us? It's a two-way street: Major news networks consistently report on tragedies because they know the public will pay attention. In 2014, plane crashes often dominated the news. From the mysterious disappearance of MH370 to the tragic crash of Air Asia Flight 8501 in December, there were eight fatal plane crashes over the course of the year. In total, commercial airline accidents killed 992 people across the globe in 2014, the most since 2005, Vice reports . But if you look at data surrounding airplane crashes in a broader sense, they have decreased exponentially over time, as highlighted by the Guardian . And at this point last year, there had already been 33 plane crashes . As of the Germanwings crash, the number for 2015 stands at 17 . It's also very telling that in 2014, airplane crashes received 43 percent more media attention than the 1.24 million ground traffic fatalities that occur across the world every year, as noted by the Washington Post. Interestingly, research has shown that the habitual coverage of plane crashes hasn't necessarily served to increase fears of flying , but it certainly hasn't helped deter them, either . Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects around 6.5 percent of the population, ABC news reports . A survey from Chapman University suggests that 43 percent of people have at least some fear of flying, and around 9 percent are so afraid they won't even step foot on a plane. The fear is so ubiquitous there's even an iPhone app called "Am I Going Down?," which helps calculate how likely it is your flight will crash. Thankfully, it usually helps reveal how low the probability is: With that said, none of this information will serve to comfort the loved ones of those who died on the Germanwings flight. Perhaps they would find some relief, however, if they weren't inundated with images of the place those closest to them perished. Should there be a discussion surrounding why this plane crashed? Absolutely. But that doesn't require 24/7 coverage of the crash site. At any given moment over the course of the next 24 hours, people will die from poverty, famine, disease, war and other forms of abhorrent violence. Simultaneously, we face the ongoing effects of climate change and inequality. Perhaps we should refocus our obsession onto these kinds of issues. It would be nice to live in a world where issues are granted attention based on their everyday impact and imminence, rather than their potential to generate profits in correlation with the whims of a fickle public. Maybe that's just wishful thinking, but it's certainly still something to think about.

Brianna Hansen   Brianna Hansen  May 23, 2016                              17726  views                             17726  views          comments             With the recent disappearance of EgyptAir flight 804, the
fear of flying has reawakened within many Americans. With stories of vanishing planes in mind, Americans may find themselves wondering if something like that could happen to them. Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects roughly 20 million people worldwide, and is a very understandable fear. The idea of being left helpless in an
emergency situation that occurs 30,000 feet above the ground is terrifying. When you decide to board a
plane, you lose control over your fate. If an accident did strike, you would have
no way to help yourself or to escape the situation! Very scary stuff to think about. However, to keep things in perspective, your chances of being in a plane
crash are extremely low, 1 in 11 million , to be exact. The odds of experiencing
one of the following are much more likely. 1. Being born with an extra finger or toe 1 in 500. 2. Becoming President of the United States 1 in 10 million. ( I'll admit that your chances are slim, but it is still more likely than dying in a plane crash.) 3. Getting killed from a meteorite 1 in 700,000. 4. Giving birth to conjoined twins 1 in 200,000. 5.  Winning an Oscar 1 in 11,500. 6. Dying from a bee sting 1 in 79,842. 7. Winning an Olympic gold medal 1 in 662,000. (Assuming you can qualify for the Olympics first…) 8. Dying from a flesh-eating bacteria 1 in a million. 9. Drowning in your bathtub 1 in 840,000. 10.  Dating a millionaire 1 in 215. (Might just drop out of college and play the odds on this one.) 11. Getting murdered 1 in 18,000. 12. Getting killed by a bear at Yellowstone National Park 1 in 2.1 million. 13. Dating a supermodel 1 in 88,000. 14. Writing a New York Times bestseller 1 in 220. 15. Having your ID stolen 1 in 465. 16. Dying in a tornado 1 in 60,000. 17. Getting poisoned 1 in 1,400. 18. Dying in a skydiving accident 1 in 100,000. 19. Becoming a nudist 1 in 6,000. 20. Meeting someone who speaks Cherokee 1 in 15,000. 21. Living to 100 years old 1 in 3.

Allison Music   Allison Music  Apr 10, 2018                             19  views                             19  views          comments         Over spring break, I traveled to the beautiful country of Denmark. While I have traveled to other countries, none of them have been as different as Denmark. Here are a list of things that I noticed were different in the United States. 1. Everything is so much more expensive. I've already talked about this a little in a previous article I have written, but when I say this place is expensive, I mean it. A bottle of water in America is around $1.50 to $2.00. I bought a bottle of water in Denmark and it was upwards to $5.00. If you are planning a trip to Denmark, make sure to budget accordingly. Make sure you figure out what you want to spend your money on. I suggest getting an Airbnb and grocery shopping for breakfasts, lunches, or dinners. Eating in restaurants will add up really quickly. Try putting that money towards museums and other entertainment. Oh, also, public transportation is amazing, but also very, very expensive. Try to use the train as little as possible. Maybe rent a car or a bike, if you're just planning on staying in Copenhagen. But, if you are traveling around the country, consider a bus. Gas prices are, you guessed it, way more expensive in Denmark. Do your research about the cheapest ways to get around, depending on the cities or towns you'd like to visit. 2. The people are friendly, but not in the way you're used to. Danish people get a horrible reputation. If you have read anything about the Danes, you've probably read they are rude and unfriendly. That is the furthest from the truth. The Danes are so willing to help and will never give you the cold shoulder. However, do not expect the overly friendly type of people you'd find in America. They are willing to give you directions and help you out if you're confused, but you must approach them first. They do not talk to strangers first but will have no problem answering a question. Just don't small talk or ask them anything too personal. They like their privacy. Also, most of the Danes speak excellent English, so there is no trouble there. 3. The food is... interesting. I didn't hate the food. I actually liked the food a lot more than the food in Ireland, but it is not Italian cuisine. A lot of fish, egg, and mayo. Oh, and hotdogs. Don't be afraid to try it. Trust me, it is not as bad as it looks. I had a burger with what is called "red salad," which is just basically cranberries. Yes, you heard right. A burger with cranberries. Also, there was no beef on this burger. It was a type of slimy pork. It wasn't the best thing I have ever had, but it was an experience nevertheless. If you ever visit, you have to try the open faced sandwiches! The Danes swear by them. 4. Teenagers are allowed to drink and they are allowed to drink on the streets. The drinking age in Denmark is 15. Which means you'll get to see teenagers running around with beer cans just on the street. Denmark doesn't have a law against drinking in public, so it is completely legal and normal. Don't get too freaked out. I was in Aalborg and saw a group of people playing a drinking game right in a public park. You don't have to join the trend, but just try to act as normal as possible around it. The Danes think it's rude if you stare or are too judgmental. 5. Bikes are everywhere. In any of the major cities: Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, etc, you will see more bikes than cars. So much so, there is a specific bike lane for bikers. It is the size of a road. Biking is the cheapest and fastest way to get around in Denmark. Plus, everyone really does care about the environment. Bikes has just become the most used form of transportation. When in Copenhagen, rent a bike. It is the best way to see the city. Remember to look for bikes too! They go faster than the cars and will not be happy about you walking in the bike lane. It is not a sidewalk. 6. Denmark is so safe. I'm not saying America isn't safe, but what I am saying, is people in Denmark leave their babies outside in a stroller while they are in a restaurant and this is normal. Their baby. Outside. And they aren't worried about someone kidnapping them. That is how safe this place is. Story time: I lost my wallet while I was in Aarhus. I got a call from Kent State the next day saying someone had found it and wanted to return in. A Dane literally contacted Kent State after seeing my flashcard wanting to return my wallet, which had cash and my credit cards in it. When I got it back, everything was still inside. Including old receipts. When I say this place is safe, I mean it's safe. Denmark is such a beautiful country and if you ever have the chance, visit. It's worth the many pennies.

Jacob Mitchener   Jacob Mitchener  Apr 9, 2018                             216  views                             216  views          comments         A beautiful and unique city known for everything ranging from its rich history to its active nightlife, Prague is a gem in the heart of the Czech Republic that cannot be missed. Located in the northwest of the Czech Republic, Prague has a beauty that can only be understood by traveling to the city itself. Before starting my trip to Europe, I asked the advice of several other travelers about which destinations they recommend that I travel to. High on the list of many of these travelers was Prague. With so many recommendations, I simply had to visit. But what makes this city such a favorite among both travelers and its inhabitants? To start with, I found the people of the Czech Republic to be very kind to their visitors; they wanted to share the country that they love so much with anyone who is willing to take the time to visit. As far as activities go, exploring Prague without a map was one of my favorite experiences in the city. The day I arrived, I decided to wander around in search of food. In the process, I was able to get a glimpse of some of the famous architecture around the city, as well as some of its most iconic sights. After returning to my hostel, I was able to do some research into the history of these locations while also planning out the places I wanted to spend more time with. As far as specific attractions go, Prague is a perfect city to visit no matter your time frame. With that being said, a few of the most prominent and worthwhile attractions include the Charles Bridge, all of Old Town, Wenceslas Square, Petrin Hills, and Prague Castle. The main sights can be seen in a tour around the city in a day (which requires a ton of walking), but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend any more time there. Now let’s pretend you have just arrived in Prague and you are eager to see everything you can in just one walking journey. Doing this, I would suggest starting in Wenceslas Square and walking down the slope towards Old Town. A walk through Old Town takes you through the picturesque streets of Prague, while also allowing you to visit the Astronomical Tower, the Old Town Square, and St. Nicolas’ Church; all of which are well worth it if you find yourself in Prague. After seeing these iconic sights, wandering towards the Jewish Quarter of the city provides an opportunity to learn some of the history of the city through the years. From there, walk towards the river to see the concert hall known as Rudolfinum while listening to music written by Czech composers that you might not recognize by name, but you will recognize by their music. Walk along the Vltava River towards the Charles Bridge where you should take your time to take in the atmosphere and the unique architecture of the bridge as well as the views of Old Town and Prague Castle as they face off across the river. This walk brings you to the other side of the river where you can see the somewhat surprising Lennon Wall as well as taking a trip to Prague Castle. This walking trip provides an opportunity to see most major sights in Prague. Like with any city, it is possible to go into more detail if you so desire, and Prague is a city that deserves that extra attention. There are museums and historical sites littered throughout the city, and they are not hard to find. I visited the National Technical Museum in a quieter part of the city and I was blown away by the size and level of detail that the museum provided. Anyone with enough interest could spend a full day exploring every detail. In addition to that, the Jewish museum in the Jewish Quarter is well known and has the reputation of being very good, but I did not have the time to visit it, unfortunately. The Prague Castle allows for entry that is free of charge, but a ticket is required to visit some parts of the complex. Purchase of this ticket depends on the level of detail you wish to go into, and the amount of time you have to spend there. The activity that I highly recommend is taking a trip to the Petrin Hills where you can buy a ticket to ascend Petrin Tower where the views of the city are simply breathtaking. These examples stand as just a few options for ideas on how to make your trip to Prague as complete as you can want. After taking a walk around the city to see all of the sights, taking the public transportation provides for a welcome rest from all of the walking. The transportation is cheap and cost is based on time which makes it perfect for travelers who want unlimited travel for just a few days. As far as additional public transportation goes, taxis can be found throughout the city, but be sure to find a good price. In many instances, getting an Uber will be far more convenient and allow for the best possible price. The Czech Republic is a beautiful country and its capital city is the culmination of the country’s beauty. Prague is a city that should be on every traveler’s list for its uniqueness, its culture, and its people.

Photographer: Gill Allen/Bloomberg News      What are the chances of surviving in a plane crash? originally appeared on Quora : the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world .  Answer by Tom Farrier , Retired USAF rescue helicopter pilot; current aviation safety contractor (UAS), on Quora :  Ignore Hollywood. Aircraft involved in crashes are safer than at any time in history, thanks to decades of experience, research, and safety enhancements. According to Aviation Safety Network , in 2016 there were about one hundred and sixty three aviation “accidents” worldwide, including those involving business jets and military transports as well as jet and propeller airliners. A grand total of twenty-four resulted in fatalities, meaning only about 15% of all accidents in this grouping — which themselves are extremely rare events — actually resulted in lives being lost.    (FYI, only five of the fatal 2016 accidents were in the U.S, and none involved a major U.S. air carrier.)  Consider four possible outcomes to any crash:   You survive a survivable accident;  You survive a non-survivable accident;   You don’t survive a survivable accident; or  You don’t survive a non-survivable accident.   So, what the heck is a “survivable accident,” anyway? Well, to synthesize a couple of different takes on the subject, most in the aviation safety business (as well as those interested in other types of vehicle safety), look for three conditions:   The forces encountered by human occupants were within the limits of human tolerance;  The structure surrounding occupants remains substantially intact, maintaining an uncompromised volume around them; and  The post-crash environment does not present an immediate threat to occupants or rescuers.   In practical terms, this means directing forces away from people, slowing the onset of those that can’t be re-directed, preventing internal structures from failing in such a way as to stuck into the area where the carbon-based life forms are, and keeping the fire, smoke and fumes from easily starting or readily spreading. On this basis, you can see that a smoking hole in the ground is non-survivable, and there’s always a possibility that a small number of people don’t get the full benefit of protections that rendered the overall accident to be considered “survivable.” But, there are many, many examples to the contrary in events classified as “accidents” due to property damage and/or major injuries experienced in them.  In February of 2001, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board released the results of a comprehensive review of air carrier safety. They noted, “Fatal accidents such as TWA flight 800, ValuJet flight 592, and EgyptAir 990 receive extensive media coverage. Nonfatal accidents, however, often receive little coverage. As a result, the public may perceive that most air carrier accidents are not survivable. In fact, the Board's study shows that since 1983, more than 95% of the passengers survived.” (That includes accident where, given the criteria above, the accident itself should have been considered “non-survivable.)  A large contributor to this record goes to the many improvements the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required of air carriers over time. These included:   Improved seat cushions with reduced flammability.  Floor proximity emergency escape path marking.  Lavatory smoke detectors.  Lavatory fire extinguishers.  Halon fire extinguishers.  Improved interior materials.  Cargo compartment liners.  Cargo compartment fire detection/suppression.  Thermal/acoustic insulation.  16G seats.  Improved access to certain types of exits.   (These are expanded upon in a graphic available at FAA Fact Sheet: Improvements to Aircraft Survivability ).  If you keep passengers properly restrained until the noise dies down and the movement stops, you reduce the likelihood of a fire starting in the first place, you delay its propagation, and you make the by-products of burning stuff less toxic, you have a much better chance of keeping everybody alive.  This was Air France 358, following a landing that went bad at Toronto-Pearson International Airport in 2005:  (Photo: CBS.com )   (Photo: blogto.com )  Everybody lived.  This was Asiana Airlines 214, which hit the sea wall in front of the runway touchdown zone on short final to San Francisco International on July 6, 2013:  (Photo: KTVU.com )  People were ejected from this aircraft during its post-impact tumble and break-up, but two of the only three people who died were accidentally struck by first responders in the confusion. There were many significant injuries suffered by the crew and passengers, but the aircraft did what it was supposed to do under extreme conditions — it protected its occupants as well as it possibly could, and it didn’t allow fire to spread until there was time to get everyone evacuated.  Bottom line: accidents are rare; when they happen, fatalities are that much rarer thanks to a lot of hard work and investment in making planes as safe as possible.

New app analyzes odds of your flight crashing By Karla Cripps , CNN Updated 9:49 AM ET, Fri January 23, 2015 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. New app "Am I Going Down?" uses aviation statistics to analyze the odds a flight will crash. Story highlights Am I Going Down? app is aimed at people who suffer from a fear of flying Creator says his app will show nervous fliers that air travel is typically very low risk (CNN) If you're flying on a Boeing 777 Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles on any given day, there's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your plane will crash. At least that's what a new app called "Am I Going Down?" says. That means if you take that flight every day for the next 11,146 years, you'll be unlikely to experience an incident. Created by London-based company Vanilla Pixel, the app uses real flight statistics to analyze flight safety, Developer Nic Johns says it's geared toward those who are uneasy about air travel. Read More "The initial inspiration comes from my co-founder and wife, Julie, who for many years has suffered from a fear of flying," says Johns. "In developing 'Am I Going Down?' I wanted to present the fact that the vast majority of flights are incredibly low risk. Our app is meant as tool to help reassure fearful fliers." Johns says more than 10 million routes have been assessed using data from sources such as the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization. "For my analysis I only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality -- which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying," says Johns. "I then incorporate the volume of flights, weighted to the most recent 10 years, to provide the final 'one in a million' statistics." Bad timing? Johns admits the timing of the release of the app was awkward, given that it came out just days after AirAsia flight QZ8501 went down. The developer says it was an unfortunate coincidence. "I actually developed the app in February 2014, shortly before the Malaysia Airlines MH370 disappearance," says Johns. "Due to that I postponed the release and worked on a few other things, then finalized and submitted it to Apple in December. The AirAsia QZ8501 flight crashed two weeks later. "There have been a few raised eyebrows but most people know it was a coincidence." The "Am I Going Down?" app, now available in iTunes, costs $0.99. It's only available on Apple at the moment though if the app is successful, an Android version is a possibility for the future, says Johns. "The positive response from anxious fliers has been amazing, really encouraging," says Johns.

By Kara Godfrey     PUBLISHED:  11:09, Sat, Nov 4, 2017  | UPDATED: 16:33, Sat, Nov 4, 2017            Getty A plane is most likely to crash during this part of the flight Plane crashes are very rare, with flying being one of the safest ways to travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that in 2016, there was an average of one accident for every 2.86 million flights. With the odds of being killed in flight one in 11 million (compared to one in 5,000 for car accidents), many have nothing to fear regarding air travel. Despite this, there are two moments during a flight that plane crashes are much more likely.   Related articles       Can turbulence make a plane fall out of the sky?

Called the Plus Three Minus Eight rule, statistically, this is the most dangerous time, according to a Ben Sherwood, author of "The Survivors Club — The Secrets and Science That Could Save Your Life”. People are advised to follow the rule by not doing anything to hinder their escape, such as listening to music, taking their shoes off or falling asleep. After that, the likelihood of a plane crash is much lower and people can relax into the flight.

By Liz Fields  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Liz   Mar. 12, 2014   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images WATCH Life-Saving Statistics to Surviving a Plane Crash  0 Shares               Email      If you’re the kind of traveler whose nerves rattle along with the drinks cart every time your flight hits turbulence, you’re probably among the 40 percent of passengers who’ve experienced some fear at one time or another while flying. But beyond imaging the worst-case scenarios, what are the chances of your plane actually crashing? How likely are you to survive? The good news is that plane crashes remain extremely rare. Flying is still one of the safest methods of transportation. In fact, air experts say it’s more likely you’ll be involved in a crash driving to the airport than in one midflight. "If you take one flight a day, you would on average need to fly every day for 55,000 years before being involved in a fatal crash," M.I.T's Sloan School Statistician Arnold Barnett told ABC News. Around the world, the odds aren’t as good, but travelers would still need on average to take one flight a day for about 10,000 years before being involved in a fatal crash, Barnett said, adding the recent mystery revolving around missing Malaysian Airlines has served to make people more anxious about something that is statistically in our favor. "This is the fifth day the mystery of Malaysia plane is attracting the headlines and the cumulative effect of this quite naturally makes people nervous,” Barnett said. “If you remind people of something dangerous, it worries them, even if it’s incredibly rare.” The U.S. Department of Transportation’s comparison of accidental death risk on its website confirms that air travel featured relatively low among the list of alternative modes of transport. The DTT found Air carriers accounted for just 138 deaths a year among the general population, compared with 36,676 deaths by motor vehicle, 5,150 by large trucks and 3,112 by motorcycle over a five year average. Actually, you are far more likely to die from poisoning (15,206 deaths a year), at work (5,800) or even being electrocuted (410) than in a plane accident, the agency's research found. But for those unlucky enough to be involved in the small percent of fatal air accidents, what are the odds of survival if your plane does crash? The NTSB says that despite more people flying than ever, the accident rate for commercial flights has remained the same for the last two decades, and the survivability rate is a high 95.7 percent. The European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) has also examined the survivability of aircraft accidents worldwide, estimating that 90 percent are survivable (no passengers died) or “technically survivable," where at least one occupant survives. Most of those fatalities were a result of impact and fire-related factors including smoke inhalation after impact. The best option to maximize your chances of walking away from a plane crash is to sit up the rear end of the plane, according to crash test results conducted by scientists for Discovery TV last year. While airplane manufacturer, Boeing, claims on its website that “One seat is as safe as another,” a study by Popular Mechanics , which looked at the survival numbers from every commercial jet crash in the U.S. from 1971, found those sitting near the plane’s tail were 40 percent likelier to survive than those in the first few rows. Other tips that increase your chance of survival include bracing for impact (placing your head down and putting your hands over your head), while the FAA also advises to sit in an aisle within five rows away from an emergency exit and not to sleep during takeoff and landing, when the chances of a crash is highest. Boeing also recommends paying attention to flight attendants and dressing appropriately (“skip the short skirts, shorts and skimpy T-shirts”) in the event of an emergency. "Ultimately, it's highly unlikely you will be in a crash," said Barnett. “Whatever we find out about the Malaysian flight, this sort of thing is extraordinarily rare. You could take a flight every day in an average life span of 70-80 years and never run into trouble."       0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

GULLIVER will soon fly from Heathrow to Milan on a British Airways Airbus A319. That flight has a one-in-4.8m chance of crashing. Shortly after he is jetting from Heathrow to JFK on a Virgin-operated A330. Chance of crashing? One in 5.4m. That means that he could apparently expect to fly on the route for 14,716 years before plummeting into the Atlantic.

The Economist explains a day ago See more These figures come courtesy of “Am I Going Down?”, a recently released iPhone app that claims to calculate the odds of a disaster on a particular flight. Users input three variables: the departure and arrival airports, the airline, and the type of plane used. The app's maker hasn't responded to requests to give a little more detail of its methodology, but one presumes that it is a simple weighting of the proportion of crashes associated with each of those variables in the past. There are, of course, countless holes in such a simplistic approach. How does one decide the relative importance of the make of plane, airline or airport? Is past performance really an indicator of future performance? Does, for example, a Malaysia Airlines flight being shot out of the sky by Russian separatists make this event any more likely to happen again in the future? Is the calculation based on miles flown or the number of journeys? (As the take-off is the most dangerous phase of a flight, a 10,000 mile flight isn't twice as risky as a 5,000 mile one.) What about other important variables, such as the weather? The 14,716 years figure caused us a bit of confusion. But reader guest-isjswsa jumped in on the comments thread to shed some light on it. It’s the average length of time people will fly before crashing, if lots and lots of them do it every day. An alternative way of expressing it would be to say that if you were to arrange to fly this route every day for the next 10,210 years, your chance of dying would be 50%. And if you wanted to book enough flights to be almost certain of crashing, you reach a 99% probability at 67,833 years of daily flights. (For those interested in the maths, there is more here .) But perhaps this is a bit churlish. The idea behind the app is laudable, if not mathematically sound. Nic Johns, its creator, says he wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece. Of course, we all know this deep down. In real terms, it makes no difference if the chance of crashing is one in 1m or one in 9m; the likelihood is so small as to make the difference irrelevant. But there is a special place in our psyches for the fear of big, unlikely catastrophes. According to David Ropeik , author of " How Risky is it, Really? ", the deadliest plane crash in history occurred in 1977 in Tenerife when 583 people were killed after two jumbos collided on the runway. Yet, that many people die from heart disease in America every eight hours. As Mr Ropeik explains, air crashes are considered catastrophes while heart attacks are not, because they fulfil three criteria: A catastrophe has to be big, it has to happen all at once, and something about it has to be calamitous—disastrous—really bad. A plane crash certainly qualifies. It kills a lot of people all at once, in one place, and in a really horrific way. But heart disease [...] meets only one of those criteria. As awful as heart disease and stroke and diabetes are, they don't kill people in such vividly awful ways as plane crashes. It bears repeating just how rare such deaths in the air are. Safety statistics collated by IATA , an airline association, show that in 2013 more than 3 billion people flew on commercial aircraft. During that time there were 81 accidents and 210 fatalities. What is more, this figure has been falling for years (although the two recent Malaysia Airlines disasters will mean a blip when the 2014 figures are released). By way of comparison, the World Health Organisation says there were over 1.2m road traffic deaths around the world in 2010 . It is the leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds. The University of Oxford calculates that in 2006, Brits had odds of one in 36,512 of dying in a motor accident and one in 3.5m dying in a plane crash. Of course, many more people drive than fly; hence it is not easy to compare the two types of travel in a meaningful way. It is not known how many car journeys people take around the world, but even if it was, one would have to decide whether to compare the number of discrete trips or the overall distance travelled (that is an important distinction because if you were travelling from London to Edinburgh, for example, you might reasonably choose between driving and flying). Suffice to say what we all know: the fear of flying is incommensurate with its risk. And, as this chart from an Economist  piece last year highlights, that’s before we compare it to the really dangerous modes of transport, like using stairs.

New app analyzes odds of your flight crashing By Karla Cripps , CNN Updated 9:49 AM ET, Fri January 23, 2015 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. New app "Am I Going Down?" uses aviation statistics to analyze the odds a flight will crash. Story highlights Am I Going Down? app is aimed at people who suffer from a fear of flying Creator says his app will show nervous fliers that air travel is typically very low risk (CNN) If you're flying on a Boeing 777 Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles on any given day, there's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your plane will crash. At least that's what a new app called "Am I Going Down?" says. That means if you take that flight every day for the next 11,146 years, you'll be unlikely to experience an incident. Created by London-based company Vanilla Pixel, the app uses real flight statistics to analyze flight safety, Developer Nic Johns says it's geared toward those who are uneasy about air travel. Read More "The initial inspiration comes from my co-founder and wife, Julie, who for many years has suffered from a fear of flying," says Johns. "In developing 'Am I Going Down?' I wanted to present the fact that the vast majority of flights are incredibly low risk. Our app is meant as tool to help reassure fearful fliers." Johns says more than 10 million routes have been assessed using data from sources such as the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization. "For my analysis I only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality -- which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying," says Johns. "I then incorporate the volume of flights, weighted to the most recent 10 years, to provide the final 'one in a million' statistics." Bad timing? Johns admits the timing of the release of the app was awkward, given that it came out just days after AirAsia flight QZ8501 went down. The developer says it was an unfortunate coincidence. "I actually developed the app in February 2014, shortly before the Malaysia Airlines MH370 disappearance," says Johns. "Due to that I postponed the release and worked on a few other things, then finalized and submitted it to Apple in December. The AirAsia QZ8501 flight crashed two weeks later. "There have been a few raised eyebrows but most people know it was a coincidence." The "Am I Going Down?" app, now available in iTunes, costs $0.99. It's only available on Apple at the moment though if the app is successful, an Android version is a possibility for the future, says Johns. "The positive response from anxious fliers has been amazing, really encouraging," says Johns.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

But I'm a lot better at it then I used to be. That's because, a few years ago, I learned that it's actually pretty common to survive a plane crash. Like most people, I'd assumed that the safety in flying came from how seldom accidents happened. Once you were in a crash situation, though, I figured you were probably screwed. But that's not the case.  Looking at all the commercial airline accidents between 1983 and 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board found that 95.7% of the people involved survived. Even when they narrowed down to look at only the worst accidents, the overall survival rate was 76.6%. Yes, some plane crashes kill everyone on board. But those aren't the norm. So you're even safer than you think. Not only are crashes incredibly rare, you're more likely to survive a crash than not. In fact, out of 568 accidents during those 17 years, only 71 resulted in any fatalities at all.  I was talking about this fact with a pilot friend over the weekend, and he mentioned one crash in particular that is an excellent example of the statistics in action. On July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 lost all its hydraulic controls and landed in Sioux City, Iowa, going more than 100 mph faster than it should have been. You can see the plane breaking apart and bursting into flames in the video above. Turns out, that's what a 62% survival rate looks like. (All the pilots you can hear talking in the video survived, too.)  Read more about United Airlines 232 on Wikipedia  Read the full NTSB report from 2001  In 2007, Popular Mechanics examined 36 years of NTSB reports and found that the majority of surviving passengers were sitting in the back of the plane. But that seems to depend a lot on the specifics of the crash and may not be a reliable predictor of future results.  Thanks, Shav!

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Feeling somewhat nervous about it? You have absolutely no reason to be worried; probability is on your side. Grab some peanuts, put your headphones in, sit back and relax. The airplane has revolutionized our existence. It has cut journeys that used to take weeks and months into just a few hours. It's also extremely safe, but people continue to fear it. A recent plane crash in the French Alps may have increased people's anxieties. Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed on Tuesday not long before 11 am. Tragically, everyone on board, 144 passengers and six crew members, died in the process. Germanwings is now a trending topics on social media and will undoubtedly continue to be discussed in the coming weeks. Along with "Pretty Little Liars" and Angelina Jolie, it's currently one of the top subjects people are searching for, Google Trends reveals . We are both terrified of and fascinated by death, particularly when it happens in unusual ways. The likelihood of dying in a plane crash (or even being in one) is so slim it's almost pointless to quantify. According to The Economist , the probability of your plane going down is around one in 5.4 million. Other reports place the odds closer to one in 11 million . To put this into perspective, you are far more likely to be struck by lightning or attacked by a shark than you are to die in a plane crash. And there are even more common things that kill decidedly more frequently, including the flu . Traveling by car is 100 times more deadly than hopping on a plane. Not to mention, statistically, it's never been safer to fly . Perhaps this helps explain why we become so captivated by plane crashes when they do occur; they're just so incredibly rare. At the same time, media coverage of these sorts of events is undeniably excessive and hyperbolic. This trend is driven by a desire for increased viewership and profits. Does this say more about the media or more about us? It's a two-way street: Major news networks consistently report on tragedies because they know the public will pay attention. In 2014, plane crashes often dominated the news. From the mysterious disappearance of MH370 to the tragic crash of Air Asia Flight 8501 in December, there were eight fatal plane crashes over the course of the year. In total, commercial airline accidents killed 992 people across the globe in 2014, the most since 2005, Vice reports . But if you look at data surrounding airplane crashes in a broader sense, they have decreased exponentially over time, as highlighted by the Guardian . And at this point last year, there had already been 33 plane crashes . As of the Germanwings crash, the number for 2015 stands at 17 . It's also very telling that in 2014, airplane crashes received 43 percent more media attention than the 1.24 million ground traffic fatalities that occur across the world every year, as noted by the Washington Post. Interestingly, research has shown that the habitual coverage of plane crashes hasn't necessarily served to increase fears of flying , but it certainly hasn't helped deter them, either . Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects around 6.5 percent of the population, ABC news reports . A survey from Chapman University suggests that 43 percent of people have at least some fear of flying, and around 9 percent are so afraid they won't even step foot on a plane. The fear is so ubiquitous there's even an iPhone app called "Am I Going Down?," which helps calculate how likely it is your flight will crash. Thankfully, it usually helps reveal how low the probability is: With that said, none of this information will serve to comfort the loved ones of those who died on the Germanwings flight. Perhaps they would find some relief, however, if they weren't inundated with images of the place those closest to them perished. Should there be a discussion surrounding why this plane crashed? Absolutely. But that doesn't require 24/7 coverage of the crash site. At any given moment over the course of the next 24 hours, people will die from poverty, famine, disease, war and other forms of abhorrent violence. Simultaneously, we face the ongoing effects of climate change and inequality. Perhaps we should refocus our obsession onto these kinds of issues. It would be nice to live in a world where issues are granted attention based on their everyday impact and imminence, rather than their potential to generate profits in correlation with the whims of a fickle public. Maybe that's just wishful thinking, but it's certainly still something to think about.

Brianna Hansen   Brianna Hansen  May 23, 2016                              17726  views                             17726  views          comments             With the recent disappearance of EgyptAir flight 804, the
fear of flying has reawakened within many Americans. With stories of vanishing planes in mind, Americans may find themselves wondering if something like that could happen to them. Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects roughly 20 million people worldwide, and is a very understandable fear. The idea of being left helpless in an
emergency situation that occurs 30,000 feet above the ground is terrifying. When you decide to board a
plane, you lose control over your fate. If an accident did strike, you would have
no way to help yourself or to escape the situation! Very scary stuff to think about. However, to keep things in perspective, your chances of being in a plane
crash are extremely low, 1 in 11 million , to be exact. The odds of experiencing
one of the following are much more likely. 1. Being born with an extra finger or toe 1 in 500. 2. Becoming President of the United States 1 in 10 million. ( I'll admit that your chances are slim, but it is still more likely than dying in a plane crash.) 3. Getting killed from a meteorite 1 in 700,000. 4. Giving birth to conjoined twins 1 in 200,000. 5.  Winning an Oscar 1 in 11,500. 6. Dying from a bee sting 1 in 79,842. 7. Winning an Olympic gold medal 1 in 662,000. (Assuming you can qualify for the Olympics first…) 8. Dying from a flesh-eating bacteria 1 in a million. 9. Drowning in your bathtub 1 in 840,000. 10.  Dating a millionaire 1 in 215. (Might just drop out of college and play the odds on this one.) 11. Getting murdered 1 in 18,000. 12. Getting killed by a bear at Yellowstone National Park 1 in 2.1 million. 13. Dating a supermodel 1 in 88,000. 14. Writing a New York Times bestseller 1 in 220. 15. Having your ID stolen 1 in 465. 16. Dying in a tornado 1 in 60,000. 17. Getting poisoned 1 in 1,400. 18. Dying in a skydiving accident 1 in 100,000. 19. Becoming a nudist 1 in 6,000. 20. Meeting someone who speaks Cherokee 1 in 15,000. 21. Living to 100 years old 1 in 3.

Allison Music   Allison Music  Apr 10, 2018                             19  views                             19  views          comments         Over spring break, I traveled to the beautiful country of Denmark. While I have traveled to other countries, none of them have been as different as Denmark. Here are a list of things that I noticed were different in the United States. 1. Everything is so much more expensive. I've already talked about this a little in a previous article I have written, but when I say this place is expensive, I mean it. A bottle of water in America is around $1.50 to $2.00. I bought a bottle of water in Denmark and it was upwards to $5.00. If you are planning a trip to Denmark, make sure to budget accordingly. Make sure you figure out what you want to spend your money on. I suggest getting an Airbnb and grocery shopping for breakfasts, lunches, or dinners. Eating in restaurants will add up really quickly. Try putting that money towards museums and other entertainment. Oh, also, public transportation is amazing, but also very, very expensive. Try to use the train as little as possible. Maybe rent a car or a bike, if you're just planning on staying in Copenhagen. But, if you are traveling around the country, consider a bus. Gas prices are, you guessed it, way more expensive in Denmark. Do your research about the cheapest ways to get around, depending on the cities or towns you'd like to visit. 2. The people are friendly, but not in the way you're used to. Danish people get a horrible reputation. If you have read anything about the Danes, you've probably read they are rude and unfriendly. That is the furthest from the truth. The Danes are so willing to help and will never give you the cold shoulder. However, do not expect the overly friendly type of people you'd find in America. They are willing to give you directions and help you out if you're confused, but you must approach them first. They do not talk to strangers first but will have no problem answering a question. Just don't small talk or ask them anything too personal. They like their privacy. Also, most of the Danes speak excellent English, so there is no trouble there. 3. The food is... interesting. I didn't hate the food. I actually liked the food a lot more than the food in Ireland, but it is not Italian cuisine. A lot of fish, egg, and mayo. Oh, and hotdogs. Don't be afraid to try it. Trust me, it is not as bad as it looks. I had a burger with what is called "red salad," which is just basically cranberries. Yes, you heard right. A burger with cranberries. Also, there was no beef on this burger. It was a type of slimy pork. It wasn't the best thing I have ever had, but it was an experience nevertheless. If you ever visit, you have to try the open faced sandwiches! The Danes swear by them. 4. Teenagers are allowed to drink and they are allowed to drink on the streets. The drinking age in Denmark is 15. Which means you'll get to see teenagers running around with beer cans just on the street. Denmark doesn't have a law against drinking in public, so it is completely legal and normal. Don't get too freaked out. I was in Aalborg and saw a group of people playing a drinking game right in a public park. You don't have to join the trend, but just try to act as normal as possible around it. The Danes think it's rude if you stare or are too judgmental. 5. Bikes are everywhere. In any of the major cities: Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, etc, you will see more bikes than cars. So much so, there is a specific bike lane for bikers. It is the size of a road. Biking is the cheapest and fastest way to get around in Denmark. Plus, everyone really does care about the environment. Bikes has just become the most used form of transportation. When in Copenhagen, rent a bike. It is the best way to see the city. Remember to look for bikes too! They go faster than the cars and will not be happy about you walking in the bike lane. It is not a sidewalk. 6. Denmark is so safe. I'm not saying America isn't safe, but what I am saying, is people in Denmark leave their babies outside in a stroller while they are in a restaurant and this is normal. Their baby. Outside. And they aren't worried about someone kidnapping them. That is how safe this place is. Story time: I lost my wallet while I was in Aarhus. I got a call from Kent State the next day saying someone had found it and wanted to return in. A Dane literally contacted Kent State after seeing my flashcard wanting to return my wallet, which had cash and my credit cards in it. When I got it back, everything was still inside. Including old receipts. When I say this place is safe, I mean it's safe. Denmark is such a beautiful country and if you ever have the chance, visit. It's worth the many pennies.

Jacob Mitchener   Jacob Mitchener  Apr 9, 2018                             216  views                             216  views          comments         A beautiful and unique city known for everything ranging from its rich history to its active nightlife, Prague is a gem in the heart of the Czech Republic that cannot be missed. Located in the northwest of the Czech Republic, Prague has a beauty that can only be understood by traveling to the city itself. Before starting my trip to Europe, I asked the advice of several other travelers about which destinations they recommend that I travel to. High on the list of many of these travelers was Prague. With so many recommendations, I simply had to visit. But what makes this city such a favorite among both travelers and its inhabitants? To start with, I found the people of the Czech Republic to be very kind to their visitors; they wanted to share the country that they love so much with anyone who is willing to take the time to visit. As far as activities go, exploring Prague without a map was one of my favorite experiences in the city. The day I arrived, I decided to wander around in search of food. In the process, I was able to get a glimpse of some of the famous architecture around the city, as well as some of its most iconic sights. After returning to my hostel, I was able to do some research into the history of these locations while also planning out the places I wanted to spend more time with. As far as specific attractions go, Prague is a perfect city to visit no matter your time frame. With that being said, a few of the most prominent and worthwhile attractions include the Charles Bridge, all of Old Town, Wenceslas Square, Petrin Hills, and Prague Castle. The main sights can be seen in a tour around the city in a day (which requires a ton of walking), but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend any more time there. Now let’s pretend you have just arrived in Prague and you are eager to see everything you can in just one walking journey. Doing this, I would suggest starting in Wenceslas Square and walking down the slope towards Old Town. A walk through Old Town takes you through the picturesque streets of Prague, while also allowing you to visit the Astronomical Tower, the Old Town Square, and St. Nicolas’ Church; all of which are well worth it if you find yourself in Prague. After seeing these iconic sights, wandering towards the Jewish Quarter of the city provides an opportunity to learn some of the history of the city through the years. From there, walk towards the river to see the concert hall known as Rudolfinum while listening to music written by Czech composers that you might not recognize by name, but you will recognize by their music. Walk along the Vltava River towards the Charles Bridge where you should take your time to take in the atmosphere and the unique architecture of the bridge as well as the views of Old Town and Prague Castle as they face off across the river. This walk brings you to the other side of the river where you can see the somewhat surprising Lennon Wall as well as taking a trip to Prague Castle. This walking trip provides an opportunity to see most major sights in Prague. Like with any city, it is possible to go into more detail if you so desire, and Prague is a city that deserves that extra attention. There are museums and historical sites littered throughout the city, and they are not hard to find. I visited the National Technical Museum in a quieter part of the city and I was blown away by the size and level of detail that the museum provided. Anyone with enough interest could spend a full day exploring every detail. In addition to that, the Jewish museum in the Jewish Quarter is well known and has the reputation of being very good, but I did not have the time to visit it, unfortunately. The Prague Castle allows for entry that is free of charge, but a ticket is required to visit some parts of the complex. Purchase of this ticket depends on the level of detail you wish to go into, and the amount of time you have to spend there. The activity that I highly recommend is taking a trip to the Petrin Hills where you can buy a ticket to ascend Petrin Tower where the views of the city are simply breathtaking. These examples stand as just a few options for ideas on how to make your trip to Prague as complete as you can want. After taking a walk around the city to see all of the sights, taking the public transportation provides for a welcome rest from all of the walking. The transportation is cheap and cost is based on time which makes it perfect for travelers who want unlimited travel for just a few days. As far as additional public transportation goes, taxis can be found throughout the city, but be sure to find a good price. In many instances, getting an Uber will be far more convenient and allow for the best possible price. The Czech Republic is a beautiful country and its capital city is the culmination of the country’s beauty. Prague is a city that should be on every traveler’s list for its uniqueness, its culture, and its people.

Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google                 Quora    ,      Contributor        Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Photographer: Gill Allen/Bloomberg News      What are the chances of surviving in a plane crash? originally appeared on Quora : the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world .  Answer by Tom Farrier , Retired USAF rescue helicopter pilot; current aviation safety contractor (UAS), on Quora :  Ignore Hollywood. Aircraft involved in crashes are safer than at any time in history, thanks to decades of experience, research, and safety enhancements. According to Aviation Safety Network , in 2016 there were about one hundred and sixty three aviation “accidents” worldwide, including those involving business jets and military transports as well as jet and propeller airliners. A grand total of twenty-four resulted in fatalities, meaning only about 15% of all accidents in this grouping — which themselves are extremely rare events — actually resulted in lives being lost.    (FYI, only five of the fatal 2016 accidents were in the U.S, and none involved a major U.S. air carrier.)  Consider four possible outcomes to any crash:   You survive a survivable accident;  You survive a non-survivable accident;   You don’t survive a survivable accident; or  You don’t survive a non-survivable accident.   So, what the heck is a “survivable accident,” anyway? Well, to synthesize a couple of different takes on the subject, most in the aviation safety business (as well as those interested in other types of vehicle safety), look for three conditions:   The forces encountered by human occupants were within the limits of human tolerance;  The structure surrounding occupants remains substantially intact, maintaining an uncompromised volume around them; and  The post-crash environment does not present an immediate threat to occupants or rescuers.   In practical terms, this means directing forces away from people, slowing the onset of those that can’t be re-directed, preventing internal structures from failing in such a way as to stuck into the area where the carbon-based life forms are, and keeping the fire, smoke and fumes from easily starting or readily spreading. On this basis, you can see that a smoking hole in the ground is non-survivable, and there’s always a possibility that a small number of people don’t get the full benefit of protections that rendered the overall accident to be considered “survivable.” But, there are many, many examples to the contrary in events classified as “accidents” due to property damage and/or major injuries experienced in them.  In February of 2001, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board released the results of a comprehensive review of air carrier safety. They noted, “Fatal accidents such as TWA flight 800, ValuJet flight 592, and EgyptAir 990 receive extensive media coverage. Nonfatal accidents, however, often receive little coverage. As a result, the public may perceive that most air carrier accidents are not survivable. In fact, the Board's study shows that since 1983, more than 95% of the passengers survived.” (That includes accident where, given the criteria above, the accident itself should have been considered “non-survivable.)  A large contributor to this record goes to the many improvements the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required of air carriers over time. These included:   Improved seat cushions with reduced flammability.  Floor proximity emergency escape path marking.  Lavatory smoke detectors.  Lavatory fire extinguishers.  Halon fire extinguishers.  Improved interior materials.  Cargo compartment liners.  Cargo compartment fire detection/suppression.  Thermal/acoustic insulation.  16G seats.  Improved access to certain types of exits.   (These are expanded upon in a graphic available at FAA Fact Sheet: Improvements to Aircraft Survivability ).  If you keep passengers properly restrained until the noise dies down and the movement stops, you reduce the likelihood of a fire starting in the first place, you delay its propagation, and you make the by-products of burning stuff less toxic, you have a much better chance of keeping everybody alive.  This was Air France 358, following a landing that went bad at Toronto-Pearson International Airport in 2005:  (Photo: CBS.com )   (Photo: blogto.com )  Everybody lived.  This was Asiana Airlines 214, which hit the sea wall in front of the runway touchdown zone on short final to San Francisco International on July 6, 2013:  (Photo: KTVU.com )  People were ejected from this aircraft during its post-impact tumble and break-up, but two of the only three people who died were accidentally struck by first responders in the confusion. There were many significant injuries suffered by the crew and passengers, but the aircraft did what it was supposed to do under extreme conditions — it protected its occupants as well as it possibly could, and it didn’t allow fire to spread until there was time to get everyone evacuated.  Bottom line: accidents are rare; when they happen, fatalities are that much rarer thanks to a lot of hard work and investment in making planes as safe as possible.

New app analyzes odds of your flight crashing By Karla Cripps , CNN Updated 9:49 AM ET, Fri January 23, 2015 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. New app "Am I Going Down?" uses aviation statistics to analyze the odds a flight will crash. Story highlights Am I Going Down? app is aimed at people who suffer from a fear of flying Creator says his app will show nervous fliers that air travel is typically very low risk (CNN) If you're flying on a Boeing 777 Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles on any given day, there's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your plane will crash. At least that's what a new app called "Am I Going Down?" says. That means if you take that flight every day for the next 11,146 years, you'll be unlikely to experience an incident. Created by London-based company Vanilla Pixel, the app uses real flight statistics to analyze flight safety, Developer Nic Johns says it's geared toward those who are uneasy about air travel. Read More "The initial inspiration comes from my co-founder and wife, Julie, who for many years has suffered from a fear of flying," says Johns. "In developing 'Am I Going Down?' I wanted to present the fact that the vast majority of flights are incredibly low risk. Our app is meant as tool to help reassure fearful fliers." Johns says more than 10 million routes have been assessed using data from sources such as the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization. "For my analysis I only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality -- which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying," says Johns. "I then incorporate the volume of flights, weighted to the most recent 10 years, to provide the final 'one in a million' statistics." Bad timing? Johns admits the timing of the release of the app was awkward, given that it came out just days after AirAsia flight QZ8501 went down. The developer says it was an unfortunate coincidence. "I actually developed the app in February 2014, shortly before the Malaysia Airlines MH370 disappearance," says Johns. "Due to that I postponed the release and worked on a few other things, then finalized and submitted it to Apple in December. The AirAsia QZ8501 flight crashed two weeks later. "There have been a few raised eyebrows but most people know it was a coincidence." The "Am I Going Down?" app, now available in iTunes, costs $0.99. It's only available on Apple at the moment though if the app is successful, an Android version is a possibility for the future, says Johns. "The positive response from anxious fliers has been amazing, really encouraging," says Johns.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that in 2016, there was an average of one accident for every 2.86 million flights. With the odds of being killed in flight one in 11 million (compared to one in 5,000 for car accidents), many have nothing to fear regarding air travel. Despite this, there are two moments during a flight that plane crashes are much more likely.   Related articles       Can turbulence make a plane fall out of the sky?

Called the Plus Three Minus Eight rule, statistically, this is the most dangerous time, according to a Ben Sherwood, author of "The Survivors Club — The Secrets and Science That Could Save Your Life”. People are advised to follow the rule by not doing anything to hinder their escape, such as listening to music, taking their shoes off or falling asleep. After that, the likelihood of a plane crash is much lower and people can relax into the flight.

But beyond imaging the worst-case scenarios, what are the chances of your plane actually crashing? How likely are you to survive? The good news is that plane crashes remain extremely rare. Flying is still one of the safest methods of transportation. In fact, air experts say it’s more likely you’ll be involved in a crash driving to the airport than in one midflight. "If you take one flight a day, you would on average need to fly every day for 55,000 years before being involved in a fatal crash," M.I.T's Sloan School Statistician Arnold Barnett told ABC News. Around the world, the odds aren’t as good, but travelers would still need on average to take one flight a day for about 10,000 years before being involved in a fatal crash, Barnett said, adding the recent mystery revolving around missing Malaysian Airlines has served to make people more anxious about something that is statistically in our favor. "This is the fifth day the mystery of Malaysia plane is attracting the headlines and the cumulative effect of this quite naturally makes people nervous,” Barnett said. “If you remind people of something dangerous, it worries them, even if it’s incredibly rare.” The U.S. Department of Transportation’s comparison of accidental death risk on its website confirms that air travel featured relatively low among the list of alternative modes of transport. The DTT found Air carriers accounted for just 138 deaths a year among the general population, compared with 36,676 deaths by motor vehicle, 5,150 by large trucks and 3,112 by motorcycle over a five year average. Actually, you are far more likely to die from poisoning (15,206 deaths a year), at work (5,800) or even being electrocuted (410) than in a plane accident, the agency's research found. But for those unlucky enough to be involved in the small percent of fatal air accidents, what are the odds of survival if your plane does crash? The NTSB says that despite more people flying than ever, the accident rate for commercial flights has remained the same for the last two decades, and the survivability rate is a high 95.7 percent. The European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) has also examined the survivability of aircraft accidents worldwide, estimating that 90 percent are survivable (no passengers died) or “technically survivable," where at least one occupant survives. Most of those fatalities were a result of impact and fire-related factors including smoke inhalation after impact. The best option to maximize your chances of walking away from a plane crash is to sit up the rear end of the plane, according to crash test results conducted by scientists for Discovery TV last year. While airplane manufacturer, Boeing, claims on its website that “One seat is as safe as another,” a study by Popular Mechanics , which looked at the survival numbers from every commercial jet crash in the U.S. from 1971, found those sitting near the plane’s tail were 40 percent likelier to survive than those in the first few rows. Other tips that increase your chance of survival include bracing for impact (placing your head down and putting your hands over your head), while the FAA also advises to sit in an aisle within five rows away from an emergency exit and not to sleep during takeoff and landing, when the chances of a crash is highest. Boeing also recommends paying attention to flight attendants and dressing appropriately (“skip the short skirts, shorts and skimpy T-shirts”) in the event of an emergency. "Ultimately, it's highly unlikely you will be in a crash," said Barnett. “Whatever we find out about the Malaysian flight, this sort of thing is extraordinarily rare. You could take a flight every day in an average life span of 70-80 years and never run into trouble."       0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

GULLIVER will soon fly from Heathrow to Milan on a British Airways Airbus A319. That flight has a one-in-4.8m chance of crashing. Shortly after he is jetting from Heathrow to JFK on a Virgin-operated A330. Chance of crashing? One in 5.4m. That means that he could apparently expect to fly on the route for 14,716 years before plummeting into the Atlantic.

Users input three variables: the departure and arrival airports, the airline, and the type of plane used. The app's maker hasn't responded to requests to give a little more detail of its methodology, but one presumes that it is a simple weighting of the proportion of crashes associated with each of those variables in the past. There are, of course, countless holes in such a simplistic approach. How does one decide the relative importance of the make of plane, airline or airport? Is past performance really an indicator of future performance? Does, for example, a Malaysia Airlines flight being shot out of the sky by Russian separatists make this event any more likely to happen again in the future? Is the calculation based on miles flown or the number of journeys? (As the take-off is the most dangerous phase of a flight, a 10,000 mile flight isn't twice as risky as a 5,000 mile one.) What about other important variables, such as the weather? The 14,716 years figure caused us a bit of confusion. But reader guest-isjswsa jumped in on the comments thread to shed some light on it. It’s the average length of time people will fly before crashing, if lots and lots of them do it every day. An alternative way of expressing it would be to say that if you were to arrange to fly this route every day for the next 10,210 years, your chance of dying would be 50%. And if you wanted to book enough flights to be almost certain of crashing, you reach a 99% probability at 67,833 years of daily flights. (For those interested in the maths, there is more here .) But perhaps this is a bit churlish. The idea behind the app is laudable, if not mathematically sound. Nic Johns, its creator, says he wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece. Of course, we all know this deep down. In real terms, it makes no difference if the chance of crashing is one in 1m or one in 9m; the likelihood is so small as to make the difference irrelevant. But there is a special place in our psyches for the fear of big, unlikely catastrophes. According to David Ropeik , author of " How Risky is it, Really? ", the deadliest plane crash in history occurred in 1977 in Tenerife when 583 people were killed after two jumbos collided on the runway. Yet, that many people die from heart disease in America every eight hours. As Mr Ropeik explains, air crashes are considered catastrophes while heart attacks are not, because they fulfil three criteria: A catastrophe has to be big, it has to happen all at once, and something about it has to be calamitous—disastrous—really bad. A plane crash certainly qualifies. It kills a lot of people all at once, in one place, and in a really horrific way. But heart disease [...] meets only one of those criteria. As awful as heart disease and stroke and diabetes are, they don't kill people in such vividly awful ways as plane crashes. It bears repeating just how rare such deaths in the air are. Safety statistics collated by IATA , an airline association, show that in 2013 more than 3 billion people flew on commercial aircraft. During that time there were 81 accidents and 210 fatalities. What is more, this figure has been falling for years (although the two recent Malaysia Airlines disasters will mean a blip when the 2014 figures are released). By way of comparison, the World Health Organisation says there were over 1.2m road traffic deaths around the world in 2010 . It is the leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds. The University of Oxford calculates that in 2006, Brits had odds of one in 36,512 of dying in a motor accident and one in 3.5m dying in a plane crash. Of course, many more people drive than fly; hence it is not easy to compare the two types of travel in a meaningful way. It is not known how many car journeys people take around the world, but even if it was, one would have to decide whether to compare the number of discrete trips or the overall distance travelled (that is an important distinction because if you were travelling from London to Edinburgh, for example, you might reasonably choose between driving and flying). Suffice to say what we all know: the fear of flying is incommensurate with its risk. And, as this chart from an Economist  piece last year highlights, that’s before we compare it to the really dangerous modes of transport, like using stairs.
