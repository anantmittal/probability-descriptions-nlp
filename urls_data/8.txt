Detroit News Matthew Stafford (Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 29 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Detroit Lions (8-6) need to win their final two games to have a shot at making the playoffs. Here are the possibilities: Scenario 1: Atlanta (9-5) loses its final two games. And there’s a realistic possibility of this happening with the two foes in the mix for the NFC South crown. The Lions could end up tied with the Seahawks (8-6), Rams (10-4) or Cowboys (8-6) for the final spot, but would hold tiebreakers over all three. If the Rams lose their next two, the Lions would finish with a better conference record, the second tie-breaker after head-to-head. Detroit would have the same conference record as Seattle and Dallas. Moving to the next tiebreaker, common games, Detroit holds the advantage over both, having gone 4-1. There’s no way for Detroit to jump Atlanta, which holds head-to-head tiebreakers with Dallas and Seattle, and potentially New Orleans. Atlanta holds a two-game lead in conference record. Scenario 2: The remaining ways the Lions get in are all multi-team, tiebreaking scenarios. The Panthers would have to lose their final two games in this scenario and would be eliminated in the tiebreaker because of the worse conference record. It would then go to the teams’ common games, where the Lions beat the Seahawks and Cowboys. Scenario 3: The other NFC South possibility is the Saints lose out with the Cowboys/Seahawks winning out. Losing out would give the Saints five conference loses, eliminating them. Again, it goes to common games, where the Lions win out. Scenario 4: Any four- or five-team tie between Carolina/Seattle/ Dallas/New Orleans/Los Angeles/Detroit finishing 10-6 would result in Detroit making the playoffs.

return to playoffs in 2017                     John Buhler/Fansided         Jun 30, 2017 at 10:28p ET                       0 Shares         While the Detroit Lions lost their NFC Wild Card game to the Seattle Seahawks, here are five reasons that they will be back in the 2017 NFC Playoffs.  The 2016 Detroit Lions season came to an end on Saturday night, as they lost their NFC Wild Card game on the road to the Seattle Seahawks 26-6. Detroit stumbled down the stretch, but still managed to make the NFC Playoffs for the second time in three seasons.  Article continues below ...  Because both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Washington Redskins lost crucial games in the final weeks of the 2016 regular season, Detroit was able get in the NFC Playoffs as the No. 6 seed at 9-7 on the year.  Many didn’t believe in the Lions in 2016, but they did have their moments this fall. Entering 2016, the Lions were probably a year away from contending for a playoff spot in the NFC anyway. Overall, this team exceeded expectations and had a great year nevertheless. Here are five reasons the Lions making the NFC Playoffs wasn’t a fluke and they’ll be back in 2017.    5. Navigable 2017 season schedule  Because the Lions didn’t win the NFC North –that would be the Green Bay Packers– Detroit won’t play a first-place schedule in 2017. That absolutely helps their cause in getting back to the NFC Playoffs.  Instead of drawing teams like the Seahawks and the Dallas Cowboys next season, Detroit gets a bit of an easier draw in competitive balance, landing the Arizona Cardinals and the New York Giants as their other two games.  As for the 14 games that Detroit already knew it was going to play well in advance of 2017, the Lions will get the NFC South, the AFC North and its annual six division games. The NFC South usually has one dominant team, one playoff pretender and two teams that don’t know what they’re doing.  In the AFC North, the Pittsburgh Steelers are strong, but the Baltimore Ravens are inconsistent, the Cincinnati Bengals might be rebuilding, and then there is science experiment gone wrong known as the Cleveland Browns.  The NFC North probably has two playoff teams next season, including Detroit. It could be either the Packers or the Minnesota Vikings. The Chicago Bears are probably hapless for the foreseeable future in a clueless rebuild.  Next: 4. They already know how to win close games    Nov 6, 2016; Minneapolis, MN, USA; Detroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate (15) beats Minnesota Vikings free safety Harrison Smith (22) and scores a touchdown to win the game at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Lions won 22-16 in overtime. Mandatory Credit: Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports  4. They already know how to win close games Some will try to deconstruct the Lions’ nine regular season wins as being mostly the beneficiaries of either-or games. The Lions played in an absurd number of close games in 2016, most decided by seven points or less. While some could argue that the Lions were a 6-10 team masquerading as a 9-7 team, they did find a way to win these tight ball games and that matters. When games were tight, the Lions managed to play loose and grab the victory for the taking. There are four reasons for this that cannot be understated: 1.) Quarterback Matthew Stafford is a maestro in fourth-quarter comebacks and game-winning drives. 2.) Kicker Matt Prater will make the 50-yard field goal under intense pressure. 3.) The defense doesn’t collapse late in games under defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. 4. ) Head coach Jim Caldwell’s stoic demeanor only aids in the Lions being cool under pressure. The Lions may lose games in blowouts in 2017, but there seems to be too much good in how they conduct themselves in winning time for that to disappear after this season; call it the clutch gene or just being prepared. Lesser teams can’t deliver in those situations. Expect the Lions to win about five of those games next season. It’s in their DNA. Next: 3. A lot to like with this coaching staff   Nov 20, 2016; Detroit, MI, USA; Detroit Lions head coach Jim Caldwell looks on during the fourth quarter against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Ford Field. Lions won 26-19. Mandatory Credit: Raj Mehta-USA TODAY Sports  3. A lot to like with this coaching staff This is something that tends to get overlooked. The Lions have themselves a solid coaching staff with a proven head coach in Jim Caldwell and two strong coordinators in offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter and defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. Together, they give the Lions balance and a foundation that can breed success. Austin will eventually be an NFL head coach one day. He is adept at generating a pass rush and is starting to get some great play from his secondary. Detroit can get better against the run, but Austin’s defense was a major reason the Lions played in and won so many close games. Forget about his interesting name because Cooter can flat-out coach the quarterback position. Since taking over mid-season in 2015 as offensive coordinator we’ve seen Stafford become the best version of himself as an NFL passer. They have a great rapport and had some great success in the experimental offense this season. Detroit lacked high-profile weapons, a consistent running game and a busted Stafford finger to work around. Stafford and Cooter can grow together for the foreseeable future. Caldwell’s even keel allows the Lions to not get too high or too low. He knows his offensive personnel and is aware enough to surround himself with solid defensive coaches. Whether or not this is intentional, Caldwell and his staff are cultivating a Lions team that can thrive in on-field chaos. Playoff teams do that weekly. Next: 2. Matthew Stafford is in his prime   January 7, 2017; Seattle, WA, USA; Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford (9) throws against the Seattle Seahawks during the first half in the NFC Wild Card playoff football game at CenturyLink Field. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports  2. Matthew Stafford is in his prime It finally happened. 2016 was the coming out year for Lions starting quarterback Matthew Stafford. For a good part of the season, Stafford was a serious candidate for NFL MVP. He had this never-say-die mentality to playing quarterback for the Lions in so many of those fourth-quarter comebacks. Playing quarterback for a losing culture has not been easy for the former No. 1 overall pick out of the University of Georgia. He’s had unbelievable talent at the position, but long needed the stability around him to succeed. Stafford has found that with Caldwell at head coach and Cooter at offensive coordinator. Keep in mind that Stafford had his best season in his first year without Calvin Johnson, who retired from the NFL after nine seasons. Undoubtedly, the Lions became Stafford’s team after Johnson’s retirement. Stafford played unencumbered until suffering ligament damage to his middle finger on his throwing hand. That injury derail his and the Lions’ season in December, but he’s very much in his prime as a professional. As he approaches 30, Stafford should stay at this upper echelon of quarterbacking until his mid-30s. He has the arm talent that probably will never wane. For the first time since he played at Georgia, Stafford doesn’t seem to be burdened playing quarterback in Detroit. He’s already the best quarterback in franchise history. Look for him to take that next step in 2017 and be a serious MVP candidate into late December 2017. Next: 1. Bob Quinn is just getting started   Feb 24, 2016; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Detroit Lions general manager Bob Quinn speaks to the media during the 2016 NFL Scouting Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports  1. Bob Quinn is just getting started Detroit may have a navigable schedule, know how to win close games, have a solid coaching staff, and a star quarterback, but easily the biggest reason that the Lions will make the NFC Playoffs again in 2017 is that they have a strong architect in place in general manager Bob Quinn. He’s just getting started. The Lions were able to pry Quinn away from the New England Patriots in 2016 after being the director of pro scouting the last several years. This means that Quinn will be able to nail NFL drafts for the foreseeable future in Detroit. His connection to New England and seeing the Lions have success in his first year on the job means that Detroit could be a viable team in 2017 NFL free agency. Detroit will have roughly $41 million in salary cap room to make a few big splashes in free agency. The foundation looks promising in Detroit, as the Lions have built well through the draft. Next: NFL Power Rankings: 30 Best QB of All-Time Expect Quinn to consult Caldwell, Cooter, and Austin about which role players would best fit their team. A few minor tweaks to the Lions roster in free agency and another solid NFL Draft could definitely be enough to get the Lions back into the NFC Playoffs. It’s amazing what stability can do to an organization.

This week’s Monday Countdown is a five-course offering thrown together from the leftovers of the Detroit Lions’ 30-23 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thanksgiving Day.  In short, it’s a look at the possibility of the Lions making the playoffs, either by winning the NFC North (remote) or as a wild card (not good, either).  With five games left, the obstacles in the Lions’ path of reaching the postseason for the third time in four seasons under head coach Jim Caldwell are obvious.  They trail the first-place Vikings by three games in what a week ago was a two-team race for the North title and now looks like a runaway.  And in terms of the wild card, they are behind in won-loss records and tiebreakers because of losses to the Saints, Falcons and Panthers of the NFC South.  We start with the Lions’ chances:  1. Where the Lions stand: Losing to the Vikings kept them in second place in the North with a 6-5 record, but three games back of the Vikings when a win could have cut the margin to one game.  “If you’re around .500 a little bit before when you’re sitting down for your Thanksgiving meal, you’ve still got a chance,” Caldwell said after the game, repeating something he said he once heard.  “We’ve got a lot of football yet to play, and you don’t know what’s going to happen,” Caldwell said. “There’s other games that are being played too. I know the media will paint it like the sky is falling, but the sky is not falling for us.  “We’ve got to get ourselves a little bit better and keep moving forward.”  If you’re a head coach, you look ahead through the gloom of a crippling loss to the rays of hope.  One man’s opinion: It’s a long-shot hope because of the NFC’s crowded field of playoff contenders, but it isn’t no shot.  With a 6-5 won-loss record and five games left, the Lions have a chance to make the playoffs. To do that, they have to keep winning on the road, where they’re 4-1, and start winning at home, where they’re 2-4.  2. North race: It’s not over, but the Vikings look like the class of the division, and not just because of the numbers – a 9-2 record and three-game lead on the Lions.  The way they handled the Lions on Thanksgiving Day was impressive. In a pivotal game, they played like champs.  There wasn’t an area on offense or defense where the Lions had the advantage. The Vikings ran the ball better. They rushed the passer better. And for one game, Case Keenum had a better game than Matthew Stafford .  Vikings bottom line: With a seven-game winning streak, the Vikings show no signs of putting on the brakes. Their next two games are on the road against Atlanta and Carolina, but the final three aren’t nearly as tough – home against Cincinnati, at Green Bay and home against the Bears.  Don’t crown the Vikings yet, but the prospect of them playing the Super Bowl in their home stadium is not as far-fetched as it seemed at the start of the season.  3. Vikings flop, 2016: A three-game deficit with five left leaves a lot for the Lions to make up. But recent history shows that it’s possible.  The Vikings started 5-0 last season, while the Lions were three games behind at 2-3. The Vikings lost the next four games and were 6-4 after 10 games. The Lions went 4-1 and were 6-4 after 10 games.  The Lions went on to make the playoffs as a wild card at 9-7. The Vikings continued their skid to 8-8 and out of the postseason.  Bottom line: A similar fade like last season is unlikely. For one thing, the Vikings already are at nine wins. For another, they’re playing better ball than last year, and the Lions are the only other legitimate contenders.  The Lions and Packers both were contenders last year, and the Packers rallied to win the North by beating the Lions in a final-game showdown at Ford Field. With Aaron Rodgers currently out with a broken collarbone, the chance of another Packers comeback is remote.  4.  10 for the show: Again, based on recent history 10 wins are the minimum to make the NFC playoffs as a wild card. Only once in the previous seven seasons – from 2010-2016 – has a team made the NFC field as a wild card with a record of 9-7.  The exception: The 2016 Detroit Lions, who got in at 9-7.  In four of the last seven seasons, 10 wins did not qualify as a wild card. In 2010 the Giants and Bucs sat home at 10-6. Same for the Bears in 2012, the Cardinals in 2013 and the Eagles in 2014.  Bottom line: Win 10 games, you might get in. Win 11, you will. Win nine, stay at home.  5.  The schedule: Some teams above the Lions might sink in the standings. Some below might rise up. The Lions have to focus on their business and let the rest of us watch the schedule and make projections.  Three of the Lions last five games are on the road, against the Ravens, Bucs and Bengals. The two at home are against the Bears and Packers, teams the Lions already have beaten on the road, and teams the Lions should beat again at Ford Field, regardless of their 2-4 home record this season.  Predicting a five-game winning streak for the Lions is a flight of fancy, but picking them to win any of the five games from week to week is legitimate.  Bottom line: Improbable does not mean impossible, but the Lions have dug their way into a hole. They need help to climb out.

Either way, they have about a coin flip's chance of making the postseason. ( Mike Mulholland | MLive.com )      Comment       By Kyle Meinke  kmeinke@mlive.com       ALLEN PARK -- The Detroit Lions haven't won a division title since they took the old NFC Central in 1993. And it's probably not going to happen this year, either.  Football Outsiders, an advanced analytics site, has pegged Detroit's chances of winning the NFC North at 15.7 percent. Minnesota (8-2) is the runaway favorite at 83.4 percent, while Green Bay (5-5) somehow still clings to a 1 percent chance despite losing four of their last five games (not to mention their quarterback).  Of course, the Lions (6-4) could make things really interesting by knocking off Minnesota in their divisional showdown Thursday at Ford Field. The Vikings have won six straight to open a two-game lead, but Detroit already has a win in hand in the series.  With another win, the Lions would trim the lead to one with five to go. They'd hold the head-to-head tiebreaker, too, while also facing the easier schedule. They still have road trips to face Baltimore, Tampa and Cincinnati, plus home games against Chicago and Green Bay. None of those teams has a winning record.  The Vikings, meantime, head to Detroit, Atlanta and Carolina the next three weeks in a row. And after hosting Cincinnati, they are back on the road in Green Bay before wrapping up the season against Chicago.  Even if the Lions can't catch Minnesota, their chances of making the postseason are still 49.4 percent according to Football Outsiders. That's sixth best in the NFC.  Here are their chances by seed: 1: 0.1 percent 2: 0.9 percent 3: 7.3 percent 4: 7.4 percent 5: 10.5 percent 6: 23.2 percent Out: 50.6 percent     View Comments                  About Us    MLive Media Group    Our Team    Advertise    Frequently Asked Questions      Contact Us    Jobs at MLive      Subscriptions    Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters    The Ann Arbor News    The Bay City Times    The Flint Journal    The Grand Rapids Press    Jackson Citizen Patriot    Kalamazoo Gazette    Muskegon Chronicle    The Saginaw News        MLive Sections    News    Business    Sports    High School Sports    Entertainment    Living    Opinion    Obituaries      Jobs    Autos    Real Estate    Apartment Rentals    Classifieds    Local Deals    Local Businesses    Business Resource Center      Your Regional News Pages    Ann Arbor    Bay City    Detroit    Flint    Grand Rapids      Jackson    Kalamazoo    Lansing    Muskegon    Saginaw      Mobile    Mobile apps | Tablet apps        More on MLive    Photos    Video    Weather    Post a job      Post a free classified ad    Sell your car    Sell/Rent your home    Apartments and Rentals    Sponsor Content      Follow Us    Twitter | Facebook | YouTube        Advance Local  Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy   © 2018 MLive Media Group.

Jones against the Chicago Bears on Dec. 16, 2017 at Ford Field in Detroit. (Photo: Rey Del Rio, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 28 COMMENT EMAIL MORE With two weeks left in the regular season, the NFC playoff field is starting to take shape. And as the Lions get ready for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals, they still need lots of help to join the fun. The Atlanta Falcons moved a game closer to a playoff spot with a win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night. Already two NFC teams, the Eagles and Vikings, have locked up their divisions, and four more teams — the Falcons, Saints, Panthers and Rams — can clinch a spot with another win. The Lions’ playoff odds currently stand at 14%, according to FiveThirtyEight.com . They’ll be eliminated from postseason contention with their next loss, and since the Saints and Falcons meet in a win-and-in game this week (and the Falcons and Panthers play in Week 17), there are only a few scenarios in which they can get a wild card. Here, with the help of FiveThirtyEight’s prediction machine, are the realistic possibilities. (The Lions can make the playoffs with a win and a tie, but the likelihood of that happening is miniscule and thus not included in this breakdown.) Scenario 1: Lions win out, Falcons lose out The Lions would finish 10-6, the Falcons 9-7, and the Lions would be in, likely as the six seed. Either the Seahawks or Cowboys — they play each other on Sunday — also can finish with 10 wins, but the Lions own the tiebreaker over both. If by chance the Seahawks also win out, and the Rams lose their final two games, the Seahawks would win the NFC West and the Lions would win a tiebreaker with L.A. The Falcons (9-5) have two tough games left (at New Orleans, vs. Carolina), so while this is unlikely, it’s not totally improbable. Scenario 2: Lions win out, Saints lose out The Lions got drilled by the Saints in New Orleans and would lose a head-to-head tie-breaker if both teams finish with 10-6 records. However, the Lions would get in if there’s a three-team tie with the Saints and Cowboys or Seahawks, or a four-team tie with the Saints, Falcons and Cowboys or Seahawks. More Lions: Detroit Lions merely treading water in playoff chase despite victory Unacceptable for Lions' Jim Caldwell not to discuss division title failure Detroit Lions' Darius Slay might 'start a riot' if Pro Bowl denies him Head-to-head records only come into play if all tied teams have played each other, so the Lions would be eliminated if they finish in a three-way tie with any two other NFC South teams. In down-the-line tie-breakers like conference record and games against common opponents, the Lions fare well. Of course, the Saints (10-4) host Atlanta and play at Tampa Bay the next two weeks, so there’s a good chance they’ll get to at least 11 wins. Scenario 3: Lions win out, Panthers lose out Similar to Scenario 2, the Lions would lose a head-to-head tie-breaker with the Panthers if they are the only teams tied at 10-6 based on their Week 5 loss at Ford Field. If the Cowboys or Seahawks also win out to get to 10-6, the Lions would earn a wild card berth based on multi-team tie-breakers. The Panthers (10-4) host the Bucs and visit the Falcons the next two weeks, and they’ve won six of their past seven games. Scenario 4: Lions win out, Saints and Panthers lose out The same principles mentioned earlier apply here. If the Lions, Saints and Panthers are the only teams that finish with a 10-6 record, the Lions would miss the playoffs based on head-to-head results. If either the Cowboys or Seahawks also finish with 10 wins, both of the NFC South teams would miss the playoffs based on the NFL's tie-breaking procedures . The Lions could be the fifth seed in this scenario. Saints running back Alvin Kamara leaps over Lions cornerback Darius Slay during a game on Oct. 15, 2017 in New Orleans.  (Photo: Butch Dill, AP) Here's a closer look at the NFC wild card contenders New Orleans Saints (10-4) Remaining games : vs. Falcons, at Bucs Outlook : The Saints have lost two of their past four games, but get a chance to avenge one of those defeats this week against a Falcons team playing on short rest. There's a distinct chance they go 12-4, and in the playoffs they'll be a team no one wants to face. If they lose out, they leave the door open a crack for the Lions to make the playoffs. Carolina Panthers (10-4) Remaining games : vs. Bucs, at Falcons Outlook : The Panthers need one win to lock up a playoff spot, and they should get it this Sunday at home against a Tampa team that’s lost four straight. They still could win the NFC South and get a first-round bye, and if they lose out they’d win a two-team tiebreaker with the Lions based on head-to-head result, but lose a three-team tiebreaker based on conference record. Atlanta Falcons (9-5) Remaining games : at Saints, vs. Panthers Outlook : The Falcons have the toughest road left of the three NFC South playoff contenders, but they also have the best conference record if it comes into play in the case of tie-breakers. If the Falcons get one more win, they’ll be in the playoffs with a chance to defend their NFC title. Seattle Seahawks (8-6) Remaining games : at Cowboys, vs. Cardinals Outlook : The Seahawks and Cowboys play what’s essentially a playoff elimination game on Sunday. The winner still has a chance at a wildcard spot, the loser can start making plans for January. The Seahawks played their most uninspiring game of the season last week, and now they have to stop Ezekiel Elliott in his return from a six-game suspension. Seattle's defense will be faced with stopping the Cowboys' Ezekiel Elliott, returning this week from a six-game suspension.  (Photo: Brandon Wade, AP) Dallas Cowboys (8-6) Remaining games : vs. Seahawks, at Eagles Outlook : See above. Dallas can realistically get to 10 wins, but the Cowboys need a lot to go right to make the playoffs. Currently, they have about a 5% chance to reach the postseason, according to FiveThirtyEight.com. There’s a better chance that Jerry Jones picks the next commissioner. Detroit Lions (8-6) Remaining games : at Bengals, vs. Packers Outlook : They know the deal by now, even if they won't admit it. Bottom line: Win out, and hope one of those NFC South teams goes cold. Contact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.

(Photo: Jason Behnken, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 27 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Free Press sports writer Carlos Monarrez answers three questions after the Detroit Lions' 24-21 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday in Tampa, Fla. Should the Lions get credit for staying alive in playoff race? Yes, but not much. Jim Caldwell and the Lions survived another week. But this dismal effort against one of the NFL’s worst teams tells you all you need to know about the Lions’ chances for making the playoffs and — if a minor miracle happens — how little you could expect them to do in the playoffs. The Lions looked bad against a horrible team. Once again, they couldn’t run the ball, Matthew Stafford threw two interceptions and they made mental mistakes at key moments. But mostly, they looked inept and the offense struggled to take advantage of five takeaways by the defense. What do you make of Caldwell’s contract extension reportedly being 1 year? The Lions bungled this from the start . If it’s true, the Lions hedged their bets big time on Caldwell with absolutely no discernible advantage. They really haven’t kept him from being a lame duck and they didn’t reap any of the benefits of announcing loudly and proudly that they stand behind Caldwell with a 100-percent commitment. They have managed this situation with the most sheepish, guarded posture possible. Whatever the Lions say shouldn’t matter. Caldwell was brought to Detroit four years ago to win a championship and they are no closer to doing that now than they were in 2014. ►More: Jim Caldwell on hot seat; extension reportedly only 1 year ►Jeff Seidel: Lions' woes fall on GM Bob Quinn just as much as Caldwell What are Lions’ chances to make playoffs? Honestly, I think they have a good chance because of their favorable schedule. If they can beat the Bears at home Saturday, they have a good shot of winning out. The Bengals looked terrible Sunday in a 33-7 loss to Chicago. So, if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back for the Packers, the Lions might pull off the unthinkable and win out to finish 10-6. They’re going to need help from all the NFC South teams ahead of them, which will be hard because they’re all playing each other. But, as the Lions proved Sunday against the Bucs, they’re just good enough to beat bad teams. ►Seidel: These Lions looked ugly in win over Bucs Contact Carlos Monarrez: cmonarrez@freepress.com.

(Photo: Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE CINCINNATI — By now you know the drill: The Lions need to win their final two games, starting today against the Cincinnati Bengals, and get some help to make the playoffs . But as you make that last-minute trip to the mall or head over to the in-laws for some tasty Christmas Eve dinner, here are the games you need to keep an eye on today, and what needs to happen for the Lions to stay in the playoff chase. Lions (8-6) at Bengals (5-9), 1 p.m. OK, this is obvious. The Lions need to win in Cincinnati for the first time since 1992 in order to keep their playoff hopes alive. If they lose, they're out. If they tie, well, let's just say they'd need more help than they already do now. Root for: The Lions Falcons (9-5) at Saints (10-4), 1 p.m. The Lions' best chance to make the playoffs, assuming they win out, is for the Atlanta Falcons to lose their last two games against the Saints today and the Carolina Panthers next week. The defending NFC champs would finish 9-7 if that happened, and the Lions would get in with 10 wins. The Falcons beat the Saints two weeks ago, 20-17, but New Orleans has won six straight at home since losing to the New England Patriots in Week 2. Root for: The Saints Detroit Lions vs. Cincinnati Bengals: Scouting report, prediction Detroit Lions mailbag: How often do 10-win teams miss the playoffs? Buccaneers (4-10) at Panthers (10-4), 1 p.m. The Bucs have lost four straight and are riddled with injuries, but if they can pull off an upset in Carolina today it would greatly improve the Lions' chances of making the postseason. Atlanta and Carolina play next week, so a Panthers loss coupled with a Falcons loss would guarantee one team of finishing with a 10-6 record. The Lions still would need either the Cowboys or Seahawks to win out to win a multi-team tie-breaker with a team other than the Falcons (Atlanta owns all tie-breakers in that situation), but that could make for an interesting Week 17. Root for: The Bucs Seahawks (8-6) at Cowboys (8-6), 4;25 p.m. It really doesn't matter who wins this game, what matters for the Lions' playoff hopes is that whoever wins also wins next week. The Cowboys, who get Ezekiel Elliott back on the field, visit the Eagles next week, though Philadelphia could be resting its starters if it locks up homefield advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. The Seahawks host the Cardinals in what could be Arizona coach Bruce Arians' final game. Root for: Anything but a tie Contact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.

For one, it makes the Vikings path to a first-round bye much more manageable. The Vikings have to travel to Green Bay on Sunday, and you have to think that their chances of winning just shot up by about 5000 percent now that the Packers have decided to shut down Rodgers for the rest of the season. The other team that could end up feeling some playoff side effects from the Rodgers decision is the Dallas Cowboys . The Cowboys are already a long shot to make the postseason their odds just became slightly longer now that Rodgers has been place on IR. So what does Rodgers have to do with the Cowboys' playoff chances? Let's get to this week's playoff projection and find out. As always, we'll be including data from number-cruncher Stephen Oh of SportsLine.com in these projections. One more thing: If your team has already been eliminated from playoff contention and you don't want to read about the playoffs because reading about playoffs makes you sad, here's a link to a mock draft that you can read instead . On the other hand, if you're a Bengals fan and you're more concerned about who your next coach might than with mock drafts, then you can check out this list of potential candidates .    The Bengals were one of four teams who were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 15 along with the Jets , Packers and Cardinals . Those four now join the Buccaneers , Texans , Colts , Broncos , Redskins , Browns , 49ers, Bears and Giants , who all managed to get eliminated earlier in the season. Note: Remember, this is a projection based on how we think the regular season will play out. If you want to see the current playoff standings, click here to see Will Brinson's thorough breakdown of what the playoff race looks like as we head into Week 16. AFC Playoff Projection ( Team, projected record after 16 games, strength of schedule listed if in top-five easiest or hardest ) 1. Patriots (13-3), AFC East champion: With the Steelers out of the way, the Jets and the Bills are now the only things standing in-between the Patriots and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. As you can see from our projection, we have zero faith in either team stopping the Patriots from getting the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC.    Remaining schedule: Buffalo (8-6), at N.Y. Jets (5-9) 2. Steelers (13-3), AFC North champion: The Steelers loss to New England might have cost them any chance at the Super Bowl . With the Patriots likely getting home-field advantage in the playoffs now, that's bad news for the Steelers because they've NEVER beaten Tom Brady in Foxborough (0-5, including the postseason). Remaining schedule: At Houston (4-10), Cleveland (0-14) -- Easiest remaining schedule 3. Jaguars (12-4), AFC South champion: Besides the Steelers, the biggest loser after Sunday's controversial "catch rule" game in Pittsburgh was definitely the Jaguars. Due to the Patriots win, the Jaguars now have almost no chance of earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. Their best chance is to have the Steelers slip-up in one of their final two games, but the Jags should probably stop fantasizing about that because Pittsburgh plays Cleveland and Houston over the final two weeks. The good news for the Jags is that with just one more win, they'll guarantee that they finish the season with at least a three-seed in the AFC. Remaining schedule: At San Francisco (4-10), at Tennessee (6-8) 4. Chiefs (10-6) AFC West champion: With one more win this season, the Chiefs will officially clinch the AFC West and then they can officially start pretending that 1-6 midseason meltdown never happened. With only the Dolphins and Broncos left on their schedule, we really like their chances of getting that one more win. The only way for the Chiefs NOT to win the division would be if they lost out and the Chargers won out. The computer doesn't think that's going to happen. According to SportsLine, the Chargers have just a 2.2 percent chance of winning the AFC West.    Remaining schedule: Miami (6-8), at Denver (5-9) 5. Ravens (10-6), wild card: The rest of the AFC should be rooting against the Ravens over the next two weeks because the one guy who could throw a wrench into the playoffs is "January Joe." Although regular season Joe Flacco hasn't been elite for two or three years now, January Joe is always elite. Flacco has been to the playoffs a total of six times in his career and he's won at least one game in each of those six trips. Remaining schedule: Indianapolis (3-11), Cincinnati (5-9) -- Third easiest remaining schedule 6. Chargers (9-7), AFC wild card: If the Chargers don't have DirecTV's Sunday Ticket, they might want to get it for the final two weeks of the season because they're going to want to pay attention to what's going on in Tennessee. If the Titans win either one of the their final two games -- against Jacksonville and the Rams -- then that will almost certainly knock the Chargers out of this spot.  Remaining schedule: At N.Y. Jets (5-9), Oakland (6-8) Tiebreakers: In our projection, the Patriots win the tiebreaker for the No. 1 seed based on a head-to-head win over the Steelers and the Chargers get the final wild-card spot based on their head-to-head win over the Bills.    Just missed Bills (9-7): Remember when Bills coach Sean McDermott inexplicably decided to bench Tyrod Taylor and start rookie Nathan Peterman back in Week 11? Based on our projection, that might go down as the worst quarterback decision of all-time because it could end up costing the Bills a playoff spot. Although we have the Bills tying the Chargers for the AFC's final wild-card spot, the playoff berth will be going to L.A. because they hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over Buffalo and yup, that win came when Peterman started. The Chargers victory came back in Week 11 when Peterman threw five interceptions in the first half of a 54-24 Buffalo loss.  Note: If the Chargers, Ravens and Bills all finished in 9-7, the Bills would be in and the Chargers would be the odd team out. Remaining schedule: At New England (11-3), at Miami (6-8) Titans (8-8): Although we've completely given up on the Titans chances of getting to the playoffs, the computer is still Tennessee's No. 1 fan. According to Sportsline, the Titans are currently the statistical favorite to land the final wild-card spot in the AFC. The computer says that Tennessee has a 69.6 percent of making the postseason, which is way higher than the Bills (40.5 percent) and Chargers (14.3 percent) combined. Remaining schedule: L.A. Rams (10-4), Jacksonville (10-4) -- Tied for most difficult schedule    NFC Playoff Projection ( Team, projected record after 16 games ) 1. Eagles (13-3), NFC East champion: The final week of the season could basically turn into a bye for the Eagles if they can beat the Raiders on Sunday. A win over Oakland would clinch home-field advantage for Philly, which means coach Doug Pederson could rest his starters in Week 17. The Cowboys would probably appreciate that a lot because they could be playing for a playoff berth at that point. Remaining schedule: Oakland (6-8), Dallas (8-6) 2. Vikings (13-3), NFC North champion: The Packers gave the Vikings an early Christmas present this week by shutting Aaron Rodgers down for the season. Now, instead of getting a quarterback who probably would've been out for revenge, the Vikings are going to face a quarterback ( Brett Hundley ) who will likely be eaten alive by Minnesota's defense. With Rodgers out, the Vikings should coast to 13-3. Of course, the Vikings could also fall all the way to the fourth seed if they were to lose out, but we don't see that happening. Remaining schedule: At Green Bay (7-7), Chicago (4-10) 3. Rams (12-4), wild card: Two big droughts could be coming to an end if the Rams can beat the Titans this week. A win over Tennessee would clinch the Rams' first playoff berth since 2004 and their first division title since 2003. According to the computer, it's probably OK to go ahead and pop the champagne corks now, Rams fans. SportsLine says the Seahawks only have a 3.2 percent chance of winning the division, which means we're almost at the point where it would be mathematically impossible for the Rams to blow it. Don't give champagne to the computer though because computers don't like champagne. Remaining schedule: At Tennessee (8-6), San Francisco (4-10) 4. Saints (12-4), NFC South champion: Although we don't always see eye-to-eye with the computer, we do agree with it on how the NFC South is going to shake out this year. According to SportsLine, the Saints (64.1 percent) have the best chance of winning the division, followed by the Panthers (25.4 percent) and Falcons (10.5 percent). The Saints can actually wrap up the NFC South as soon as Sunday if they beat the Falcons.    Remaining schedule: Atlanta (9-5), at Tampa Bay (4-10) 5. Panthers (11-5), wild card: To clinch a playoff spot this week, all the Panthers have to do is beat a Buccaneers team that will be playing on the road on a short week, so we're going to go ahead and write them into the postseason with a sharpie marker. Of course, there is one huge downside to potentially getting the fifth seed in the NFC, if that happens, there's a good chance the Panthers will have to open the postseason against a Saints team that swept them this year. Remaining schedule: Tampa Bay (4-10), at Atlanta (9-5) 6. Falcons  (10-6), wild card: The good news for the Falcons is that they control their own playoff fate: To earn a spot in the postseason, all they have to do is win one of their final two games. Of course, there's also some bad news here and that news it that they have the hardest remaining schedule in the NFL , so winning just one of their final two games won't be easy. We're projecting the Falcons here because there's a good chance the Panthers won't have anything to play for in Week 17, which means Carolina could decide to rest some of its starters. Remaining schedule: At New Orleans (10-4), Carolina (10-4) -- Tied for most difficult schedule Tiebreakers: In our projection, the Eagles get the top seed over the Vikings based on best winning percentage in common games. The Rams get the three-seed over the Saints based on a head-to-head win and the Falcons get the final wild card spot over Dallas and Detroit because they beat both teams during the regular season.    Just missed Cowboys (10-6): The Packers decision to shut down Aaron Rodgers for the rest of the season doesn't just affect the Packers, it could also affect the Cowboys. For the Cowboys to get into the postseason, three big things have to happen: Cowboys win out Falcons lose out (at New Orleans, vs. Carolina) Lions go 1-1 (at Cincinnati, vs. Green Bay) With the Panthers (10-4) and Saints (10-4) still on their schedule, it wouldn't be completely crazy to see the Falcons lose their final two games. At that point, a potential 10-6 Cowboys team would need the Lions to lose one of their final two games, which seemed completely plausible as recently as Monday because the Lions close their season against the Packers. If Rodgers was playing, well, let's just say no one's picking the Lions in that game. With Rodgers out though, the Lions will almost certainly be the favorite to win that game on Dec. 31. If the Lions go 2-0 to end the season and end up in a 10-6 tie with the Cowboys -- but not the Falcons, who would finish 9-7 in this scenario -- Detroit would get the NFC's final playoff spot due to winning the "best winning percentage in common games" tiebreaker. Although the scenario listed is the most plausible one for the Cowboys to get to the playoffs, there are three other possible ways Dallas can get in, which you can check out by clicking here .    Remaining schedule: Seahawks (8-6), Eagles (12-2) -- Tied for most difficult schedule Lions (10-6): If the Lions miss the playoffs, they're probably going to want to put a lump of coal in the stocking of NFL replay official Alberto Riveron. Back in Week 3 against the Falcons, Golden Tate appeared to score a touchdown with just eight seconds left that would've won the game.  Super slow-mo of the Tate TD. You can make an argument he doesn't have complete control of the ball until he crosses goal line pic.twitter.com/MDrYrjvp6w — Isaac (@WorldofIsaac) September 24, 2017   However, the Lions didn't win because the touchdown was overturned after a review by Riveron. Including that 30-26 loss to Atlanta, three of the Lions six losses through 15 weeks have been by five or fewer points. If the Lions would've won just one of those games, we'd likely be projecting them into the playoffs. Even the computer has written Detroit off: According to SportsLine, the Lions have just a 7.5 percent chance of making the postseason.

Detroit News Matthew Stafford (Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 29 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Detroit Lions (8-6) need to win their final two games to have a shot at making the playoffs. Here are the possibilities: Scenario 1: Atlanta (9-5) loses its final two games. And there’s a realistic possibility of this happening with the two foes in the mix for the NFC South crown. The Lions could end up tied with the Seahawks (8-6), Rams (10-4) or Cowboys (8-6) for the final spot, but would hold tiebreakers over all three. If the Rams lose their next two, the Lions would finish with a better conference record, the second tie-breaker after head-to-head. Detroit would have the same conference record as Seattle and Dallas. Moving to the next tiebreaker, common games, Detroit holds the advantage over both, having gone 4-1. There’s no way for Detroit to jump Atlanta, which holds head-to-head tiebreakers with Dallas and Seattle, and potentially New Orleans. Atlanta holds a two-game lead in conference record. Scenario 2: The remaining ways the Lions get in are all multi-team, tiebreaking scenarios. The Panthers would have to lose their final two games in this scenario and would be eliminated in the tiebreaker because of the worse conference record. It would then go to the teams’ common games, where the Lions beat the Seahawks and Cowboys. Scenario 3: The other NFC South possibility is the Saints lose out with the Cowboys/Seahawks winning out. Losing out would give the Saints five conference loses, eliminating them. Again, it goes to common games, where the Lions win out. Scenario 4: Any four- or five-team tie between Carolina/Seattle/ Dallas/New Orleans/Los Angeles/Detroit finishing 10-6 would result in Detroit making the playoffs.

return to playoffs in 2017                     John Buhler/Fansided         Jun 30, 2017 at 10:28p ET                       0 Shares         While the Detroit Lions lost their NFC Wild Card game to the Seattle Seahawks, here are five reasons that they will be back in the 2017 NFC Playoffs.  The 2016 Detroit Lions season came to an end on Saturday night, as they lost their NFC Wild Card game on the road to the Seattle Seahawks 26-6. Detroit stumbled down the stretch, but still managed to make the NFC Playoffs for the second time in three seasons.  Article continues below ...  Because both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Washington Redskins lost crucial games in the final weeks of the 2016 regular season, Detroit was able get in the NFC Playoffs as the No. 6 seed at 9-7 on the year.  Many didn’t believe in the Lions in 2016, but they did have their moments this fall. Entering 2016, the Lions were probably a year away from contending for a playoff spot in the NFC anyway. Overall, this team exceeded expectations and had a great year nevertheless. Here are five reasons the Lions making the NFC Playoffs wasn’t a fluke and they’ll be back in 2017.    5. Navigable 2017 season schedule  Because the Lions didn’t win the NFC North –that would be the Green Bay Packers– Detroit won’t play a first-place schedule in 2017. That absolutely helps their cause in getting back to the NFC Playoffs.  Instead of drawing teams like the Seahawks and the Dallas Cowboys next season, Detroit gets a bit of an easier draw in competitive balance, landing the Arizona Cardinals and the New York Giants as their other two games.  As for the 14 games that Detroit already knew it was going to play well in advance of 2017, the Lions will get the NFC South, the AFC North and its annual six division games. The NFC South usually has one dominant team, one playoff pretender and two teams that don’t know what they’re doing.  In the AFC North, the Pittsburgh Steelers are strong, but the Baltimore Ravens are inconsistent, the Cincinnati Bengals might be rebuilding, and then there is science experiment gone wrong known as the Cleveland Browns.  The NFC North probably has two playoff teams next season, including Detroit. It could be either the Packers or the Minnesota Vikings. The Chicago Bears are probably hapless for the foreseeable future in a clueless rebuild.  Next: 4. They already know how to win close games    Nov 6, 2016; Minneapolis, MN, USA; Detroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate (15) beats Minnesota Vikings free safety Harrison Smith (22) and scores a touchdown to win the game at U.S. Bank Stadium.

They already know how to win close games Some will try to deconstruct the Lions’ nine regular season wins as being mostly the beneficiaries of either-or games. The Lions played in an absurd number of close games in 2016, most decided by seven points or less. While some could argue that the Lions were a 6-10 team masquerading as a 9-7 team, they did find a way to win these tight ball games and that matters. When games were tight, the Lions managed to play loose and grab the victory for the taking. There are four reasons for this that cannot be understated: 1.) Quarterback Matthew Stafford is a maestro in fourth-quarter comebacks and game-winning drives. 2.) Kicker Matt Prater will make the 50-yard field goal under intense pressure. 3.) The defense doesn’t collapse late in games under defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. 4. ) Head coach Jim Caldwell’s stoic demeanor only aids in the Lions being cool under pressure. The Lions may lose games in blowouts in 2017, but there seems to be too much good in how they conduct themselves in winning time for that to disappear after this season; call it the clutch gene or just being prepared. Lesser teams can’t deliver in those situations. Expect the Lions to win about five of those games next season. It’s in their DNA. Next: 3. A lot to like with this coaching staff   Nov 20, 2016; Detroit, MI, USA; Detroit Lions head coach Jim Caldwell looks on during the fourth quarter against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Ford Field. Lions won 26-19. Mandatory Credit: Raj Mehta-USA TODAY Sports  3. A lot to like with this coaching staff This is something that tends to get overlooked. The Lions have themselves a solid coaching staff with a proven head coach in Jim Caldwell and two strong coordinators in offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter and defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. Together, they give the Lions balance and a foundation that can breed success. Austin will eventually be an NFL head coach one day. He is adept at generating a pass rush and is starting to get some great play from his secondary. Detroit can get better against the run, but Austin’s defense was a major reason the Lions played in and won so many close games. Forget about his interesting name because Cooter can flat-out coach the quarterback position. Since taking over mid-season in 2015 as offensive coordinator we’ve seen Stafford become the best version of himself as an NFL passer. They have a great rapport and had some great success in the experimental offense this season. Detroit lacked high-profile weapons, a consistent running game and a busted Stafford finger to work around. Stafford and Cooter can grow together for the foreseeable future. Caldwell’s even keel allows the Lions to not get too high or too low. He knows his offensive personnel and is aware enough to surround himself with solid defensive coaches. Whether or not this is intentional, Caldwell and his staff are cultivating a Lions team that can thrive in on-field chaos. Playoff teams do that weekly. Next: 2. Matthew Stafford is in his prime   January 7, 2017; Seattle, WA, USA; Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford (9) throws against the Seattle Seahawks during the first half in the NFC Wild Card playoff football game at CenturyLink Field. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports  2. Matthew Stafford is in his prime It finally happened. 2016 was the coming out year for Lions starting quarterback Matthew Stafford. For a good part of the season, Stafford was a serious candidate for NFL MVP. He had this never-say-die mentality to playing quarterback for the Lions in so many of those fourth-quarter comebacks. Playing quarterback for a losing culture has not been easy for the former No. 1 overall pick out of the University of Georgia. He’s had unbelievable talent at the position, but long needed the stability around him to succeed. Stafford has found that with Caldwell at head coach and Cooter at offensive coordinator. Keep in mind that Stafford had his best season in his first year without Calvin Johnson, who retired from the NFL after nine seasons. Undoubtedly, the Lions became Stafford’s team after Johnson’s retirement. Stafford played unencumbered until suffering ligament damage to his middle finger on his throwing hand. That injury derail his and the Lions’ season in December, but he’s very much in his prime as a professional. As he approaches 30, Stafford should stay at this upper echelon of quarterbacking until his mid-30s. He has the arm talent that probably will never wane. For the first time since he played at Georgia, Stafford doesn’t seem to be burdened playing quarterback in Detroit. He’s already the best quarterback in franchise history. Look for him to take that next step in 2017 and be a serious MVP candidate into late December 2017. Next: 1. Bob Quinn is just getting started   Feb 24, 2016; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Detroit Lions general manager Bob Quinn speaks to the media during the 2016 NFL Scouting Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports  1. Bob Quinn is just getting started Detroit may have a navigable schedule, know how to win close games, have a solid coaching staff, and a star quarterback, but easily the biggest reason that the Lions will make the NFC Playoffs again in 2017 is that they have a strong architect in place in general manager Bob Quinn. He’s just getting started. The Lions were able to pry Quinn away from the New England Patriots in 2016 after being the director of pro scouting the last several years. This means that Quinn will be able to nail NFL drafts for the foreseeable future in Detroit. His connection to New England and seeing the Lions have success in his first year on the job means that Detroit could be a viable team in 2017 NFL free agency. Detroit will have roughly $41 million in salary cap room to make a few big splashes in free agency. The foundation looks promising in Detroit, as the Lions have built well through the draft. Next: NFL Power Rankings: 30 Best QB of All-Time Expect Quinn to consult Caldwell, Cooter, and Austin about which role players would best fit their team. A few minor tweaks to the Lions roster in free agency and another solid NFL Draft could definitely be enough to get the Lions back into the NFC Playoffs. It’s amazing what stability can do to an organization.

This week’s Monday Countdown is a five-course offering thrown together from the leftovers of the Detroit Lions’ 30-23 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thanksgiving Day.  In short, it’s a look at the possibility of the Lions making the playoffs, either by winning the NFC North (remote) or as a wild card (not good, either).  With five games left, the obstacles in the Lions’ path of reaching the postseason for the third time in four seasons under head coach Jim Caldwell are obvious.  They trail the first-place Vikings by three games in what a week ago was a two-team race for the North title and now looks like a runaway.  And in terms of the wild card, they are behind in won-loss records and tiebreakers because of losses to the Saints, Falcons and Panthers of the NFC South.  We start with the Lions’ chances:  1. Where the Lions stand: Losing to the Vikings kept them in second place in the North with a 6-5 record, but three games back of the Vikings when a win could have cut the margin to one game.  “If you’re around .500 a little bit before when you’re sitting down for your Thanksgiving meal, you’ve still got a chance,” Caldwell said after the game, repeating something he said he once heard.  “We’ve got a lot of football yet to play, and you don’t know what’s going to happen,” Caldwell said. “There’s other games that are being played too. I know the media will paint it like the sky is falling, but the sky is not falling for us.  “We’ve got to get ourselves a little bit better and keep moving forward.”  If you’re a head coach, you look ahead through the gloom of a crippling loss to the rays of hope.  One man’s opinion: It’s a long-shot hope because of the NFC’s crowded field of playoff contenders, but it isn’t no shot.  With a 6-5 won-loss record and five games left, the Lions have a chance to make the playoffs. To do that, they have to keep winning on the road, where they’re 4-1, and start winning at home, where they’re 2-4.  2. North race: It’s not over, but the Vikings look like the class of the division, and not just because of the numbers – a 9-2 record and three-game lead on the Lions.  The way they handled the Lions on Thanksgiving Day was impressive. In a pivotal game, they played like champs.  There wasn’t an area on offense or defense where the Lions had the advantage. The Vikings ran the ball better. They rushed the passer better. And for one game, Case Keenum had a better game than Matthew Stafford .  Vikings bottom line: With a seven-game winning streak, the Vikings show no signs of putting on the brakes. Their next two games are on the road against Atlanta and Carolina, but the final three aren’t nearly as tough – home against Cincinnati, at Green Bay and home against the Bears.  Don’t crown the Vikings yet, but the prospect of them playing the Super Bowl in their home stadium is not as far-fetched as it seemed at the start of the season.  3. Vikings flop, 2016: A three-game deficit with five left leaves a lot for the Lions to make up. But recent history shows that it’s possible.  The Vikings started 5-0 last season, while the Lions were three games behind at 2-3. The Vikings lost the next four games and were 6-4 after 10 games. The Lions went 4-1 and were 6-4 after 10 games.  The Lions went on to make the playoffs as a wild card at 9-7. The Vikings continued their skid to 8-8 and out of the postseason.  Bottom line: A similar fade like last season is unlikely. For one thing, the Vikings already are at nine wins. For another, they’re playing better ball than last year, and the Lions are the only other legitimate contenders.  The Lions and Packers both were contenders last year, and the Packers rallied to win the North by beating the Lions in a final-game showdown at Ford Field. With Aaron Rodgers currently out with a broken collarbone, the chance of another Packers comeback is remote.  4.  10 for the show: Again, based on recent history 10 wins are the minimum to make the NFC playoffs as a wild card. Only once in the previous seven seasons – from 2010-2016 – has a team made the NFC field as a wild card with a record of 9-7.  The exception: The 2016 Detroit Lions, who got in at 9-7.  In four of the last seven seasons, 10 wins did not qualify as a wild card. In 2010 the Giants and Bucs sat home at 10-6. Same for the Bears in 2012, the Cardinals in 2013 and the Eagles in 2014.  Bottom line: Win 10 games, you might get in. Win 11, you will. Win nine, stay at home.  5.  The schedule: Some teams above the Lions might sink in the standings. Some below might rise up. The Lions have to focus on their business and let the rest of us watch the schedule and make projections.  Three of the Lions last five games are on the road, against the Ravens, Bucs and Bengals. The two at home are against the Bears and Packers, teams the Lions already have beaten on the road, and teams the Lions should beat again at Ford Field, regardless of their 2-4 home record this season.  Predicting a five-game winning streak for the Lions is a flight of fancy, but picking them to win any of the five games from week to week is legitimate.  Bottom line: Improbable does not mean impossible, but the Lions have dug their way into a hole. They need help to climb out.

Either way, they have about a coin flip's chance of making the postseason. ( Mike Mulholland | MLive.com )      Comment       By Kyle Meinke  kmeinke@mlive.com       ALLEN PARK -- The Detroit Lions haven't won a division title since they took the old NFC Central in 1993. And it's probably not going to happen this year, either.  Football Outsiders, an advanced analytics site, has pegged Detroit's chances of winning the NFC North at 15.7 percent. Minnesota (8-2) is the runaway favorite at 83.4 percent, while Green Bay (5-5) somehow still clings to a 1 percent chance despite losing four of their last five games (not to mention their quarterback).  Of course, the Lions (6-4) could make things really interesting by knocking off Minnesota in their divisional showdown Thursday at Ford Field. The Vikings have won six straight to open a two-game lead, but Detroit already has a win in hand in the series.  With another win, the Lions would trim the lead to one with five to go. They'd hold the head-to-head tiebreaker, too, while also facing the easier schedule. They still have road trips to face Baltimore, Tampa and Cincinnati, plus home games against Chicago and Green Bay. None of those teams has a winning record.  The Vikings, meantime, head to Detroit, Atlanta and Carolina the next three weeks in a row. And after hosting Cincinnati, they are back on the road in Green Bay before wrapping up the season against Chicago.  Even if the Lions can't catch Minnesota, their chances of making the postseason are still 49.4 percent according to Football Outsiders. That's sixth best in the NFC.  Here are their chances by seed: 1: 0.1 percent 2: 0.9 percent 3: 7.3 percent 4: 7.4 percent 5: 10.5 percent 6: 23.2 percent Out: 50.6 percent     View Comments                  About Us    MLive Media Group    Our Team    Advertise    Frequently Asked Questions      Contact Us    Jobs at MLive      Subscriptions    Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters    The Ann Arbor News    The Bay City Times    The Flint Journal    The Grand Rapids Press    Jackson Citizen Patriot    Kalamazoo Gazette    Muskegon Chronicle    The Saginaw News        MLive Sections    News    Business    Sports    High School Sports    Entertainment    Living    Opinion    Obituaries      Jobs    Autos    Real Estate    Apartment Rentals    Classifieds    Local Deals    Local Businesses    Business Resource Center      Your Regional News Pages    Ann Arbor    Bay City    Detroit    Flint    Grand Rapids      Jackson    Kalamazoo    Lansing    Muskegon    Saginaw      Mobile    Mobile apps | Tablet apps        More on MLive    Photos    Video    Weather    Post a job      Post a free classified ad    Sell your car    Sell/Rent your home    Apartments and Rentals    Sponsor Content      Follow Us    Twitter | Facebook | YouTube        Advance Local  Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy   © 2018 MLive Media Group.

And as the Lions get ready for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals, they still need lots of help to join the fun. The Atlanta Falcons moved a game closer to a playoff spot with a win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night. Already two NFC teams, the Eagles and Vikings, have locked up their divisions, and four more teams — the Falcons, Saints, Panthers and Rams — can clinch a spot with another win. The Lions’ playoff odds currently stand at 14%, according to FiveThirtyEight.com . They’ll be eliminated from postseason contention with their next loss, and since the Saints and Falcons meet in a win-and-in game this week (and the Falcons and Panthers play in Week 17), there are only a few scenarios in which they can get a wild card. Here, with the help of FiveThirtyEight’s prediction machine, are the realistic possibilities. (The Lions can make the playoffs with a win and a tie, but the likelihood of that happening is miniscule and thus not included in this breakdown.) Scenario 1: Lions win out, Falcons lose out The Lions would finish 10-6, the Falcons 9-7, and the Lions would be in, likely as the six seed. Either the Seahawks or Cowboys — they play each other on Sunday — also can finish with 10 wins, but the Lions own the tiebreaker over both. If by chance the Seahawks also win out, and the Rams lose their final two games, the Seahawks would win the NFC West and the Lions would win a tiebreaker with L.A. The Falcons (9-5) have two tough games left (at New Orleans, vs. Carolina), so while this is unlikely, it’s not totally improbable. Scenario 2: Lions win out, Saints lose out The Lions got drilled by the Saints in New Orleans and would lose a head-to-head tie-breaker if both teams finish with 10-6 records. However, the Lions would get in if there’s a three-team tie with the Saints and Cowboys or Seahawks, or a four-team tie with the Saints, Falcons and Cowboys or Seahawks. More Lions: Detroit Lions merely treading water in playoff chase despite victory Unacceptable for Lions' Jim Caldwell not to discuss division title failure Detroit Lions' Darius Slay might 'start a riot' if Pro Bowl denies him Head-to-head records only come into play if all tied teams have played each other, so the Lions would be eliminated if they finish in a three-way tie with any two other NFC South teams. In down-the-line tie-breakers like conference record and games against common opponents, the Lions fare well. Of course, the Saints (10-4) host Atlanta and play at Tampa Bay the next two weeks, so there’s a good chance they’ll get to at least 11 wins. Scenario 3: Lions win out, Panthers lose out Similar to Scenario 2, the Lions would lose a head-to-head tie-breaker with the Panthers if they are the only teams tied at 10-6 based on their Week 5 loss at Ford Field. If the Cowboys or Seahawks also win out to get to 10-6, the Lions would earn a wild card berth based on multi-team tie-breakers. The Panthers (10-4) host the Bucs and visit the Falcons the next two weeks, and they’ve won six of their past seven games. Scenario 4: Lions win out, Saints and Panthers lose out The same principles mentioned earlier apply here. If the Lions, Saints and Panthers are the only teams that finish with a 10-6 record, the Lions would miss the playoffs based on head-to-head results. If either the Cowboys or Seahawks also finish with 10 wins, both of the NFC South teams would miss the playoffs based on the NFL's tie-breaking procedures . The Lions could be the fifth seed in this scenario. Saints running back Alvin Kamara leaps over Lions cornerback Darius Slay during a game on Oct. 15, 2017 in New Orleans.  (Photo: Butch Dill, AP) Here's a closer look at the NFC wild card contenders New Orleans Saints (10-4) Remaining games : vs. Falcons, at Bucs Outlook : The Saints have lost two of their past four games, but get a chance to avenge one of those defeats this week against a Falcons team playing on short rest. There's a distinct chance they go 12-4, and in the playoffs they'll be a team no one wants to face. If they lose out, they leave the door open a crack for the Lions to make the playoffs. Carolina Panthers (10-4) Remaining games : vs. Bucs, at Falcons Outlook : The Panthers need one win to lock up a playoff spot, and they should get it this Sunday at home against a Tampa team that’s lost four straight. They still could win the NFC South and get a first-round bye, and if they lose out they’d win a two-team tiebreaker with the Lions based on head-to-head result, but lose a three-team tiebreaker based on conference record. Atlanta Falcons (9-5) Remaining games : at Saints, vs. Panthers Outlook : The Falcons have the toughest road left of the three NFC South playoff contenders, but they also have the best conference record if it comes into play in the case of tie-breakers. If the Falcons get one more win, they’ll be in the playoffs with a chance to defend their NFC title. Seattle Seahawks (8-6) Remaining games : at Cowboys, vs. Cardinals Outlook : The Seahawks and Cowboys play what’s essentially a playoff elimination game on Sunday. The winner still has a chance at a wildcard spot, the loser can start making plans for January. The Seahawks played their most uninspiring game of the season last week, and now they have to stop Ezekiel Elliott in his return from a six-game suspension. Seattle's defense will be faced with stopping the Cowboys' Ezekiel Elliott, returning this week from a six-game suspension.  (Photo: Brandon Wade, AP) Dallas Cowboys (8-6) Remaining games : vs. Seahawks, at Eagles Outlook : See above. Dallas can realistically get to 10 wins, but the Cowboys need a lot to go right to make the playoffs. Currently, they have about a 5% chance to reach the postseason, according to FiveThirtyEight.com. There’s a better chance that Jerry Jones picks the next commissioner. Detroit Lions (8-6) Remaining games : at Bengals, vs. Packers Outlook : They know the deal by now, even if they won't admit it. Bottom line: Win out, and hope one of those NFC South teams goes cold. Contact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.

Should the Lions get credit for staying alive in playoff race? Yes, but not much. Jim Caldwell and the Lions survived another week. But this dismal effort against one of the NFL’s worst teams tells you all you need to know about the Lions’ chances for making the playoffs and — if a minor miracle happens — how little you could expect them to do in the playoffs. The Lions looked bad against a horrible team. Once again, they couldn’t run the ball, Matthew Stafford threw two interceptions and they made mental mistakes at key moments. But mostly, they looked inept and the offense struggled to take advantage of five takeaways by the defense. What do you make of Caldwell’s contract extension reportedly being 1 year? The Lions bungled this from the start . If it’s true, the Lions hedged their bets big time on Caldwell with absolutely no discernible advantage. They really haven’t kept him from being a lame duck and they didn’t reap any of the benefits of announcing loudly and proudly that they stand behind Caldwell with a 100-percent commitment. They have managed this situation with the most sheepish, guarded posture possible. Whatever the Lions say shouldn’t matter. Caldwell was brought to Detroit four years ago to win a championship and they are no closer to doing that now than they were in 2014. ►More: Jim Caldwell on hot seat; extension reportedly only 1 year ►Jeff Seidel: Lions' woes fall on GM Bob Quinn just as much as Caldwell What are Lions’ chances to make playoffs? Honestly, I think they have a good chance because of their favorable schedule. If they can beat the Bears at home Saturday, they have a good shot of winning out. The Bengals looked terrible Sunday in a 33-7 loss to Chicago. So, if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back for the Packers, the Lions might pull off the unthinkable and win out to finish 10-6. They’re going to need help from all the NFC South teams ahead of them, which will be hard because they’re all playing each other. But, as the Lions proved Sunday against the Bucs, they’re just good enough to beat bad teams. ►Seidel: These Lions looked ugly in win over Bucs Contact Carlos Monarrez: cmonarrez@freepress.com.

(Photo: Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE CINCINNATI — By now you know the drill: The Lions need to win their final two games, starting today against the Cincinnati Bengals, and get some help to make the playoffs . But as you make that last-minute trip to the mall or head over to the in-laws for some tasty Christmas Eve dinner, here are the games you need to keep an eye on today, and what needs to happen for the Lions to stay in the playoff chase. Lions (8-6) at Bengals (5-9), 1 p.m. OK, this is obvious. The Lions need to win in Cincinnati for the first time since 1992 in order to keep their playoff hopes alive. If they lose, they're out. If they tie, well, let's just say they'd need more help than they already do now. Root for: The Lions Falcons (9-5) at Saints (10-4), 1 p.m. The Lions' best chance to make the playoffs, assuming they win out, is for the Atlanta Falcons to lose their last two games against the Saints today and the Carolina Panthers next week. The defending NFC champs would finish 9-7 if that happened, and the Lions would get in with 10 wins. The Falcons beat the Saints two weeks ago, 20-17, but New Orleans has won six straight at home since losing to the New England Patriots in Week 2. Root for: The Saints Detroit Lions vs. Cincinnati Bengals: Scouting report, prediction Detroit Lions mailbag: How often do 10-win teams miss the playoffs? Buccaneers (4-10) at Panthers (10-4), 1 p.m. The Bucs have lost four straight and are riddled with injuries, but if they can pull off an upset in Carolina today it would greatly improve the Lions' chances of making the postseason. Atlanta and Carolina play next week, so a Panthers loss coupled with a Falcons loss would guarantee one team of finishing with a 10-6 record. The Lions still would need either the Cowboys or Seahawks to win out to win a multi-team tie-breaker with a team other than the Falcons (Atlanta owns all tie-breakers in that situation), but that could make for an interesting Week 17. Root for: The Bucs Seahawks (8-6) at Cowboys (8-6), 4;25 p.m. It really doesn't matter who wins this game, what matters for the Lions' playoff hopes is that whoever wins also wins next week. The Cowboys, who get Ezekiel Elliott back on the field, visit the Eagles next week, though Philadelphia could be resting its starters if it locks up homefield advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. The Seahawks host the Cardinals in what could be Arizona coach Bruce Arians' final game. Root for: Anything but a tie Contact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.

For one, it makes the Vikings path to a first-round bye much more manageable. The Vikings have to travel to Green Bay on Sunday, and you have to think that their chances of winning just shot up by about 5000 percent now that the Packers have decided to shut down Rodgers for the rest of the season. The other team that could end up feeling some playoff side effects from the Rodgers decision is the Dallas Cowboys . The Cowboys are already a long shot to make the postseason their odds just became slightly longer now that Rodgers has been place on IR. So what does Rodgers have to do with the Cowboys' playoff chances? Let's get to this week's playoff projection and find out. As always, we'll be including data from number-cruncher Stephen Oh of SportsLine.com in these projections. One more thing: If your team has already been eliminated from playoff contention and you don't want to read about the playoffs because reading about playoffs makes you sad, here's a link to a mock draft that you can read instead . On the other hand, if you're a Bengals fan and you're more concerned about who your next coach might than with mock drafts, then you can check out this list of potential candidates .    The Bengals were one of four teams who were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 15 along with the Jets , Packers and Cardinals . Those four now join the Buccaneers , Texans , Colts , Broncos , Redskins , Browns , 49ers, Bears and Giants , who all managed to get eliminated earlier in the season. Note: Remember, this is a projection based on how we think the regular season will play out. If you want to see the current playoff standings, click here to see Will Brinson's thorough breakdown of what the playoff race looks like as we head into Week 16. AFC Playoff Projection ( Team, projected record after 16 games, strength of schedule listed if in top-five easiest or hardest ) 1. Patriots (13-3), AFC East champion: With the Steelers out of the way, the Jets and the Bills are now the only things standing in-between the Patriots and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. As you can see from our projection, we have zero faith in either team stopping the Patriots from getting the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC.    Remaining schedule: Buffalo (8-6), at N.Y. Jets (5-9) 2. Steelers (13-3), AFC North champion: The Steelers loss to New England might have cost them any chance at the Super Bowl . With the Patriots likely getting home-field advantage in the playoffs now, that's bad news for the Steelers because they've NEVER beaten Tom Brady in Foxborough (0-5, including the postseason). Remaining schedule: At Houston (4-10), Cleveland (0-14) -- Easiest remaining schedule 3. Jaguars (12-4), AFC South champion: Besides the Steelers, the biggest loser after Sunday's controversial "catch rule" game in Pittsburgh was definitely the Jaguars. Due to the Patriots win, the Jaguars now have almost no chance of earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. Their best chance is to have the Steelers slip-up in one of their final two games, but the Jags should probably stop fantasizing about that because Pittsburgh plays Cleveland and Houston over the final two weeks. The good news for the Jags is that with just one more win, they'll guarantee that they finish the season with at least a three-seed in the AFC. Remaining schedule: At San Francisco (4-10), at Tennessee (6-8) 4. Chiefs (10-6) AFC West champion: With one more win this season, the Chiefs will officially clinch the AFC West and then they can officially start pretending that 1-6 midseason meltdown never happened. With only the Dolphins and Broncos left on their schedule, we really like their chances of getting that one more win. The only way for the Chiefs NOT to win the division would be if they lost out and the Chargers won out. The computer doesn't think that's going to happen. According to SportsLine, the Chargers have just a 2.2 percent chance of winning the AFC West.    Remaining schedule: Miami (6-8), at Denver (5-9) 5. Ravens (10-6), wild card: The rest of the AFC should be rooting against the Ravens over the next two weeks because the one guy who could throw a wrench into the playoffs is "January Joe." Although regular season Joe Flacco hasn't been elite for two or three years now, January Joe is always elite. Flacco has been to the playoffs a total of six times in his career and he's won at least one game in each of those six trips. Remaining schedule: Indianapolis (3-11), Cincinnati (5-9) -- Third easiest remaining schedule 6. Chargers (9-7), AFC wild card: If the Chargers don't have DirecTV's Sunday Ticket, they might want to get it for the final two weeks of the season because they're going to want to pay attention to what's going on in Tennessee. If the Titans win either one of the their final two games -- against Jacksonville and the Rams -- then that will almost certainly knock the Chargers out of this spot.  Remaining schedule: At N.Y. Jets (5-9), Oakland (6-8) Tiebreakers: In our projection, the Patriots win the tiebreaker for the No. 1 seed based on a head-to-head win over the Steelers and the Chargers get the final wild-card spot based on their head-to-head win over the Bills.    Just missed Bills (9-7): Remember when Bills coach Sean McDermott inexplicably decided to bench Tyrod Taylor and start rookie Nathan Peterman back in Week 11? Based on our projection, that might go down as the worst quarterback decision of all-time because it could end up costing the Bills a playoff spot. Although we have the Bills tying the Chargers for the AFC's final wild-card spot, the playoff berth will be going to L.A. because they hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over Buffalo and yup, that win came when Peterman started. The Chargers victory came back in Week 11 when Peterman threw five interceptions in the first half of a 54-24 Buffalo loss.  Note: If the Chargers, Ravens and Bills all finished in 9-7, the Bills would be in and the Chargers would be the odd team out. Remaining schedule: At New England (11-3), at Miami (6-8) Titans (8-8): Although we've completely given up on the Titans chances of getting to the playoffs, the computer is still Tennessee's No. 1 fan. According to Sportsline, the Titans are currently the statistical favorite to land the final wild-card spot in the AFC. The computer says that Tennessee has a 69.6 percent of making the postseason, which is way higher than the Bills (40.5 percent) and Chargers (14.3 percent) combined. Remaining schedule: L.A. Rams (10-4), Jacksonville (10-4) -- Tied for most difficult schedule    NFC Playoff Projection ( Team, projected record after 16 games ) 1. Eagles (13-3), NFC East champion: The final week of the season could basically turn into a bye for the Eagles if they can beat the Raiders on Sunday. A win over Oakland would clinch home-field advantage for Philly, which means coach Doug Pederson could rest his starters in Week 17. The Cowboys would probably appreciate that a lot because they could be playing for a playoff berth at that point. Remaining schedule: Oakland (6-8), Dallas (8-6) 2. Vikings (13-3), NFC North champion: The Packers gave the Vikings an early Christmas present this week by shutting Aaron Rodgers down for the season. Now, instead of getting a quarterback who probably would've been out for revenge, the Vikings are going to face a quarterback ( Brett Hundley ) who will likely be eaten alive by Minnesota's defense. With Rodgers out, the Vikings should coast to 13-3. Of course, the Vikings could also fall all the way to the fourth seed if they were to lose out, but we don't see that happening. Remaining schedule: At Green Bay (7-7), Chicago (4-10) 3. Rams (12-4), wild card: Two big droughts could be coming to an end if the Rams can beat the Titans this week. A win over Tennessee would clinch the Rams' first playoff berth since 2004 and their first division title since 2003. According to the computer, it's probably OK to go ahead and pop the champagne corks now, Rams fans. SportsLine says the Seahawks only have a 3.2 percent chance of winning the division, which means we're almost at the point where it would be mathematically impossible for the Rams to blow it. Don't give champagne to the computer though because computers don't like champagne. Remaining schedule: At Tennessee (8-6), San Francisco (4-10) 4. Saints (12-4), NFC South champion: Although we don't always see eye-to-eye with the computer, we do agree with it on how the NFC South is going to shake out this year. According to SportsLine, the Saints (64.1 percent) have the best chance of winning the division, followed by the Panthers (25.4 percent) and Falcons (10.5 percent). The Saints can actually wrap up the NFC South as soon as Sunday if they beat the Falcons.    Remaining schedule: Atlanta (9-5), at Tampa Bay (4-10) 5. Panthers (11-5), wild card: To clinch a playoff spot this week, all the Panthers have to do is beat a Buccaneers team that will be playing on the road on a short week, so we're going to go ahead and write them into the postseason with a sharpie marker. Of course, there is one huge downside to potentially getting the fifth seed in the NFC, if that happens, there's a good chance the Panthers will have to open the postseason against a Saints team that swept them this year. Remaining schedule: Tampa Bay (4-10), at Atlanta (9-5) 6. Falcons  (10-6), wild card: The good news for the Falcons is that they control their own playoff fate: To earn a spot in the postseason, all they have to do is win one of their final two games. Of course, there's also some bad news here and that news it that they have the hardest remaining schedule in the NFL , so winning just one of their final two games won't be easy. We're projecting the Falcons here because there's a good chance the Panthers won't have anything to play for in Week 17, which means Carolina could decide to rest some of its starters. Remaining schedule: At New Orleans (10-4), Carolina (10-4) -- Tied for most difficult schedule Tiebreakers: In our projection, the Eagles get the top seed over the Vikings based on best winning percentage in common games. The Rams get the three-seed over the Saints based on a head-to-head win and the Falcons get the final wild card spot over Dallas and Detroit because they beat both teams during the regular season.    Just missed Cowboys (10-6): The Packers decision to shut down Aaron Rodgers for the rest of the season doesn't just affect the Packers, it could also affect the Cowboys. For the Cowboys to get into the postseason, three big things have to happen: Cowboys win out Falcons lose out (at New Orleans, vs. Carolina) Lions go 1-1 (at Cincinnati, vs. Green Bay) With the Panthers (10-4) and Saints (10-4) still on their schedule, it wouldn't be completely crazy to see the Falcons lose their final two games. At that point, a potential 10-6 Cowboys team would need the Lions to lose one of their final two games, which seemed completely plausible as recently as Monday because the Lions close their season against the Packers. If Rodgers was playing, well, let's just say no one's picking the Lions in that game. With Rodgers out though, the Lions will almost certainly be the favorite to win that game on Dec. 31. If the Lions go 2-0 to end the season and end up in a 10-6 tie with the Cowboys -- but not the Falcons, who would finish 9-7 in this scenario -- Detroit would get the NFC's final playoff spot due to winning the "best winning percentage in common games" tiebreaker. Although the scenario listed is the most plausible one for the Cowboys to get to the playoffs, there are three other possible ways Dallas can get in, which you can check out by clicking here .    Remaining schedule: Seahawks (8-6), Eagles (12-2) -- Tied for most difficult schedule Lions (10-6): If the Lions miss the playoffs, they're probably going to want to put a lump of coal in the stocking of NFL replay official Alberto Riveron. Back in Week 3 against the Falcons, Golden Tate appeared to score a touchdown with just eight seconds left that would've won the game.  Super slow-mo of the Tate TD. You can make an argument he doesn't have complete control of the ball until he crosses goal line pic.twitter.com/MDrYrjvp6w — Isaac (@WorldofIsaac) September 24, 2017   However, the Lions didn't win because the touchdown was overturned after a review by Riveron. Including that 30-26 loss to Atlanta, three of the Lions six losses through 15 weeks have been by five or fewer points. If the Lions would've won just one of those games, we'd likely be projecting them into the playoffs. Even the computer has written Detroit off: According to SportsLine, the Lions have just a 7.5 percent chance of making the postseason. Remaining schedule: At Cincinnati (5-9), Green Bay (7-7) Wild-card round (Based on this week's projections) AFC (5) Baltimore at (4) Kansas City (6) L.A.
