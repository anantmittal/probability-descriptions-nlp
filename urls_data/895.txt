Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Visit our community    Can you really choose the sex of your baby? For as long as we've been making babies , women have been exchanging ideas about how to increase their chances of having either a boy or a girl. Unfortunately there's no medical evidence that any of them actually work!  Having said that, there'll always be a mum who tells you an old wives' tale worked for her. So if you fancy defying the experts and trying to tip the balance towards one sex yourself, why not try some of the suggestions below.   You're more likely to conceive a boy if... You have sex on the day of ovulation , as male sperm are thought to swim faster and reach the egg first. You reach orgasm before your partner, as this releases an alkaline fluid, thought to be more male-sperm friendly than the vagina's natural acidity. You have deep penetration during sex, such as from behind (doggie-style). Your partner has a high sperm count. This is because male sperm are not as strong as female sperm, and so the higher the count, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first. You avoid sex for a week before ovulation and then only have sex once on ovulation day, to keep the sperm count high. Your partner suggested the love-making. You make love at night. You make love on odd days of the month. Your partner keeps his genitals cool by wearing boxer shorts and loose-fitting trousers. You eat salty food, plenty of meat, fish, white flour, pasta, fresh fruit, certain vegetables, but avoid milk and dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, nuts, chocolate, shellfish and wholemeal bread. You're more likely to conceive a girl if... You have sex earlier on in your cycle, a few days before your day of ovulation. This is because female sperm are thought to be stronger and therefore last longer than male sperm, who will die off before reaching the egg. Your partner reaches orgasm before you. You have sex frequently to lower your partner's sperm count, and so increase the chances of the female sperm reaching the egg first. You keep penetration shallow. You stop having unprotected sex four to five days before ovulation, to minimise the chances of the male sperm reaching the egg first. Your partner keeps his genitals warm by wearing close-fitting underwear and tight trousers (although this isn't likely to do his general fertility any good!) You suggested the love-making. You make love in the afternoon. You make love on even days of the month. You put a wooden spoon under your bed and a pink ribbon under your pillow. You drink plenty of milk and eat dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, unsalted foods, rice, pasta, certain vegetables, mineral water, limited amounts of meat and potatoes, but avoid salt and any salty foods, wine and beer, fresh fruit, spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms, chocolate, coffee and tea.

I have two boys and have been blogging about wanting to have a girl for some time. I had gone through most of the experiences posted by women, like gender dieting, douching etc but they didn't really make any sense to me. Ultimately, I picked Urobiologics (based in the US) who have literally proven that, although gender is 'determined' by sperms, women select the gender of the baby based on the cycle she conceives, by choosing to conceive in the correct alternating cycle. We were given a conception plan to try to conceive in the girl cycle (you send off urine samples to Urobiologics, who will then determine when you will be in a boy or girl cycle). We became pregnant with our girl (we used their post-gender test to check the gender of the baby at around 7 weeks). Sadly our little Poppy girl died at 16 weeks (31 Oct) due to a PPROM, so we are leaving it a couple of months to heal and then go via the PreGender Preconception Test route again. I'm ready now!

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

But is that such a good thing? By Jeannette Moninger from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print An Eternal Quest         Jennifer Merrill Thompson was confident the baby she was carrying -- her second -- was a girl. After all, the mom from Vienna, Virginia, had followed the suggestions in the book How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby , which detailed how to optimally time intercourse in order to conceive a girl. So when the sonogram image left no doubt that her daughter was, in fact, another son, a shocked Thompson burst into tears. "I didn't want to be just a mother of boys," she explains. Although Thompson says she immediately fell in love with her son, she still felt a void that could only be filled by little frilly dresses. Thompson became a mom on a mission, scouring the Internet for a way to guarantee that baby number three would be her dream daughter. Her quest landed her at the Genetics & IVF Institute, in Fairfax, Virginia, where a clinical trial is currently under way to test the safety and efficacy of a sperm-sorting process called MicroSort. After three rounds of artificial insemination, Thompson finally conceived her little girl. "Our family wouldn't be complete without her," says Thompson, who makes no apologies for taking the extra steps to ensure that her last baby would come home swaddled in pink. Different Times, Same Hope Throughout history, parents have tried to influence their children's gender. In ancient Greece, men believed they could father a boy if they had sex while lying on their right side. French men in the 1700s tied off their left testicle in the hopes of producing sons. Library shelves have long been lined with books offering gender-selection folk wisdom, some of it even scientifically based. Still, a couple's odds of naturally conceiving their dream son or daughter remained at about 50/50 -- until the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978 ushered in a brave new world of baby-making. Today, thanks to advances in reproductive technology, couples can not only get help conceiving their baby, they can also choose their child's sex. And everyone -- from parents and fertility specialists to medical organizations and bioethicists -- has an opinion about whether this progress is a blessing or a curse. Upping the Odds The crudest way of choosing a child's gender is through a "selective abortion." Amniocentesis , the early-pregnancy test that screens for genetic diseases, determines the gender of a fetus , and if it's not the "right" one, the mother can then abort the pregnancy . While this method is reportedly used in some parts of the world, it is not common here, although fertility experts say it isn't unheard of either. There are three more sophisticated sex-selection methods available to today's moms -- each also involving significant drawbacks and ethical considerations. The oldest was developed in the mid 1970s by geneticist Ronald Ericsson, PhD. This method relies on the fact that the X chromosomes (female) in sperm are larger and denser than the Y chromosomes (male). Sperm is filtered through a human serum, which separates the faster-swimming male sperm from the slower female sperm. Women are then artificially inseminated with the sperm containing a higher ratio of the desired gender. Although this is relatively affordable (at $2,000 per cycle) and is not medically invasive, it fails as often as three out of 10 times. A more successful method is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), a test originally developed to screen for sex-linked genetic diseases, such as hemophilia and muscular dystrophy, which disproportionately affect boys. This process can only be done during in vitro fertilization (IVF), in which a woman's eggs are surgically removed from her ovaries and then fertilized with her partner's sperm in a laboratory dish. In a routine IVF procedure, the fertilized embryos are transferred back to the woman's uterus; but with PGD, one or two cells are removed from each embryo. By analyzing these cells, doctors can tell -- with almost 100 percent accuracy -- the boys from the girls. The "preferred" embryos are then used in the IVF process, while the others are either donated to another couple or to research, where they are eventually destroyed. (Many people find the destruction of embryos to be morally reprehensible.) A newer, more promising technique is MicroSort, a variation on the Ericsson method. Sperm is stained with a special dye and then run through a machine that can distinguish male DNA from female DNA in the sperm and sort out the unwanted gender. Women are then inseminated with sperm carrying the chromosomes of their choice. MicroSort has been in clinical trials since 1993. Initially, those trials were only open to couples with histories of sex-linked diseases, but they quickly expanded to include people who wanted to choose their baby's gender. To date, 86 percent of the nearly 800 couples who've conceived through MicroSort have done so for sex selection. The process is expensive: Each attempt at fertilization through IVF costs from $15,000 to $20,000. And it's far from foolproof: Sperm sorting has up to a 90 percent success rate at helping women conceive girls, but only a 76 percent rate for boys. Still, if the trials prove the method is safe and effective, MicroSort plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve the procedure. If that happens -- and if some of the newer sex-selection methods currently being researched come to fruition -- picking your child's gender could become as routine as shopping for a luxury car. A Right to Choose? There's no consensus on the propriety of "family balancing," as it's called in the fertility industry. A recent survey conducted by the Genetics and Public Policy Center, a division of Johns Hopkins University's Berman Bioethics Institute, found that only 40 percent of respondents supported sex selection for nonmedical reasons. "The idea that you could pick future offspring to meet certain design specifications is troublesome to a lot of people," says Kathy Hudson, PhD, the center's founder and director. Even our nation's medical organizations are divided on the issue. Both the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists oppose using sex selection for "family balancing," claiming the practice serves no medical purpose. But the American Society for Reproductive Medicine -- the organization most fertility doctors look to for ethical guidance -- has given the nod to sperm-sorting methods like MicroSort. (The organization does not endorse postconception techniques like PGD that entail the potential destruction of embryos.) President Bush's Council on Bioethics keeps a close eye on issues like these, but so far it hasn't made any policy recommendations. "We're concerned about the potential for eugenics -- the notion that the human race can be improved through genetics and selective breeding," says Gilbert Meilaender, PhD, a member of the council and an ethics professor at Valparaiso University, in Indiana. While scientists say we're still far from being able to choose characteristics such as intelligence, hair color, or height, critics say sex selection has us sliding down a slippery slope. Balanced Family Dynamics Aside from the broad societal implications of gender selection, there are more immediate concerns. "We need to consider the psychological and emotional effects of this on families," says Linda Applegarth, EdD, director of psychological services at the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility, in New York City. She worries that the process could be damaging to kids. "Parents who take these extreme steps to ensure a certain gender most likely have inflated expectations for that child," she says. "What if their daughter hates Barbies? What if their son prefers dance to sports? These parents spent thousands of dollars to get their dream child. That's a tremendous amount of pressure to put on a child." And then there's concern about the impact on other children in the family. "It's like telling your older children, 'Mommy wanted you, but not as badly as I wanted your little brother or sister,'" points out Josephine Johnston, an ethics expert at the Hastings Center, a medical ethics think tank in Garrison, New York. Still, such considerations don't deter people like Jeffrey Steinberg, MD, medical director of the privately run Fertility Institutes, who estimates that his company has helped more than 2,000 couples choose a baby's gender since his three clinics began offering PGD for that purpose. "Families want this," Dr. Steinberg says. "It's a matter of reproductive freedom, which we cherish in America." Jennifer Merrill Thompson, who ultimately wrote a book, Chasing the Gender Dream , about her quest for a daughter, agrees. "As the technology becomes more widely available and accepted, I think a lot of kids are going to be conceived this way," she says. And if her daughter someday asks about her birth ? "I'll tell her she was conceived as her brothers were. With love." Sex-Selection Folk Wisdom Some people tout these no-tech ways for conceiving a son or daughter. We offer no guarantees! Choose the right position. The rear-entry position is supposedly best for couples wanting a boy because it deposits the male sperm closer to the egg and farther away from the vagina's acidic environment. Try the missionary position to go for a girl because shallow penetration makes it harder for weaker male sperm to reach the egg. Go for the "O." (If you want a boy, that is.) When a woman climaxes, the vagina becomes less acidic and more alkaline, which makes it easier for male sperm to survive. Plus the contractions that accompany an orgasm help move the male sperm into the cervix. Monitor the moon. Women's menstrual cycles (and therefore ovulation) can be affected by the monthly push and pull of the moon's electromagnetic field. For a girl, have sex when the moon is full; for a boy, when there's a quarter moon. Watch what you eat. Six weeks before trying for a baby, start a diet rich in potassium (red meats, vegetables, and salt) if you want a boy, or one that's high in calcium and magnesium (milk, cheese, cereals, beans) if you want a girl. These diets are thought to change a woman's pH level, which may determine the gender of the baby she conceives. A World Out of Whack Opponents of sex selection worry about what it would do to the natural balance of males and females. In a Cleveland State University study, as many as 94 percent of parents who favored sex selection said they'd want their firstborn to be a son. "A nation of little sisters would negatively affect women's roles in society," says Sujatha Jesudason, director of the Program on Gender, Justice, and Human Genetics at the Center for Genetics and Society, in Oakland, California. Many think more parents would choose boys overall -- a reality that has already had a significant impact on large segments of the world. One study estimates that, globally, there are as many as 80 million fewer females due to selective abortions and infanticide. In China, for example, there are 117 boys born for every 100 girls (the normal average is about 106 boys for every 100 girls). Sociologists think that this imbalance is already creating social havoc in these societies. Copyright ? 2006. Reprinted with permission from the July 2006 issue of Parents magazine.

So don't wait until you ovulate. Use our handy dandy ovulation calculator to help you plan to do the deed two or more days before ovulation. Or you could try The Whelan Method , named after Elizabeth Whelan, author of Boy or Girl, which is basically the opposite approach. The Shettles Method boasts a slightly higher success rate of 75 percent at conceiving the child of choice.

That is supposedly more favorable for Y-chromosome (boy) sperm. Check the ingredients list to be sure you're getting one with only the guaifenesin and not one for multi-cold symptoms.

So it's like giving those faster, male sperm a head start to the finish line. Don't feel cheated though; you'll get yours soon.

So try an alkaline diet a few weeks before conception. Here's an acid/alkaline food chart to get you started. Bumping up your sodium and potassium intake is also suggested for those trying to conceive boys. Start off your morning with a power smoothie with green powder. If nothing else, it will get you healthier, which is great for your pre-baby body.

If only we'd tell you that your chances of conceiving a boy would increase by consuming chocolate while catching up on your Netflix list in your yoga pants too, right? Hit the weights, and focus on strength training because weight loss is said to sway toward baby girls.  Shutterstock Image     Shutterstock For a Girl Skip  the Salt Salt is not good for you or your chances of having a girl, supposedly. The theory is to make dietary changes to alter your body's pH levels a few weeks before trying to conceive. Acidic conditions are said to kill boy sperm. However, this doesn't mean covering your food in lemon and vinegar. Here's an acid/alkaline food chart for reference. Bumping up your calcium and magnesium intake is also suggested.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

What are the signs I'm having a baby girl?  Take our boy or girl quiz      Video Boy or girl? Watch how your baby develops into a boy or girl.  You're bound to be curious about your baby's gender , even if you're waiting until the birth to find out. But what if you could tell just by the season in which you conceived, or by what job your partner has? Folk tales are one thing, but what real-life factors may affect the gender of your baby?  What are the signs I'm having a baby boy? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a boy if:  You and your partner are living together  One large study of 86,000 parents showed that couples who were living together when they conceived were slightly more likely to have a boy (Norberg 2004) .  Just over half (51.5 per cent) of couples living together before conception had a boy, compared with 49.9 per cent of those who lived apart. But why domestic bliss results in more boys is not entirely clear.  You've been living together for less than a year  If your relationship is new and exciting, you'll probably be having lots of sex (Brewis and Meyer 2005) . Frequent sex gives male sperm a slightly bigger advantage than usual.  Male sperm are lighter, have smaller heads, and shorter tails (Jongbloet 2004) . They can swim more easily through the slightly less hospitable fertile mucus , which coincides with the beginning and the end of your fertile window . This includes the time of ovulation (Jongbloet 2004) .  Some experts think that female sperm are more likely to reach the egg in the middle of your fertile period (James 2008) .  By having frequent sex, you are more likely to have sex at the start and end of your fertile window, when male sperm have a slight advantage.  You're feeling stressed  Boys tend to be conceived at times of sustained stress , such as during and following a war (Helle et al 2009, Hohmann et al 2010) .  One theory is that the mum's high stress levels leads to increases in testosterone and cortisol (Grant 2007, Grant and Irwin 2009) . This may lead to changes in the egg, which make it easier for male sperm to penetrate.  Just how this happens isn't clear, but there is still so much we don't know about the exact moment of conception .  You have a higher calorie intake  One study divided 740 British women into groups according to their calorie intake (Mathews et al 2008) . Of the women who had the highest energy intake (about 2,413 calories), 56 per cent had boys. Of the women who had the lowest energy intake (about 2,283 calories), only 45 per cent had boys.  Boys are more fragile and are statistically less likely to be conceived, or to survive pregnancy, when food is short. Girl sperm are more robust, so in harder times they may be more able to survive.  But it's clear that, whether you're having a boy or a girl, a healthy diet is important both before you conceive and during pregnancy .  What are the signs I'm having a baby girl? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a girl if:  You're over 35 years old and the dad-to-be is over 40 years old  The older the mum and dad , the more likely the female sperm are to fertilise the egg (Matsuo et al 2009) . This could be due to hormonal influences in the woman as she ages. And in older dads , the female sperm is more likely to win the race. The quality of sperm deteriorates with age and older men produce fewer male sperm.  Or it could be because we tend to have sex less often (Brewis 2005) as we get older. Also, older couples may be more likely to have sex in the middle of the fertile period, when female sperm may have the edge over male sperm.  You suffer badly from pregnancy sickness  If you have severe pregnancy sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum), you're slightly more likely to have a baby girl.  A review of 13 studies found that 55 per cent of babies born to women who'd had severe pregnancy sickness were girls (Veenendaal et al 2011) . This was compared with 49 per cent in the control group of women who didn't suffer from it. Some experts think that this is due to high levels of the hormone oestrogen, which is linked with pregnancy sickness .  You were born in a tropical climate and conceived there  Fancy a long holiday, somewhere warm?  It's not clear how much time you and your partner would need to spend in a tropical climate for there to be any effect, or if you would need to have been born there, too. But a global survey of birth data showed that more girls are born in the tropics (the region around the equator) than anywhere else in the world (Navara 2009) .  One theory is that the hormone melatonin has an effect. Melatonin causes changes in the reproductive systems of animals in response to the length of the day. More females are born when the days are longer. Or it could be that a high temperature alters the survival of male or female sperm in semen.  Your baby was conceived in the winter  However, in some countries, more girls are conceived in winter, and more boys are conceived in the summer (Cagnacci et al 2003, Melnikov and Grech 2003) . Farmers have noticed this effect in their animals for many years.  This may be because more viral and bacterial infections are around in the winter. As male sperm and embryos are more fragile, girls may be more able to withstand mums catching infections than boys.  Dad-to-be's job involves pollutants or stress  A few studies have looked at the dad's occupation and the ratio of boys and girls born to them. They found that jobs that involve stress or pollutants seem to result in more girls.  Though they were small-scale studies, which only looked at certain occupations, dads with the following jobs resulted in more girls than average:   professional driver (James 2008) deep-sea diver (James 2008) submarine sonar technician (Volk 2004) flour mill worker (Milham and Ossiander 2008) high-performance pilot (James 2008)  You conceived after having your ovulation induced hormonally  Some studies carried out among women who used hormones to induce ovulation, such as clomifene , show that you are slightly more likely to have a girl if artificial hormones are involved (James 2008) . However, other experts aren't convinced.  You already have two or more children  It's possible that the more children you have, the more likely you are to have a girl. This may be due to the fact that the more pregnancies you have, the higher your levels of the hormone gonadotrophin (James 1980) . Some experts have claimed that these higher hormonal levels could be linked to a higher chance of having a girl.  Take our boy or girl quiz  Find out whether you're more likely to have a girl or a boy. Last reviewed: October 2013   References   Brewis A, Meyer M. 2005. Marital coitus across the life course.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

Fathers especially, can be eager to have a boy but there are also mothers who long for a son. Most couples however, are happy with either a boy or a girl baby, as long as it is healthy and strong.  But if you are keen to try to sway the odds of having a boy then there is no harm in trying. Just remember that there are no guarantees and the odds of conceiving a boy or a girl are almost exactly the same for each and every pregnancy.  No matter what claims are made by companies asserting their skills in predicting whether a boy or girl will be conceived , don’t be too trusting. A lot of time, money, trust and energy can be wasted by couples who think they can consciously influence their baby’s gender.  It’s worth remembering  that the only scientifically proven strategy which can sway the odds, just slightly, is the timing of intercourse.  Diet , lunar calendars, sexual positions and even the boy/girl patterning within families do not change the likelihood of gender determination.   Top tips for conceiving a boy   Time sex to coincide with the day of ovulation (no earlier than 24 hours before you are about to ovulate).  Deep penetrative sex is preferable.  It helps if the woman orgasms.  Have an energy drink, a cup of coffee or some chocolate before having sex.  Get your partner to trade in the tightie-whities for some boxer shorts.  What’s a fact and what’s a fallacy?  Fact – men influence the gender of the baby, not women. Men provide the sperm which either has an X (girl) or Y (boy) linked sex chromosome.  There is no sure-fire guarantee of having a baby of a particular gender. Hoping and trying for a boy or girl is just that, and does not influence the odds in either direction.  One testicle does not produce girl sperm and the other boy sperm. Both produce an equal number of X and Y sperm and it is random chance, rather than management, which one fertilises the egg.  Some men do seem to produce better quality X or Y sperm which may account for the reason why particular families have large numbers of girls or boys.  Herbal and complementary medicine remedies do not impact on the likelihood of having a girl or a boy. They tend to offer spurious claims which are not based on scientific fact and reason.  Can’t I choose which sex my baby is? At the current time in Australia, the only occasion when gender selection is done via fertility assistance is when there is a likelihood of the baby inheriting a sex linked disorder. Genetic counselling is often recommended as one part of an overall treatment regime. It is true that in some countries ‘designer babies’ are more common, with clinics freely advertising their success rates. Though the important issues of control over biology, quality of the parent/child relationship and expectations which may be placed on the ‘perfect’ child need to be thought about by parents very carefully in advance.   Characteristics of boy sperm  What this means to you   Are identified as looking like a Y  Nothing really, just an interesting point.  Are not as resilient or strong as girl sperm.  Interesting but nothing more.  Have short bursts of power before they fizzle out in energy.  This affects the timing of sex to coincide with ovulation; don’t expect them to hang around.  Are not capable of fertilising the egg past 24 hours after they have left the man’s body.  Timing sex to coincide with the day of ovulation may help slightly to increase the odds of having a boy.  Move at high speed towards the egg. Interesting but out of your control.   Characteristics of girl sperm  What this means to you  Are identified as looking like an X. Interesting – some people remember the differences because they claim that the extra arm on the x indicates more strength.  Are more resilient and live for longer than Y sperm. This means they can still fertilise the egg 4-5 days after they have left the man’s body. You don’t need to be so particular about timing sex to coincide with ovulation. Female sperm can wait around for longer until the egg is ready to be fertilised.  Require less ‘nurturing’ to find their way to the egg. Interesting, but you don’t need to do anything consciously to look after them. Just don’t douche.  Move more slowly than Y sperm but retain their energy. Again, you don’t need to do anything in particular. Timing of intercourse The timing of when a couple has sex is thought to actually make a difference in helping to conceive with a boy. It is one of the strategies suggested in The Shettles Method , which claims that the chances of having a boy are boosted when conception occurs as close to ovulation as possible. Boy or Y sperm are not as resilient as the X or female sperm, and according to Shettles it may help to provide a bit of additional support in supporting the Y sperm to get to their destination and not have to compete any more than they absolutely have to.    Of course, this all depends on the willingness of a couple to track the woman’s ovulation and be available to each other over those crucial fertile hours. According to Shettles, if you want a boy then avoid having sex:  no earlier than 24 hours before you are about to “ovulate”/conception/ovulation.  not after 12 hours since you have ovulated.  Shettles also advises that if couples want to conceive with a boy:  Best positions : deep penetrative sex is preferable. This helps to deposit the semen and sperm closest to the woman’s cervix so they are given the best opportunity to get to the egg in the fallopian tube. Twelve hours before ovulation is thought to maximise the chances of conceiving with a boy.  It also helps if the woman orgasms. This boosts the alkaline properties of the vagina which again, supports the sperm to do their work. Orgasm also causes uterine and vaginal contractions which help to push the sperm upwards where they need to go.  How do I know when I’ve ovulated?  Many women develop a distinctive pain on one side of their lower pelvis, which occurs mid-way through their monthly cycle.  Changes in the cervical mucous. Fertile mucous is clear, watery and stretchy – it appears similar to egg white. The cells change to encourage the smooth passage of sperm upwards through the cervix towards the fallopian tubes. Fertile mucous is also less acidic than non-fertile mucous and this environment favours the sperm rather than killing them off.  You could try using an ovulation testing kit . These detect hormonal changes which occur at ovulation, particularly an increase in Luteinizing Hormone. But there is still some disagreement over their effectiveness. Kits cost anywhere between $25.00 – $40.00.  You may feel different. Women who have ovulated and are at their most fertile often experience and increase in their libido, they appear more attractive and are more relaxed.  An increase in your basal body temperature . This is the lowest temperature which is attained by your body during rest and sleep. Just before ovulation occurs there is a rise in the temperature by a couple of degrees. If you are trying to conceive a boy, then it can be useful to chart your basal body temperature for a few months so you know your peak times of fertility.  General tips to help conceive a boy  Caffeine may help to give the Y laden sperm an additional boost. An energy drink, cup of coffee or even some chocolate before having sex won’t do any harm.  Suggest your partner change his underpants preference if he’s into the tighter briefs. Boxer shorts may look less glamorous but they don’t ‘hug’ the testicles close to the body and cause them to overheat.  This in turn, can reduce the number of sperm which are produced and in turn, the likelihood of conceiving with a boy.  What about the food I’m eating? It does seem that male sperm prefer an alkaline vaginal environment, which is where the correlation between diet and gender selection comes in. But whether or not eating a less acidic diet makes a difference is still open to debate. But it probably does no harm. If you want to conceive a boy baby then you may want to consider eating less of these types of foods:  Spicy foods which contain vinegar, citrus juices and fruits and tart/tangy flavours.  Avoid eating dairy foods such as milk, cheese, youghurt and ice-cream.  Eat more foods which contain potassium such as bananas, broccoli, potatoes, spinach and brussel sprouts.  Some researchers believe that taking a daily supplement of Evening Primrose Oil boosts the chances of conceiving a boy.  Try eating more of these foods:  Bread, avocado, almonds, sprouts and wheatgrass.  Pine nuts and cherries.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!  You'll also want to see: What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?             Gender Odds   What are the odds of having another boy or girl?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  Does having boys or girls run in the family?

It claims that there is some science behind getting one gender over the other. According to shettles, male sperm are faster but die quicker and female sperm are slower but live longer. The closer to ovulation you dtd, the higher your chances are for a boy. But I think this only slightly increases your odds either way. It's still basically 50/50.

(We thought we were done) Not sure what I think this time. Ha  I do know two families with b,b,b,g and don't know any personally with 4 boys. Although I know several with 4 girls.  We are hoping to break the pattern in our family. Sister has 3 boys, brother has 3 boys, BIL has 2 boys and we have 3 girls. Nobody has both. Reply  Close M  MamaChrista @MamaHLB  your husband's sperm is who decides the sex of the baby. Women all provide an X chromosome, and the husband provides the y or x chromosome that determines the sex. XY-boy XX-girl. With my dd we really wanted a boy but my intuition said she was a girl. For this baby my intuition says it's a girl again. Reply  Close g  garciakm So antiquated but my family swears by the hair tests.  1. Cowlick on the left - girl next 2.

I had no intuition/clue what I was having with my first 2 Boys and I convinced myself although we never found out that the Baby I miscarried was a little Girl, and then I had an intuition with my 13mo Boy that he was a Boy even though We didn't find out until he was born. This time around I had dreams I was pregnant with a little Girl for the 3 days before I took my positive pregnancy test but just within the last few days I am convinced I am having a Boy. I am only 5 weeks and 4 days and I am not sure if Mother's Intuition is right this time or if that gets jaded when you have all these other feelings surrounding it such as hoping its a Girl since its our last and wanting My Husband and I to get to experience that. My Father and oldest Son have also expressed hope that its a Girl so I am wondering if I am thinking its a Boy now in hopes to prepare myself in case its not and because I think I only make Boys? My oldest Son thinks its a Girl but he thought my 13mo was a Girl too. Anyone have a similar experience with any of their gender stuff during pregnancies or know how I am feeling?

My cousin had 3 boys and when she got pregnant with her 4th, she had made sure to try all those methods to get a girl even the craziest one, and #4 was a boy. She cried and cried, not because she was unhappy with another healthy boy but she knew it was her last and was simply mourning the fact she'd never have a daughter of her own.

My grandma has 5 boys, my uncle has 4 boys, I have 2 brothers, and my other uncles each have one girl and 2 boys. Since having a girl comes from your so side look at his family and see. My so is one of 4 2 boys and 2 girls. His 2 sisters have a different dad though so he has 1 full brother. So I would say my chances of having another boy are pretty high.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Visit our community    Can you really choose the sex of your baby? For as long as we've been making babies , women have been exchanging ideas about how to increase their chances of having either a boy or a girl. Unfortunately there's no medical evidence that any of them actually work!  Having said that, there'll always be a mum who tells you an old wives' tale worked for her. So if you fancy defying the experts and trying to tip the balance towards one sex yourself, why not try some of the suggestions below.   You're more likely to conceive a boy if... You have sex on the day of ovulation , as male sperm are thought to swim faster and reach the egg first. You reach orgasm before your partner, as this releases an alkaline fluid, thought to be more male-sperm friendly than the vagina's natural acidity. You have deep penetration during sex, such as from behind (doggie-style). Your partner has a high sperm count. This is because male sperm are not as strong as female sperm, and so the higher the count, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first. You avoid sex for a week before ovulation and then only have sex once on ovulation day, to keep the sperm count high. Your partner suggested the love-making. You make love at night. You make love on odd days of the month. Your partner keeps his genitals cool by wearing boxer shorts and loose-fitting trousers. You eat salty food, plenty of meat, fish, white flour, pasta, fresh fruit, certain vegetables, but avoid milk and dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, nuts, chocolate, shellfish and wholemeal bread. You're more likely to conceive a girl if... You have sex earlier on in your cycle, a few days before your day of ovulation. This is because female sperm are thought to be stronger and therefore last longer than male sperm, who will die off before reaching the egg. Your partner reaches orgasm before you. You have sex frequently to lower your partner's sperm count, and so increase the chances of the female sperm reaching the egg first. You keep penetration shallow. You stop having unprotected sex four to five days before ovulation, to minimise the chances of the male sperm reaching the egg first. Your partner keeps his genitals warm by wearing close-fitting underwear and tight trousers (although this isn't likely to do his general fertility any good!) You suggested the love-making. You make love in the afternoon. You make love on even days of the month. You put a wooden spoon under your bed and a pink ribbon under your pillow. You drink plenty of milk and eat dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, unsalted foods, rice, pasta, certain vegetables, mineral water, limited amounts of meat and potatoes, but avoid salt and any salty foods, wine and beer, fresh fruit, spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms, chocolate, coffee and tea.

I have two boys and have been blogging about wanting to have a girl for some time. I had gone through most of the experiences posted by women, like gender dieting, douching etc but they didn't really make any sense to me. Ultimately, I picked Urobiologics (based in the US) who have literally proven that, although gender is 'determined' by sperms, women select the gender of the baby based on the cycle she conceives, by choosing to conceive in the correct alternating cycle. We were given a conception plan to try to conceive in the girl cycle (you send off urine samples to Urobiologics, who will then determine when you will be in a boy or girl cycle). We became pregnant with our girl (we used their post-gender test to check the gender of the baby at around 7 weeks). Sadly our little Poppy girl died at 16 weeks (31 Oct) due to a PPROM, so we are leaving it a couple of months to heal and then go via the PreGender Preconception Test route again. I'm ready now!

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

These formative years are when their personalities are developed and they first start to gain some independence and, most importantly, individuality.....12-18 monthsIt's often said that a twin grows up with a built-in playmate, but each child's temperament, abilities and interests determine how well multiples interact.

But is that such a good thing? By Jeannette Moninger from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print An Eternal Quest         Jennifer Merrill Thompson was confident the baby she was carrying -- her second -- was a girl. After all, the mom from Vienna, Virginia, had followed the suggestions in the book How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby , which detailed how to optimally time intercourse in order to conceive a girl. So when the sonogram image left no doubt that her daughter was, in fact, another son, a shocked Thompson burst into tears. "I didn't want to be just a mother of boys," she explains. Although Thompson says she immediately fell in love with her son, she still felt a void that could only be filled by little frilly dresses. Thompson became a mom on a mission, scouring the Internet for a way to guarantee that baby number three would be her dream daughter. Her quest landed her at the Genetics & IVF Institute, in Fairfax, Virginia, where a clinical trial is currently under way to test the safety and efficacy of a sperm-sorting process called MicroSort. After three rounds of artificial insemination, Thompson finally conceived her little girl. "Our family wouldn't be complete without her," says Thompson, who makes no apologies for taking the extra steps to ensure that her last baby would come home swaddled in pink. Different Times, Same Hope Throughout history, parents have tried to influence their children's gender. In ancient Greece, men believed they could father a boy if they had sex while lying on their right side. French men in the 1700s tied off their left testicle in the hopes of producing sons. Library shelves have long been lined with books offering gender-selection folk wisdom, some of it even scientifically based. Still, a couple's odds of naturally conceiving their dream son or daughter remained at about 50/50 -- until the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978 ushered in a brave new world of baby-making. Today, thanks to advances in reproductive technology, couples can not only get help conceiving their baby, they can also choose their child's sex. And everyone -- from parents and fertility specialists to medical organizations and bioethicists -- has an opinion about whether this progress is a blessing or a curse. Upping the Odds The crudest way of choosing a child's gender is through a "selective abortion." Amniocentesis , the early-pregnancy test that screens for genetic diseases, determines the gender of a fetus , and if it's not the "right" one, the mother can then abort the pregnancy . While this method is reportedly used in some parts of the world, it is not common here, although fertility experts say it isn't unheard of either. There are three more sophisticated sex-selection methods available to today's moms -- each also involving significant drawbacks and ethical considerations. The oldest was developed in the mid 1970s by geneticist Ronald Ericsson, PhD. This method relies on the fact that the X chromosomes (female) in sperm are larger and denser than the Y chromosomes (male). Sperm is filtered through a human serum, which separates the faster-swimming male sperm from the slower female sperm. Women are then artificially inseminated with the sperm containing a higher ratio of the desired gender. Although this is relatively affordable (at $2,000 per cycle) and is not medically invasive, it fails as often as three out of 10 times. A more successful method is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), a test originally developed to screen for sex-linked genetic diseases, such as hemophilia and muscular dystrophy, which disproportionately affect boys. This process can only be done during in vitro fertilization (IVF), in which a woman's eggs are surgically removed from her ovaries and then fertilized with her partner's sperm in a laboratory dish. In a routine IVF procedure, the fertilized embryos are transferred back to the woman's uterus; but with PGD, one or two cells are removed from each embryo. By analyzing these cells, doctors can tell -- with almost 100 percent accuracy -- the boys from the girls. The "preferred" embryos are then used in the IVF process, while the others are either donated to another couple or to research, where they are eventually destroyed. (Many people find the destruction of embryos to be morally reprehensible.) A newer, more promising technique is MicroSort, a variation on the Ericsson method. Sperm is stained with a special dye and then run through a machine that can distinguish male DNA from female DNA in the sperm and sort out the unwanted gender. Women are then inseminated with sperm carrying the chromosomes of their choice. MicroSort has been in clinical trials since 1993. Initially, those trials were only open to couples with histories of sex-linked diseases, but they quickly expanded to include people who wanted to choose their baby's gender. To date, 86 percent of the nearly 800 couples who've conceived through MicroSort have done so for sex selection. The process is expensive: Each attempt at fertilization through IVF costs from $15,000 to $20,000. And it's far from foolproof: Sperm sorting has up to a 90 percent success rate at helping women conceive girls, but only a 76 percent rate for boys. Still, if the trials prove the method is safe and effective, MicroSort plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve the procedure. If that happens -- and if some of the newer sex-selection methods currently being researched come to fruition -- picking your child's gender could become as routine as shopping for a luxury car. A Right to Choose? There's no consensus on the propriety of "family balancing," as it's called in the fertility industry. A recent survey conducted by the Genetics and Public Policy Center, a division of Johns Hopkins University's Berman Bioethics Institute, found that only 40 percent of respondents supported sex selection for nonmedical reasons. "The idea that you could pick future offspring to meet certain design specifications is troublesome to a lot of people," says Kathy Hudson, PhD, the center's founder and director. Even our nation's medical organizations are divided on the issue. Both the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists oppose using sex selection for "family balancing," claiming the practice serves no medical purpose. But the American Society for Reproductive Medicine -- the organization most fertility doctors look to for ethical guidance -- has given the nod to sperm-sorting methods like MicroSort. (The organization does not endorse postconception techniques like PGD that entail the potential destruction of embryos.) President Bush's Council on Bioethics keeps a close eye on issues like these, but so far it hasn't made any policy recommendations. "We're concerned about the potential for eugenics -- the notion that the human race can be improved through genetics and selective breeding," says Gilbert Meilaender, PhD, a member of the council and an ethics professor at Valparaiso University, in Indiana. While scientists say we're still far from being able to choose characteristics such as intelligence, hair color, or height, critics say sex selection has us sliding down a slippery slope. Balanced Family Dynamics Aside from the broad societal implications of gender selection, there are more immediate concerns. "We need to consider the psychological and emotional effects of this on families," says Linda Applegarth, EdD, director of psychological services at the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility, in New York City. She worries that the process could be damaging to kids. "Parents who take these extreme steps to ensure a certain gender most likely have inflated expectations for that child," she says. "What if their daughter hates Barbies? What if their son prefers dance to sports? These parents spent thousands of dollars to get their dream child. That's a tremendous amount of pressure to put on a child." And then there's concern about the impact on other children in the family. "It's like telling your older children, 'Mommy wanted you, but not as badly as I wanted your little brother or sister,'" points out Josephine Johnston, an ethics expert at the Hastings Center, a medical ethics think tank in Garrison, New York. Still, such considerations don't deter people like Jeffrey Steinberg, MD, medical director of the privately run Fertility Institutes, who estimates that his company has helped more than 2,000 couples choose a baby's gender since his three clinics began offering PGD for that purpose. "Families want this," Dr. Steinberg says. "It's a matter of reproductive freedom, which we cherish in America." Jennifer Merrill Thompson, who ultimately wrote a book, Chasing the Gender Dream , about her quest for a daughter, agrees. "As the technology becomes more widely available and accepted, I think a lot of kids are going to be conceived this way," she says. And if her daughter someday asks about her birth ? "I'll tell her she was conceived as her brothers were. With love." Sex-Selection Folk Wisdom Some people tout these no-tech ways for conceiving a son or daughter. We offer no guarantees! Choose the right position. The rear-entry position is supposedly best for couples wanting a boy because it deposits the male sperm closer to the egg and farther away from the vagina's acidic environment. Try the missionary position to go for a girl because shallow penetration makes it harder for weaker male sperm to reach the egg. Go for the "O." (If you want a boy, that is.) When a woman climaxes, the vagina becomes less acidic and more alkaline, which makes it easier for male sperm to survive. Plus the contractions that accompany an orgasm help move the male sperm into the cervix. Monitor the moon. Women's menstrual cycles (and therefore ovulation) can be affected by the monthly push and pull of the moon's electromagnetic field. For a girl, have sex when the moon is full; for a boy, when there's a quarter moon. Watch what you eat. Six weeks before trying for a baby, start a diet rich in potassium (red meats, vegetables, and salt) if you want a boy, or one that's high in calcium and magnesium (milk, cheese, cereals, beans) if you want a girl. These diets are thought to change a woman's pH level, which may determine the gender of the baby she conceives. A World Out of Whack Opponents of sex selection worry about what it would do to the natural balance of males and females. In a Cleveland State University study, as many as 94 percent of parents who favored sex selection said they'd want their firstborn to be a son. "A nation of little sisters would negatively affect women's roles in society," says Sujatha Jesudason, director of the Program on Gender, Justice, and Human Genetics at the Center for Genetics and Society, in Oakland, California. Many think more parents would choose boys overall -- a reality that has already had a significant impact on large segments of the world. One study estimates that, globally, there are as many as 80 million fewer females due to selective abortions and infanticide. In China, for example, there are 117 boys born for every 100 girls (the normal average is about 106 boys for every 100 girls). Sociologists think that this imbalance is already creating social havoc in these societies. Copyright ? 2006. Reprinted with permission from the July 2006 issue of Parents magazine.

So don't wait until you ovulate. Use our handy dandy ovulation calculator to help you plan to do the deed two or more days before ovulation. Or you could try The Whelan Method , named after Elizabeth Whelan, author of Boy or Girl, which is basically the opposite approach. The Shettles Method boasts a slightly higher success rate of 75 percent at conceiving the child of choice.

That is supposedly more favorable for Y-chromosome (boy) sperm. Check the ingredients list to be sure you're getting one with only the guaifenesin and not one for multi-cold symptoms.  Shutterstock Image     Shutterstock For a Girl Just Say "No" to the Big O Women's orgasms move sperm closer to the cervix. So it's like giving those faster, male sperm a head start to the finish line. Don't feel cheated though; you'll get yours soon. Many moms claim pregnant sex is the best they've had due to increased blood flow down below.  Shutterstock Image     Shutterstock For a Boy Acid Trip Acidic conditions are said to kill boy sperm. So try an alkaline diet a few weeks before conception. Here's an acid/alkaline food chart to get you started. Bumping up your sodium and potassium intake is also suggested for those trying to conceive boys. Start off your morning with a power smoothie with green powder. If nothing else, it will get you healthier, which is great for your pre-baby body.

If only we'd tell you that your chances of conceiving a boy would increase by consuming chocolate while catching up on your Netflix list in your yoga pants too, right? Hit the weights, and focus on strength training because weight loss is said to sway toward baby girls.  Shutterstock Image     Shutterstock For a Girl Skip  the Salt Salt is not good for you or your chances of having a girl, supposedly. The theory is to make dietary changes to alter your body's pH levels a few weeks before trying to conceive. Acidic conditions are said to kill boy sperm. However, this doesn't mean covering your food in lemon and vinegar. Here's an acid/alkaline food chart for reference. Bumping up your calcium and magnesium intake is also suggested.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

What are the signs I'm having a baby girl?  Take our boy or girl quiz      Video Boy or girl? Watch how your baby develops into a boy or girl.  You're bound to be curious about your baby's gender , even if you're waiting until the birth to find out. But what if you could tell just by the season in which you conceived, or by what job your partner has? Folk tales are one thing, but what real-life factors may affect the gender of your baby?  What are the signs I'm having a baby boy? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a boy if:  You and your partner are living together  One large study of 86,000 parents showed that couples who were living together when they conceived were slightly more likely to have a boy (Norberg 2004) .  Just over half (51.5 per cent) of couples living together before conception had a boy, compared with 49.9 per cent of those who lived apart. But why domestic bliss results in more boys is not entirely clear.  You've been living together for less than a year  If your relationship is new and exciting, you'll probably be having lots of sex (Brewis and Meyer 2005) . Frequent sex gives male sperm a slightly bigger advantage than usual.  Male sperm are lighter, have smaller heads, and shorter tails (Jongbloet 2004) . They can swim more easily through the slightly less hospitable fertile mucus , which coincides with the beginning and the end of your fertile window . This includes the time of ovulation (Jongbloet 2004) .  Some experts think that female sperm are more likely to reach the egg in the middle of your fertile period (James 2008) .  By having frequent sex, you are more likely to have sex at the start and end of your fertile window, when male sperm have a slight advantage.  You're feeling stressed  Boys tend to be conceived at times of sustained stress , such as during and following a war (Helle et al 2009, Hohmann et al 2010) .  One theory is that the mum's high stress levels leads to increases in testosterone and cortisol (Grant 2007, Grant and Irwin 2009) . This may lead to changes in the egg, which make it easier for male sperm to penetrate.  Just how this happens isn't clear, but there is still so much we don't know about the exact moment of conception .  You have a higher calorie intake  One study divided 740 British women into groups according to their calorie intake (Mathews et al 2008) . Of the women who had the highest energy intake (about 2,413 calories), 56 per cent had boys. Of the women who had the lowest energy intake (about 2,283 calories), only 45 per cent had boys.  Boys are more fragile and are statistically less likely to be conceived, or to survive pregnancy, when food is short. Girl sperm are more robust, so in harder times they may be more able to survive.  But it's clear that, whether you're having a boy or a girl, a healthy diet is important both before you conceive and during pregnancy .  What are the signs I'm having a baby girl? You may be slightly more likely to conceive a girl if:  You're over 35 years old and the dad-to-be is over 40 years old  The older the mum and dad , the more likely the female sperm are to fertilise the egg (Matsuo et al 2009) . This could be due to hormonal influences in the woman as she ages. And in older dads , the female sperm is more likely to win the race. The quality of sperm deteriorates with age and older men produce fewer male sperm.  Or it could be because we tend to have sex less often (Brewis 2005) as we get older. Also, older couples may be more likely to have sex in the middle of the fertile period, when female sperm may have the edge over male sperm.  You suffer badly from pregnancy sickness  If you have severe pregnancy sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum), you're slightly more likely to have a baby girl.  A review of 13 studies found that 55 per cent of babies born to women who'd had severe pregnancy sickness were girls (Veenendaal et al 2011) . This was compared with 49 per cent in the control group of women who didn't suffer from it. Some experts think that this is due to high levels of the hormone oestrogen, which is linked with pregnancy sickness .  You were born in a tropical climate and conceived there  Fancy a long holiday, somewhere warm?  It's not clear how much time you and your partner would need to spend in a tropical climate for there to be any effect, or if you would need to have been born there, too. But a global survey of birth data showed that more girls are born in the tropics (the region around the equator) than anywhere else in the world (Navara 2009) .  One theory is that the hormone melatonin has an effect. Melatonin causes changes in the reproductive systems of animals in response to the length of the day. More females are born when the days are longer. Or it could be that a high temperature alters the survival of male or female sperm in semen.  Your baby was conceived in the winter  However, in some countries, more girls are conceived in winter, and more boys are conceived in the summer (Cagnacci et al 2003, Melnikov and Grech 2003) . Farmers have noticed this effect in their animals for many years.  This may be because more viral and bacterial infections are around in the winter. As male sperm and embryos are more fragile, girls may be more able to withstand mums catching infections than boys.  Dad-to-be's job involves pollutants or stress  A few studies have looked at the dad's occupation and the ratio of boys and girls born to them. They found that jobs that involve stress or pollutants seem to result in more girls.  Though they were small-scale studies, which only looked at certain occupations, dads with the following jobs resulted in more girls than average:   professional driver (James 2008) deep-sea diver (James 2008) submarine sonar technician (Volk 2004) flour mill worker (Milham and Ossiander 2008) high-performance pilot (James 2008)  You conceived after having your ovulation induced hormonally  Some studies carried out among women who used hormones to induce ovulation, such as clomifene , show that you are slightly more likely to have a girl if artificial hormones are involved (James 2008) . However, other experts aren't convinced.  You already have two or more children  It's possible that the more children you have, the more likely you are to have a girl. This may be due to the fact that the more pregnancies you have, the higher your levels of the hormone gonadotrophin (James 1980) . Some experts have claimed that these higher hormonal levels could be linked to a higher chance of having a girl.  Take our boy or girl quiz  Find out whether you're more likely to have a girl or a boy. Last reviewed: October 2013   References   Brewis A, Meyer M. 2005. Marital coitus across the life course.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

Fathers especially, can be eager to have a boy but there are also mothers who long for a son. Most couples however, are happy with either a boy or a girl baby, as long as it is healthy and strong.  But if you are keen to try to sway the odds of having a boy then there is no harm in trying. Just remember that there are no guarantees and the odds of conceiving a boy or a girl are almost exactly the same for each and every pregnancy.  No matter what claims are made by companies asserting their skills in predicting whether a boy or girl will be conceived , don’t be too trusting. A lot of time, money, trust and energy can be wasted by couples who think they can consciously influence their baby’s gender.  It’s worth remembering  that the only scientifically proven strategy which can sway the odds, just slightly, is the timing of intercourse.  Diet , lunar calendars, sexual positions and even the boy/girl patterning within families do not change the likelihood of gender determination.   Top tips for conceiving a boy   Time sex to coincide with the day of ovulation (no earlier than 24 hours before you are about to ovulate).  Deep penetrative sex is preferable.  It helps if the woman orgasms.  Have an energy drink, a cup of coffee or some chocolate before having sex.  Get your partner to trade in the tightie-whities for some boxer shorts.  What’s a fact and what’s a fallacy?  Fact – men influence the gender of the baby, not women. Men provide the sperm which either has an X (girl) or Y (boy) linked sex chromosome.  There is no sure-fire guarantee of having a baby of a particular gender. Hoping and trying for a boy or girl is just that, and does not influence the odds in either direction.  One testicle does not produce girl sperm and the other boy sperm. Both produce an equal number of X and Y sperm and it is random chance, rather than management, which one fertilises the egg.  Some men do seem to produce better quality X or Y sperm which may account for the reason why particular families have large numbers of girls or boys.  Herbal and complementary medicine remedies do not impact on the likelihood of having a girl or a boy. They tend to offer spurious claims which are not based on scientific fact and reason.  Can’t I choose which sex my baby is? At the current time in Australia, the only occasion when gender selection is done via fertility assistance is when there is a likelihood of the baby inheriting a sex linked disorder. Genetic counselling is often recommended as one part of an overall treatment regime. It is true that in some countries ‘designer babies’ are more common, with clinics freely advertising their success rates. Though the important issues of control over biology, quality of the parent/child relationship and expectations which may be placed on the ‘perfect’ child need to be thought about by parents very carefully in advance.   Characteristics of boy sperm  What this means to you   Are identified as looking like a Y  Nothing really, just an interesting point.  Are not as resilient or strong as girl sperm.  Interesting but nothing more.  Have short bursts of power before they fizzle out in energy.  This affects the timing of sex to coincide with ovulation; don’t expect them to hang around.  Are not capable of fertilising the egg past 24 hours after they have left the man’s body.  Timing sex to coincide with the day of ovulation may help slightly to increase the odds of having a boy.  Move at high speed towards the egg. Interesting but out of your control.   Characteristics of girl sperm  What this means to you  Are identified as looking like an X. Interesting – some people remember the differences because they claim that the extra arm on the x indicates more strength.  Are more resilient and live for longer than Y sperm. This means they can still fertilise the egg 4-5 days after they have left the man’s body. You don’t need to be so particular about timing sex to coincide with ovulation. Female sperm can wait around for longer until the egg is ready to be fertilised.  Require less ‘nurturing’ to find their way to the egg. Interesting, but you don’t need to do anything consciously to look after them. Just don’t douche.  Move more slowly than Y sperm but retain their energy. Again, you don’t need to do anything in particular. Timing of intercourse The timing of when a couple has sex is thought to actually make a difference in helping to conceive with a boy. It is one of the strategies suggested in The Shettles Method , which claims that the chances of having a boy are boosted when conception occurs as close to ovulation as possible. Boy or Y sperm are not as resilient as the X or female sperm, and according to Shettles it may help to provide a bit of additional support in supporting the Y sperm to get to their destination and not have to compete any more than they absolutely have to.    Of course, this all depends on the willingness of a couple to track the woman’s ovulation and be available to each other over those crucial fertile hours. According to Shettles, if you want a boy then avoid having sex:  no earlier than 24 hours before you are about to “ovulate”/conception/ovulation.  not after 12 hours since you have ovulated.  Shettles also advises that if couples want to conceive with a boy:  Best positions : deep penetrative sex is preferable. This helps to deposit the semen and sperm closest to the woman’s cervix so they are given the best opportunity to get to the egg in the fallopian tube. Twelve hours before ovulation is thought to maximise the chances of conceiving with a boy.  It also helps if the woman orgasms. This boosts the alkaline properties of the vagina which again, supports the sperm to do their work. Orgasm also causes uterine and vaginal contractions which help to push the sperm upwards where they need to go.  How do I know when I’ve ovulated?  Many women develop a distinctive pain on one side of their lower pelvis, which occurs mid-way through their monthly cycle.  Changes in the cervical mucous. Fertile mucous is clear, watery and stretchy – it appears similar to egg white. The cells change to encourage the smooth passage of sperm upwards through the cervix towards the fallopian tubes. Fertile mucous is also less acidic than non-fertile mucous and this environment favours the sperm rather than killing them off.  You could try using an ovulation testing kit . These detect hormonal changes which occur at ovulation, particularly an increase in Luteinizing Hormone. But there is still some disagreement over their effectiveness. Kits cost anywhere between $25.00 – $40.00.  You may feel different. Women who have ovulated and are at their most fertile often experience and increase in their libido, they appear more attractive and are more relaxed.  An increase in your basal body temperature . This is the lowest temperature which is attained by your body during rest and sleep. Just before ovulation occurs there is a rise in the temperature by a couple of degrees. If you are trying to conceive a boy, then it can be useful to chart your basal body temperature for a few months so you know your peak times of fertility.  General tips to help conceive a boy  Caffeine may help to give the Y laden sperm an additional boost. An energy drink, cup of coffee or even some chocolate before having sex won’t do any harm.  Suggest your partner change his underpants preference if he’s into the tighter briefs. Boxer shorts may look less glamorous but they don’t ‘hug’ the testicles close to the body and cause them to overheat.  This in turn, can reduce the number of sperm which are produced and in turn, the likelihood of conceiving with a boy.  What about the food I’m eating? It does seem that male sperm prefer an alkaline vaginal environment, which is where the correlation between diet and gender selection comes in. But whether or not eating a less acidic diet makes a difference is still open to debate. But it probably does no harm. If you want to conceive a boy baby then you may want to consider eating less of these types of foods:  Spicy foods which contain vinegar, citrus juices and fruits and tart/tangy flavours.  Avoid eating dairy foods such as milk, cheese, youghurt and ice-cream.  Eat more foods which contain potassium such as bananas, broccoli, potatoes, spinach and brussel sprouts.  Some researchers believe that taking a daily supplement of Evening Primrose Oil boosts the chances of conceiving a boy.  Try eating more of these foods:  Bread, avocado, almonds, sprouts and wheatgrass.  Pine nuts and cherries.

You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys.  Or if you've only had girls, maybe you "just can't make" a boy.  Well, think again.  Remember that looking at very small data samples (two or three children) is very misleading: so let's take a look at data for over 6,000 American families , and find out:   Do parents tend to keep having children to try for a boy or a girl?  Are you more likely to keep having the same gender if you already have boys or girls?  What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio    Total Boys/Girls in Study  Boys  6,389  51%  Girls  6,135  49%  Total  12,524   The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates.  There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so.  Here are a couple of the theories:  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's).  The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance.  As Dr. Shettles theorized , Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions.  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population.  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?  Do parents tend to keep having children in hopes of having a boy or a girl?  In some cultures, there is a strong desire for a son, but parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender.  Here's what the data shows:  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?   Having a second child doesn't seem to be influenced by the gender of the first child: the outcome is very nearly even, with parents being just slightly more likely to stop at one child if the child is a girl.    First Child Parents Having 2nd Child  Boy 70%  Girl 68%   Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?   Parents are somewhat more likely to have a third child if the first two children are the same gender; slightly more so if both are boys.    Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Boy/Boy 46%  Girl/Girl 43%  Boy/Girl 39%   Combining boy/boy and girl/girl, we see:   Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child  Same Gender 45%  Mixed Gender 39%   What about the fourth child?   Surprisingly, parents 2 boys and 1 girl are the most likely to have a 4th child, even more so than parents of all boys or all girls.  Conversely, parents of 2 girls and 1 boy are least likely to have a 4th child.    Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  3 Boys 29%  2 Boys, 1 Girl 35%  1 Boy, 2 Girls 20%  3 Girls 26%   Combining this into same-gender and mixed-gender families, it turns out they are almost equally likely to have a 4th child, although same-gender families are slightly more likely.   Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child  Same Gender 28%  Mixed Gender 26%   The Odds of Having a Another Boy or Girl  Okay, finally!  Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.  Odds of Having a Girl After 1, 2, or 3 Boys  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly .  Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.   Previous Children Percentage of Girl Births after Boys  None  49%   1 Boy  50%   2 Boys  47.7%   3 Boys  43.6%   Odds of Having a Boy After 1, 2, or 3 Girls  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.   Previous Children Percentage of Boy Births after Girls  None 51%  1 Girl 54.5%  2 Girls 46.0%  3 Girls 52.7%   Gender and Birth Order  Given the data above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children.  This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio.  This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc.   Percentage of Boy Births by Birth Order  1st Born 51.0%  2nd Born 52.2%  3rd Born 48.6%  4th Born 50.8%  What's it all mean?   Although we often hear the "statistic" that you are 30% or even 70% more likely to keep having the same gender, this is just an old wives tale .  It is NOT a fact. The truth is, your odds stay pretty close to 50% for each child and only vary slightly.  If you have had 2 or 3 boys, you are only very slightly more likely to have another boy.  If you have had girls, you are slightly more likely to have a boy next. Don't believe that you can "only make" boys or girls -- most likely, it's only chance!  You'll also want to see: What are the odds of having all boys or all girls?             Gender Odds   What are the odds of having another boy or girl?

Reply  Close M  MamaHLB Also wondering if anyones "Mommy Intuition" has been wrong in regards to what they're having. I had no feeling with my first 2 or mc but had a feeling with my 3rd Boy. I have a feeling this is a Boy too but this is the earliest I have ever had a feeling and am wondering if its just because I already have 3 Boys so I think I just don't make Girls? Reply  Close A  ADub311 It's always 50/50, it's just scientific fact. Intuition- I dreamed my first was a boy several times. Even after I found out she was a girl I dreamed the nurse removed the swaddle and I saw boy parts. lol I had them confirm she was still a girl. I have 2 girls. I'm hoping this is a boy!

However, I do have a strong feeling this one is a girl. I keep calling the embryo she etc. Reply  Close n  no3112 Have you ever heard of shettles? It claims that there is some science behind getting one gender over the other. According to shettles, male sperm are faster but die quicker and female sperm are slower but live longer. The closer to ovulation you dtd, the higher your chances are for a boy. But I think this only slightly increases your odds either way. It's still basically 50/50. I have 2 boys and my dh and I really want this one to be a girl. I have a strong feeling it is a girl although I'm not sure if it's because that's what we want lol Reply  Close M  MamaChrista It's really 50/50 lol you said. My husband is one of 7 boys no girls. I'm the only girl with two brothers. Everyone thought we'd have a boy bc of my husbands side being all boys and we have a 19 mo girl. Reply  Close J  Jmom10912 I have 3 girls, 14, 4 and 2. (Oldest is my stepdaughter) The 4 yo I had two dreams about her being a girl. The 2 yo I was thinking boy, but knew my husband really wanted it to be a boy. (We thought we were done) Not sure what I think this time. Ha  I do know two families with b,b,b,g and don't know any personally with 4 boys. Although I know several with 4 girls.  We are hoping to break the pattern in our family. Sister has 3 boys, brother has 3 boys, BIL has 2 boys and we have 3 girls. Nobody has both. Reply  Close M  MamaChrista @MamaHLB  your husband's sperm is who decides the sex of the baby. Women all provide an X chromosome, and the husband provides the y or x chromosome that determines the sex. XY-boy XX-girl. With my dd we really wanted a boy but my intuition said she was a girl. For this baby my intuition says it's a girl again. Reply  Close g  garciakm So antiquated but my family swears by the hair tests.  1. Cowlick on the left - girl next 2. Cowlick on the right - boy next  Or  If the hairline in the back at the top of the neck comes to a point it will be opposing gender but if it goes straight across it will be the same gender.  Good luck! I'd love a boy next but hairtests tel me girl ha ha!!!! Reply  Close V  VeronicaAnnette I really think it's 50/50, but I sure hope it leans towards girl this time! We have a 6yr old boy and a 3 yr old boy, and this is our last baby. Crossing our fingers for some pink in our future! Reply  Close M  MamaHLB I love reading everyones responses, thank you! I had no intuition/clue what I was having with my first 2 Boys and I convinced myself although we never found out that the Baby I miscarried was a little Girl, and then I had an intuition with my 13mo Boy that he was a Boy even though We didn't find out until he was born. This time around I had dreams I was pregnant with a little Girl for the 3 days before I took my positive pregnancy test but just within the last few days I am convinced I am having a Boy. I am only 5 weeks and 4 days and I am not sure if Mother's Intuition is right this time or if that gets jaded when you have all these other feelings surrounding it such as hoping its a Girl since its our last and wanting My Husband and I to get to experience that. My Father and oldest Son have also expressed hope that its a Girl so I am wondering if I am thinking its a Boy now in hopes to prepare myself in case its not and because I think I only make Boys? My oldest Son thinks its a Girl but he thought my 13mo was a Girl too. Anyone have a similar experience with any of their gender stuff during pregnancies or know how I am feeling?

Reply  Close d  djawho920 It's really 50/50 no matter what. My cousin had 3 boys and when she got pregnant with her 4th, she had made sure to try all those methods to get a girl even the craziest one, and #4 was a boy. She cried and cried, not because she was unhappy with another healthy boy but she knew it was her last and was simply mourning the fact she'd never have a daughter of her own. I've always been right with my intuition, although with #3 I started second guessing. I have a girl and then 2 boys. I am feeling like this one is a boy but we shall see! Hope you get your little girl! Reply  Close k  katieisreversed I have a 2 year old son and really hoping for a girl this time! My grandma has 5 boys, my uncle has 4 boys, I have 2 brothers, and my other uncles each have one girl and 2 boys. Since having a girl comes from your so side look at his family and see. My so is one of 4 2 boys and 2 girls. His 2 sisters have a different dad though so he has 1 full brother. So I would say my chances of having another boy are pretty high.
